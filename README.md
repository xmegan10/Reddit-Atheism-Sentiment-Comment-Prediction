(Work in Progress)

This project uses PRAW to scrape posts and comments from the Atheism subreddit and tries to predict overall comment sentiment based on a user's post title, body, and type of media uploaded.
After creating a model for the Atheism subreddit, I will try to apply this same framework to other subreddits with similar content, like religious/political/debating subreddits.
