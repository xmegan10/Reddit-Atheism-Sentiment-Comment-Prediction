x40bca,Joe Biden's speech on Democracy could lead to more incensed pastors speaking about politics from the pulpit this Sunday. Here is the IRS form to report churches for political influence.,[deleted],57098,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/x40bca/joe_bidens_speech_on_democracy_could_lead_to_more/,"Originally posted by [u/skipperdogs](https://www.reddit.com/u/skipperdogs/) in [r/exchristians](https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristians/) and posted to r/atheism byu/moschocolate1. Now is a great time to remind everyone, because Biden's speech on Democracy is already causing the evangelical right to go into overdrive, and the chances of pastors violating their tax exempt status this Sunday by exercising political influence are especially high. It's a great time to hold them accountable.

Here's the post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/uwhjdj/time\_for\_a\_new\_challenge/](https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/uwhjdj/time_for_a_new_challenge/)

The basics:

Some atheists are now going to services to monitor political influence used by preachers, priests, etc., and reporting them for violation of their tax-exempt status.

Use form [IRS 13909](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f13909.pdf), and check boxes 3-5 or those that apply.

Also use [form 211](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f211.pdf) to claim whistle blower reward.

Here's the image: [https://i.imgur.com/6TVglyb.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/6TVglyb.jpg)

Edit: Many services are transmitted on-line, for those of you who may be too uncomfortable going to a service in person. I understand that hearing these sermons again can be stressful and traumatic, but this is a great opportunity to fight back against how damaging political rhetoric from the pulpit is for the country and for those of us who had to endure it as children until we were able to leave.",1650,1662121804.0

She attends public school, but they allowed the local church to hold a club there. They do a lot of arts and crafts and fun activities, so she begged and begged me to let her join. I am atheist, and anti-religion but I also believe in letting my kids make their own choices. So that’s why I allowed her to join. Part of the process of signing up was giving my phone number and address to them. Pretty normal stuff right? They would send flyers home inviting kids to come to church on Sundays, but I would just ignore those. My daughter liked it for a while, but after a few months, told me she didn’t want to go anymore. So I took her out.

Fast forward to the middle of summer, a random car pulls up in our driveway on a Saturday, 4 people get out and are asking for my daughter by name. They said they were from the afterschool club/church. I was absolutely horrified!  
I said it was inappropriate of them to show up at my house, unannounced, asking for my seven year old. They said they were visiting all of the members of the club to invite them to come to church tomorrow. They even offered to pick her up? I told them no thank you, please do not come back and they left. 


Well, now that school has started again I immediately called the school and let them know what happened. I told them that I never gave them permission to use my address to come and visit my daughter and that it was very inappropriate. The school was horrified and said they had no idea that they did this, or would do this, when they had agreed to first let them hold a club there. 

I just found out today that the club will no longer be allowed at the school. That definitely was not my intention, but hopefully that will teach them not to misuse information to push their beliefs.

Montana Department of Revenue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espinoza_v._Montana_Department_of_Revenue) that private religious schools can get tax-supported scholarships. This essentially means the private religious schools can be funded by public tax dollars. This is a major defeat for the separation of church and state.

However, if religous schools are going to get government aid, then the schools should have to abide by the law. This should mean:

My parents even saw the news clip and paper articals. I then approached them again with what happened to me and they flipped saying satan made this, he didnt molest anyone and satan is using me against god.

Well. Here it is you assholes, the numbers show that if you identify as a Christian, you’re identifying as a hateful trump supporter. Think you’re one of those “good” ones who can change the momentum of an entire religious institution? Nope. You’re just telling me that it’s more important to have an identity as a christian than to actually live a life of kindness and love for others- because guess what, you don’t HAVE to be a part of a religion to believe and live those things, but you’ve chosen to stick by it regardless. 

In my opinion, if you wanted to truly be a part of a community that wanted to show love toward humans of this world, you would distance yourself as far away as possible from anything with such a toxic, political, hateful, exclusive, and selfish group if people. 

Rant over.

EDIT: To all those saying “not all christians”, my rant was not about how christianity can’t be kind and inclusive, the point is that- like it or not- you are choosing to identify with a large sector of the population who loudly and majority supports trash like Trump. Like it or not, that is what you’re identifying with right now. Anyone who is targeted by that bigoted rhetoric is going to stay far far away from you.

11kel4z,“Under god” needs to be removed from the U.S. Pledge of Allegiance.,BadLuck1968,29835,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/11kel4z/under_god_needs_to_be_removed_from_the_us_pledge/,"It was added by President Eisenhower in 1954 during the height of the red scare.

Let me repeat that: “Under God” was not in the original pledge.

What a joke??? We are essentially forcing children to pledge their allegiance to god every morning.

**Edit: I did not expect this to hit the front page, if only briefly.**

Given that this post will likely be found in the future, I want to provide some resources relevant to this debate and discuss the pledge more broadly.

Resources:

[This excellent article from Pew breaks down the pledge's history and the addition of ""Under God"" in 1954.](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2013/09/04/5-facts-about-the-pledge-of-allegiance/)

""**Congress added 'Under God' to the Pledge in 1954 – during the Cold War.** Many members of Congress reportedly wanted to emphasize the distinctions between the United States and the officially atheistic Soviet Union.""

**Relevant Supreme Court Rulings on the Pledge**

The Supreme Court case [**West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette**](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1940-1955/319us624) established that children may not be compelled to say the pledge at public schools. 

""In a 6-to-3 decision, the Court overruled its decision in Minersville School District v. Gobitis and held that compelling public schoolchildren to salute the flag was unconstitutional. In an opinion written by Robert Houghwout Jackson, the Court found that the First Amendment cannot enforce a unanimity of opinion on any topic, and national symbols like the flag should not receive a level of deference that trumps constitutional protections. He argued that curtailing or eliminating dissent was an improper and ineffective way of generating unity."" - Oyez

In 2004, the Supreme Court heard [**Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow**](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2003/02-1624)*,* a case brought by an atheist who said a California school’s pledge requirement violated his daughter’s rights under the First Amendment’s Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses.

The court did not rule on the legality of the words “Under God” in relation to the First Amendment, ultimately deciding that Newdow (the California plaintiff) did not have standing due to a lack of custody over his daughter. It was a really bad case and set future arguments against ""Under God"" up for failure.

Interestingly, Justices William Rehnquist, Sandra Day O’Connor, and Clarence Thomas wrote separate concurrences, stating that it is constitutional to require teachers to lead the pledge. 

**Relevant Lower Court Cases:** 

In 2014, the Massachusetts Supreme Court heard [**Jane Doe v. Acton-Boxborough Regional School District**](https://law.justia.com/cases/massachusetts/supreme-court/volumes/468/468mass64.html). The case involved a group of parents, teachers, and the American Humanist Association claiming that the Pledge requirement, including the use of the words “Under God,” violated the equal protection clause of the state’s constitution.

The Massachusetts Supreme Court did not agree. 

From the decision: ""They argue that, because the daily recitation of the pledge violates art. 106, it also violates § 5. For the same reasons we hold that the pledge does not violate art. 106, however, we also hold that it does not violate the statute. Moreover, as we have stated, reciting the pledge is a voluntary patriotic exercise, but it is not a litmus test for defining who is or is not patriotic. The schools confer no ""privilege"" or ""advantage"" of patriotism within the meaning of the statute to those who recite the pledge in its entirety.""

Despite the setback, the American Humanist Association wasn't finished. 

[**American Humanist Association v. Matawan-Aberdeen Regional School District**](https://casetext.com/case/am-humanist-assn-john-jane-doe-v-matawan-aberdeen-regl-sch-dist) was a New Jersey case from 2014 that sought to directly eliminate the use of the words “under God” from Pledges taken at public schools.

The New Jersey Supreme Court ultimately decided that the state law requiring schools to have a daily recitation of the Pledge did not violate the state's constitution.

Not only did they reject the case, but the decision also uses language that would make any future attempt at challenging ""Under God"" in New Jersey fairly interesting. 

From the decision: ""Over and over, from the writings of the founders of the Constitutions of both the United States and the State of New Jersey, emerges a faith in, and a reliance and even dependency upon God to help secure the blessings of liberties and freedom attendant upon good governance."" (*BARF*)

In 2019, Jabari Talbot, an 11-year-old student from Lakeland, Florida, was [arrested for ""causing a disturbance at school and resisting arrest.""](https://www.theledger.com/story/news/education/2019/03/06/polk-student-at-center-of-pledge-flap-sees-case-closed/5777369007/)

Her crime? Refusing to say the pledge. 

The charges were ultimately dropped, but the incident reignited efforts to end the pledge entirely. 

[In 2020, two DNC caucuses intentionally omitted “under God” from the Pledge of Allegiance, sparking a minor controversy.](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-pledge-allegiance-dnc/fact-check-the-2020-dnc-did-not-omit-under-god-from-every-pledge-of-allegiance-idUSKBN25M1OO)

As far as I am aware, that is the entire history of ""Under God"" and the pledge. I hope this helps someone down the line!

I live in a third world country (Uganda) and homosexuality will absolutely get you killed here at the very least brutally beaten up and arrested.
I have no choice but to marry a woman to keep up appearances. The marriage was arranged by my parents who are middle class and managed to secure me a girl from a very poor family. People don't really get married for love here like they do in the west. Many marriages here are simply for securing resources. My parents have always suspected me to be gay and have prayed for me thoroughly and pressured me into this marriage.

This is my only way I can keep my family whom I love very much and stafe safe from harms way. It will be an unfulfilling marriage but at least it will ensure my safety and enable me to have children I have always wanted. I have always hated religion ever since I came out to myself. I created this account to vent. Can't really talk to friends

EDIT: I would just like to say thanks to all Redditors and the atheist community for offering your support, kindness and understanding. The girl I will be marrying is kind, pretty and respectful. I have met her three times before our wedding and we are already good friends. Telling her about my sexuality and essentially giving her the tools to destroy me and that is something am absolutely NOT going to do anytime soon for as long as I remain in this country. In time I hope we can build a good friendship and trust. Some people think am selfish for not being honest but am sure she has secrets of her own she hasn't told me and I will always choose my life over anyone's peace of mind. I would rather lie and keep a secret than be honest and endanger my life.

For some reason I always predicted this happening to me because many gay men unfortunately go through exactly what am going through right now. The underground gay community is not something I have ever* encountered. I will be focusing my energy on saving so I can leave this country in the next five years atleast. Thank you for your well wishes and advice.",1326,1575224635.0

Here's where it gets even more bizarre. A few days later, she returns and tips my coworker a whopping $777.

Fast forward to today, and she's back again, adamant that her tips were somehow fraudulent and that we tampered with them. Her claims of fraud are literally impossible, we bring the card reader to the table, and it's the guest who decides the tip amount by either pressing a preset option or entering a custom one before hitting pay. That's exactly what she did. So, it's physically impossible for us to manipulate the tip amounts.

Both my coworker and I have already received our tips with our paychecks, and we obviously have to pay income tax on them. Returning the money to her at this point is literally impossible since we don't actually have all the money.

I hate fundamentalists.

This couldn't be more incorrect.

Criticizing priests for raping children is not hate speech.

Blasting the Catholic church for covering for pedophiles for decades is not hate speech. 

Blasting folks for still donating to an organization that admits that it has, for decades, covered for pedophiles is not hate speech. 

Being the first to shout ""fuck militant Islam"" after a terrorist attack is NOT hate speech. 

Telling the world that Nazis are fucking scum and deserve the guillotine after a Nazi shoots up a mosque is NOT hate speech. 


Hate speech is when a Christian pastor claims gays should be executed for simply being gay. 

Hate speech is when a Catholic compares gay folks to pedophiles while protecting actual pedophiles within the ranks of the church. 

Hate speech is saying that all atheists are immoral and deserve to be shunned for their beliefs.

Edit:  A few people have asked why the range is so dramatic.  The PPP release includes ranges for each loan meaning if a small business took a 1.5 million dollar loan, the spreadsheet would show 1-2 million.  I added all the lower limits and all the upper limits to get the final range.  The true number is definitely within that range, most likely in the middle.  I also accidentally added any company which includes the word church in their name like Churchill Bank (20-30 businesses), but I also omitted any church that does not include church in their name (I’m thinking this is offsets the 20-30 business I accidentally included.)",740,1594642503.0
