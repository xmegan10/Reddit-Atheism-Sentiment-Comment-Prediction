Should you happen to experience any PAWS (may not ever happen so this can be for others as well), I encourage you to look at ULDN (ultra low dose naltrexone) or LDN (if all the opioid is out of your system).  It is showing great promise for PAWS.  It has recently blown up as an off label treatment for fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, etc.

Again, you are amazing and please keep it up.   It's so worth it.

I pay my bills on time, im respected at my job, and I no longer cry for days knowing that I will be out of money soon and will have to prepare for withdrawal. Surround yourself with sober people. I literally had to block everyone I used to hang out with because they would always try to bring me into their drug drama and I had to choose myself. 

It's worth it. Keep going. Your future will be bright if you keep saying no. Withdrawals will calm, and you'll start remembering who you were before. Its better than any drug. I thought I hated myself. I hated myself so much. But I forgot who I was. Im not me in addiction.

There’s something to be said about learning how to listen to living things that can’t necessarily speak and understanding their needs.

51,n74ay06,1miidb8,They told me quitting would be the hardest thing I ever did. They were wrong.,johnny_19800,"He’s absolutely right. For me, the hardest part hasn’t been the detox, the restless nights, or even the physical pain, though I’ve had more than my share of that. It’s what comes after the chaos. When the noise stops. When there’s no pill, no patch, no escape hatch. Just me.

And facing myself without the fog? That’s the fight no one warned me about.

After nine years of opioid use through chronic pain, cancer, loss, trauma, and some brutal chapters, the real battle started when I got clean. When I was finally left alone with everything I had numbed for almost a decade. And I’ll be honest, there are nights it still feels unbearable. I have had to sit with emotions that used to take me out completely.

But I’m still here. And every single day I stay clean, I build a version of myself that is a little stronger, a little more honest, a little more me.

It doesn’t even get me high, it just makes me okay with just living a mundane life and accepting the emptiness of the physical world we live in.

I’m a fairly spiritual person but the more years have passed the less ambition I have to stay in the physical realm that we know as earth and the universe. I have been fairly successful at life, did higher education got high paying jobs, even had a long term partner whom I married but have since separated from. I cannot for the life of me figure out why I’m still alive or if I have any purpose at all outside of surviving and being bored to tears after having done most things that are supposed to be life’s greatest joys.

It gives ( likely much like ""the Gardner"" in the thread) it gives me time to think just to myself ( Not many people offer to join me on a five Mile walk daily). Sometimes I do it with no music or no podcast/ earbuds in... I just allow myself to be silent and look around and observe anything in the nature around me. But I've also picked up on some very interesting podcasts / audible books. It feels like gently learning while healing. But, watch yourself, I found myself trying to ""get the years back"" in rather self destructive ways also.....only realizing that shit didn't matter.

It’s a difficult and sometimes long road, but absolutely worth it. You will find something…but sometimes we have to try everything first. Another big issue of mine was all the negative self talk that has been ingrained from an early age. That’s a difficult one, with lots of tiny tiny steps. Just try to notice the steps and it will help. It definitely feels empty…I still feel empty. Opiates gave me a false sense of a loving upbringing, the warmest hug, acceptance and confidence to be me…when the opiates are gone, it’s pretty hard not to feel empty. You almost have to re parent yourself and it may take decades. It is worth it though. All of us feel empty to a certain degree, but eventually with a lot of work you will feel less empty.

I find certain qigong techniques work to feel present and slow down my nervous system and having easy Reno projects at home, playing and writing music, and drawing helped.

I also would like the opportunity to tell you, thankyou so very much for sharing this, it cant have been easy for you fam.
I dont have CHS but I do have CVS (cyclic vomiting syndrome). It's often mistaken for CHS, especially if you're someone like myself who uses weed for severe nausea and to be able to eat/sleep. Not daily, not a lot of it, but still, I smoke too. CVS and the active vomitting stage - the same as a CHS episode. Its like opiate and benzo withdrawals, at the same time, x10. Mental, physical and even physiological torture. My episodes can last up 2 weeks, vomitting my stomach lining up 5-8 times an hour 24/7. Within 2 hours of going into active vomitting, I'm unable to speak, move or even turn sideways to be sick safely, by myself. Im totally useless to myself and dependent on other people, trapped in my own body that's actively torturing me. My body has gotten into trouble and I've been rushed to hospital unconscious more times than I can count...Bc of CVS, dehydration and the toll such violent repetitive vomitting takes on a very frail body.
The drs...their first line of defence with these conditions is to calm the extreme panic and anxiety these conditions cause, and to regain brain/gut axis control. I too, am prescribed liquid diazepam and oral disperse lorazepam, for when I'm in the active cycle. My fluid intake and BP has to be monitored the whole time and I'm not ever to be left alone to fight an episode, they can be life threatening every time. I'm 41 (f) and can honestly say, I wouldn't wish that disease or anything similar to it, on Satan himself. I lost 85lbs in less the 12m bc of it and am battling to get myself back up to 100lbs. Its truly an awful, awful, life and soul destroying, disease. 
Im telling you this bc I can understand your wife's desperation to get a break from the relentless, unbearable torture. I can understand being that delirious from your body and mind battling so much at once - the confusion and the weakness, that you swallow pill after pill to try and relieve the choking tightness, pain and wanting to rip your own skin off - you'd honestly do anything to get a break from the 24/7 hell thats unlike anything you've ever experienced before. Again, WDS included ^^ 
Hearing your and your wife's heartbreaking story - i cant tell you I'm sorry for your loss enough, my heartfelt condolences OP. But I also want to tell you thank you for sharing bc Im gonna ask my dr to try something else than the sedatives, in my own treatment plan. 
Prayers up fam 🙏",27,t3_1lqnn9b

Honestly, CHS is a big part if not the only reason that I have a dependency on opioids in the first place—But I made my decisions.

I’m truly sorry for your loss—my heart goes out to you. CHS is very real, and awareness around it is still way too low.

With today’s high-potency THC products becoming more common, stories like Natasha’s are going to become more important—and unfortunately, more frequent.

I’d encourage you to share her story in the CHS subreddit. For many of us, it’s hard to accept that we may never be able to use THC again without consequences. Denial runs deep. I still struggle with it sometimes. But recovery begins with acceptance—and stories like hers could be exactly what someone needs to hear to start that process.

I've been trying to figure out a way to end ""the war on drugs"".

I know that's probably the last thing you'd advocate for, but I stole an idea from Hamilton Morris when he was on Joe Rogan. He compared drugs to any number of tools or inventions that... on their own are fairly harmless, but could be used for harm with blatant disrespect. I think he compared drug use to driving. Millions have died in vehicle accidents, but there are a lot of things that have been done since the 1920's to mitigate the harm. Road signs, speed limits, traffic tickets, and most importantly... a fairly lengthy license procedure (drivers ed). We should do the same for adults over 21 who want to use drugs. Have at least a 40 hour class on drug classes, drug interactions, pharmacology, spotting overdoses from ALL drugs, etc. 

Our drug laws, and availability of drugs are really strange right now. It REALLY gets me upset to hear stories like this. It's almost like the topic of drug use, even legal drug use, is so taboo, that even out own doctors are clueless! For example, I had a 5 week hospital stay, and I have a history of opioid use. Just to get opioids for pain during my stay, my lawyer had to threaten a lawsuit. Every week or so, it was the same BS. A new team of doctors would rotate onto my floor, and get all weird with my opioid meds. Mind you, I'm on the bare minimum of allowable pain meds, and I'm writhing in pain, barely sleeping. Well one doctor came in and wanted to see if ""this new great pain med"" would work for me. So she started me on gabapentin. I had been familiar with gabapentin for a decade, but it was like she just discovered it, so I told her it was similar to valium or alcohol. She seemed skeptical. Anyway, long story short, I actually slept that night, and when nurses came in to take blood at 5 am I told them to piss off. Next thing I know, I have 4 or 5 people around me about to narcan my ass! The doc who prescribed the gabapentin accused me of getting friends to smuggle opioids into my room, and put this giant camera thing right next to me. You know, to see where I was getting these ""drugs"". Like 2 days later, she took out the camera and told me that I should've become a doctor, because I was correct about gabapentin working on the GABA receptors. For the rest of the week she bribed me with dilaudid to do PT. 

I know that was a long, and perhaps pointless story, but I think it says a lot about the state of our medical system. Especially when it comes to drugs ""of abuse"". But it says even more about our backwards ass drug laws. 

Take Marijuana for example. What, like half if the states sell ""legal"" weed, and the other half use some loophole where they can use ""legal"" hemp to extract cannabanoids? Yet on the federal level, Marijuana is still a schedule 1 drug. Same as Heroin and LSD. Which means there is no medicinal value, and a high potential for abuse. 

Yet... the drugs of abuse commonly used today, are actually schedule 2 or lower! Isn't that wild? Fentanyl - Schedule 2. Cocaine - Schedule 2. Methamphetamine - schedule 2. Benzos - schedule 3. Ketamine - (I think) schedule 3. 

So... like who the fuck are we really protecting here? What the hell is going on? We lock up hippies and at this point boutique heroin users who need to order it from overseas... while the streets are awash with essentially drugs that are deemed ""medically necessary"" or are technically LEGAL uncontrolled research chemicals. 

God, it's a mess! 

As ""free"" adults, we should have the ability to use drugs. However, these drugs should be pure, and come from a knowledgeable source. Preferably a doctor or pharmacist who deals 100% with psychoactive drugs. Someone who could've taken one look at baby cakes and said ""it's the weed""! Stop using Marijuana, take showers to help with the nausea, here's some nausea meds, stay hydrated, and let me know if you need anything else. 

Instead, you got some clueless bonehead who killed your girl and should probably loose their license over this... if not be sued for millions of dollars. 

Again, I'm truly sorry for your loss.",16,t3_1lqnn9b

CHS isn't complex, your body didn't like high amounts of THC for long periods of time.

123,n14nmis,1lqnn9b,My wife died at 32 from CHS + overprescribed Xanax. Please hear this.,Elvis_Take_The_Wheel,"Oh my God, I am so sorry for you that my heart hurts. I recently lost a friend to somewhat similar circumstances, although she had been overprescribed Xanax for cyclic vomiting syndrome, not CHS. For the people in the comments here who don't understand the violence of constant nausea, be aware that it's possible to vomit so hard and so often that you tear a hole in your esophagus and bleed out. My friend had taken her Xanax to sleep and was unconscious when she began vomiting. Her death was a combination of blood loss from the esophageal tear, asphyxiation, and the respiratory depression caused by the benzo. But she also had a history of addiction and NEVER should have been prescribed that much.

So her doctor was aware of her cannabinoid use? If he was and didn't IMMEDIATELY recognize she had cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome, he needs to lose his license for that alone. With the rise of high-THC products these days, CHS has been absolutely everywhere in the medical literature and he would've had to have had blinders on not to have seen something about it. The only thing she should've been prescribed is Zofran for the nausea. 

The fact that he knew her addiction history and repeatedly prescribed a benzo makes me ill. Once you reach the point in your grieving where you are able to function again, PLEASE contact [your state's medical board](https://www.fsmb.org/contact-a-state-medical-board/) to file a complaint. Her doctor is actively endangering his patients and he needs to answer for how negligent he was.

Take care, OP. 💔",2,t3_1lqnn9b

Complications from CHS can kill you, and it's often not taken seriously in the ER. Your organs, for starters, can begin to shut down from the vomiting if you're unable to eat, which is common with CHS. There has been at least one recorded death due to CHS.

A lot of people go back to weed and/or try to moderate it, which can cause more severe episodes, increasing your risk.

145,n152lke,1lqnn9b,My wife died at 32 from CHS + overprescribed Xanax. Please hear this.,Away-Hippo-8052,"Here’s what I know from living through it with her and the massive amount of research I've done:

Natasha mostly smoked high-THC flower and vaped carts. Occasionally dabs when she was desperate for nausea relief. She never really used edibles.

She started smoking in her early teens. By her 30s, it was multiple times per day—wake and bake, bedtime, and in between. Sometimes to calm anxiety, sometimes just to feel normal.

At first, weed helped her get off harder stuff. But over time, it turned on her—CHS (Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome) doesn’t care about your intentions. It just happens once the body says “enough.”

So does it matter how you use it?

Kind of—but not in the way people think.

It’s not really about smoking vs. vaping vs. edibles—it’s about total THC exposure over time.

The more your body is exposed to THC, especially high-potency concentrates or flower above 20%, the more it builds up in your fat and nervous system. Eventually, for some people, that buildup triggers CHS—a cycle of extreme nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and dehydration that gets worse every time you use, even in small doses.

Can it happen to new users?

Rarely—but yes. Most CHS patients are daily users for years before symptoms show. But there are cases of it happening earlier, especially with strong dabs or oils in people who have low cannabinoid tolerance or unique metabolism.

Xanax made it worse.

Once she started using Xanax for the CHS nausea, it numbed her out. That’s what benzos do. But in someone with a past history of heroin and benzo addiction, it was a time bomb. They’re so hard to get off. You don’t just stop—you crash.

The doctor never should’ve prescribed it long-term. Especially not knowing her history.


This was a perfect storm:
CHS from long-term weed use.
Benzos that numbed her instead of helping her heal.
And a system that didn’t listen until it was too late.


If this helped even one person check their habits or talk to their doctor—then her story is still doing good in this world.

Thank you for reading it. Truly.",7,t1_n14wb29

Weed gave me a zen like headspace, I could  think clearly & meditate for the first time in my life—I've got ADHD so the dopaminergic effect coupled with the zen like headspace for contemplation felt like a superpower. 

Opioids give me some temporary euphoria but my gym performance sucks, I cut myself off to the world (social life) and don't attend classes as a part of that.

And yea the cravings honestly are the worst part. All the time it’s all I can ever think about. Relapse seems like the easiest way out for sure, but it definitely will come with tons more issues. Good on you for putting the foot down and making sure u never touch them again.

195,m3a539g,1hisl61,I'm officially one year clean from opiates!!!,Sianarasammy,"Yooo great job on a year off opiates. 

I (33m) can’t help but see and hear myself in your story there. I started using drugs at around 13 and then started using opiates around 16/17 and man I was off to the races for a while. And when I was 18 and about to go off to college I did exactly what you did, got off opiates because THEY were the problem. But I kept smoking weed and drinking and partying. I also kept my opiate use a secret from all family and significant who truly mattered. 

I’m not saying this will be your story but I only say all this to say, my time off opiates that go around was SHORT LIVED. I made it about a year and a half but without significant members of my life to keep me accountable and then still partying was a bad combo for me. I went back after someone had offered me a pill and i had a bad hangover. Back to the races. 

I had one other stint of “sobriety” when i self maintained with suboxone and still partied hard AF but eventually it led me to heroin because it was all I could afford. 

Again, I only say this to share my experience. But I couldn’t get sober until I shared my struggles with my family and the significant figures in my life. They love you and they will want to help keep you clean. I felt nothing but support from them (unless the support I wanted was to keep getting high.) and I highly recommend you check out a 12 step fellowship. I got sober from everything and Heroin in AA, CA and HA. There’s a lot more A’s than you think! But yeah I now have 7 years sober and shit has never been better! 

Sorry for yapping I just wish someone had told me something similar early on. 

No matter what you decide to do I wish you the best my friend and great job kicking the pills!",1,t3_1hisl61

I couldn't imagine trying to get off this shit but being so depressed I can't get out of bed in the morning at the same time. I think that really shows how society as a whole needs to change it's views on addiction. If someone is popping oxys all day and they don't even wanna get out of bed or greet the day then why do we think its gonna be helpful to call them drug addicts and junkies and such. If we want to make recovery more accessible and give those who submit themselves to addiction a chance at new life then that stigma around opioids (and to an extent all hard drugs) has got to go.",2,t1_m38slds

So many times when I was trying to get clean I romanticized and only remembered the good parts of using.  It always led me to a relapse and right back to all the terrible things that my mind was able to block out after a little clean time.   I just celebrated 5 years last week.

I found it really helpful to just repeat to yourself ""We're already x amount of time clean, why stop now?"". Any progress is good progress yk. I doubt I'm ever gonna forget that fear because sometimes it's so petrifying that I get panic attacks at the idea of relapsing. That's actually why I started smoking weed because it allowed me to stop hyperventilating so much and actually think my way through the idea of relapsing without turning into a jumbled-up ball of tears.

However, even if he does relapse, I am glad he has you supporting him and cheering for him.  It is ESSENTIAL to have a support system.

Even “good” fentanyl was horrible by the end of my use.

I moved down to Mexico and was talking to some guys who sold dope out of a pharmacia. They told us how there was lots of heroin on Mexican streets cuz they didn’t want their people messing with fentanyl so the cartel kept a lot of heroin production for Mexicans and sent us all the fentanyl.

What you said might be true to an extent about Mexican heroin, but i think it also has to do with tar being more popular than powder there. it's always been easier to find fent free tar than powder in general (my h only sample was a tar sample, I am east coast which made it even more rare and it isn't available all the time, at least not from that source).

Always quick to respond. Always professional, always straight business. His bags always had a little extra, but never less. I never had a plug as solid as him. I just recently sobered up again but am driving down today, and it’s a 2.5hr drive (each way) just to square up with him with what I still owe (not even to cop) AND am throwing him an xtra $500 cash in a Christmas card. 

Was he my friend? Not really. I know that we can’t ever really be friends but I always wished that one day I’d be completely sober and he’d make it out of the city, raise a nice family and live a fulfilling life. And maybe one day I’d be at a nice cafe or a restaurant and I’d look up from my newspaper and he’d be sitting there with his family and we’d lock eyes for a moment.

357,m3rtxtz,1hle0i3,Your Plug is NOT your Friend ,gt2carrera4,"I'll just go ahead and speak for myself and those who find themselves either in the minority here or are the exception to the proverbial rule from my own experience. 

My plug, a 67 y/o hood-hardened OG, who lives in a run-down, shitty-looking BUT impeccably clean and extravagantly decorated rowhouse apartment about 7-8 blocks away from Kensington Ave in Philly - aka the capital of ""Leantown, USA"" - always was and STILL IS a very mother-like figure to me (39M) on many levels. 

She INSTANTLY supported me when I entered treatment. She texted me frequently during the first few rough days and called me once a week to both check in on me and provide SINCERE encouragement. There's never once been even an ounce of deception in her doing so, and she's never once tried to stray me off my successful path to sobriety. It's honestly hard for me to even fathom her doing anything remotely deviant, considering how close we remain. 

Even if I were to somehow decide to merely ATTEMPT to throw my 11 months of sobriety away and go to HER with intent to cop something, not only would she flat out REFUSE to deal me anything, she'd literally stop everything she was doing, sit me down, and straighten me right the fuck out!

Now, DO NOT get me wrong here; this is NOT AT ALL how usual plug <-> user ""relationships"" work. I must also CLEARLY state that I 100% absolutely agree, in general, with the message/statement of this thread. 

Nonetheless, in my very unorthodox case, I truly can not emphasize enough how meaningful that breath of fresh air was to me early on in my recovery, knowing that she would remain a true ally and will always have MY best interests at heart.

Anything related to ""business"" is never brought up and has consequentially become an off-limits topic without any sort of agreement (unless I'M the one asking a specific question about how the ""business culture"" has changed, etc.) Even if we do fall out of touch someday, I KNOW that there will never, ever be any hard feelings between us.

To quote her: ""As long as we're both healthy and alive, we're jive!""",2,t3_1hle0i3

When I told him I wanted to get sober, he got me into see the doctor, and drove me there and then to the pharmacy everyday until I could get weekly carry. He also gave a job cleaning his house, and kept all the drug stuff away from me. He was a good guy. Even when I was in the middle of active addiction, and homeless no matter what time it was I could call him or just show up and he’d let me crash in his spare room. He died of lung cancer two years ago. And I’m 15 years sober.

He hit me up and was hoping to chill, sounded like he wasnt trying to get back into the game. It was really tough for me to cut him off. I tried to explain why, and eventually he let it go. I really hope hes doing well, dude deserves a shot at a better life than he or any of his family have ever had the opportunity to have.

Just wish the brothers I lost during that fucked up addiction could’ve made it back to this side.

Well long story short a lot of bad shit happened to me and I went broke for a little bit. Bro literally gave me my percs and lean everyday for free or whatever little bred I had to spend. Nd mind u you guys know how much real roxys are. Nd my body physically needed 60mgs just to be able to function and get some sleep and shit. He didn’t have to do that for me at all he could’ve easily been like fuck off we genuinely became brothers. Nd he didn’t really understand how it felt to feel how I was feeling when I would go to his crib sick af needing yerks to feel better. But he knew I was a good kid and trustworthy. He never sweated me to pay him back nd still would let me cop and shit before I got sober. I’ve tried to cop since I’ve been home and sober from rehab he won’t even serve me he refuses he said if I relapse he’ll kick my ass.

If the issue is with thirst, why isn’t kratom sold WITH ELECTROLYTES as part of the substance?  Should.  Especially in KratomAde packs of powdered drink mix that looks like a packet of electrolytes drink mix…for one example.

Why doesn’t OPMS include instructions about increasing fluids instead of removing the products as the FDA has requested?",5,t1_m3mlvhm

Probably 10-20 shots per day with beer on the side along with 4-6 10mg pills per day. Life was great to me. I had such a tolerance I could function just fine. Most didn’t even realize I was high, except like on certain weekends when partying was the main agenda. I was always happy, fun, loved everyday. Was always in that just right euphoria state of mind. Then I got cirrhosis of the liver. I had to quit. I know it was the best for me, I was literally killing myself probably. I was 59 and it was around 1.5 years ago when I was diagnosed. I am still pretty happy. I have been a Christian (I say Christ follower now because of the type of Christians that are getting publicly these days is not what I am) but have been one all my life, even during all the partying. We aren’t perfect. But anyway I have leaned on Him a lot during all this recovering. He has helped a lot, well I mean more than a lot even. Being honest I still do kratom, I have done it a lot for a long time between dry spells and stuff, and it does not seem to effect my liver because my tests have been coming back great. I was blessed to catch it early and I am still very healthy. Just recently I have really been missing the booze and pills times, I guess the season and stuff brings it on sometimes. I try to look at sobriety as its own buzz lol. I feel a lot more present now in situations so I am goi g with that and I just am noticing all the little stuff I missed by being drunk all the time before. It is like getting to know yourself for real lol. I still try and be happy and fun all the time and pretty much I am. I wont lie though and say I don’t miss it a lot too.

Too bright, too loud, too everything. It's very isolating. It just takes time. You've got to give your mind time to get its bearings and start rebuilding a new life.

When I first got clean and my life started getting better, I naively thought it was just up and up. I went through a rough time at 3-4 years clean (major depression, anemia, the loss of someone who was like family to me). I nearly killed myself, but instead I relapsed. Now I went through the same thing last year when I left my ex that turned into an alcoholic and cheated on me. 

The difference is that I knew my life would get better if I DIDNT self-destruct like I always did in the past. That was probably the most painful break up I went through in my life. We were together 7 years. I made it through that break up time though. Then he died this year. It was pretty supernatural though, i actually got to talk to him the night he died. I hadn’t talked to him in months, but i he texted me and i felt like I should call him for some reason. We had a great conversation, but i could tell he wasn’t clean. He apologized and i got to tell him that i love him, but i don’t want to be with him anymore.

So when you try to live sober, you’re separated from your addict friends and dealer “friends”, but you haven’t had time to build new relationships yet. So you’re literally stuck in the middle trying to fight through all by yourself. It’s really hard. For so long the pills were my best friend.  When they weren’t there anymore, I felt so lonely.

It’s one of the loneliest journeys with support everywhere but it’s a physical, internal and mental job.

The judgement of my addiction is nothing compared to theirs, my cancer is nothing compared to theirs and pretty much my entire story and experience is nothing in comparison to theirs. Whatever happened to just sharing one’s story and helping one another in areas that we can understand and just being honest about those we can’t help in. Just because one feels lonely, alone and isolated, it doesn’t mean that one is looking for a best friend. Some just want a real human connection even if it’s only for a conversation and connection for the moment. Life does the rest.

I feel like I'm over the physical shit and yesterday was my last day of hell. I thought I was about to go back into withdrawals but I technically literally never stopped withdrawing since last weeks Monday so 2 weeks STRAIGHT and I mean every fucking day all day the worst you can think I went through it. Every symptom highest it's ever been I felt. I feel great I've worked out today (a little) I've eaten finally and I started a subreddit and got meta certified and started content on my Instagram so it's been a breakthrough day since I chatted in this subreddit.

471,ne19ve1,1n48bvt,Nobody talks about the loneliness after quitting…,_mantis,"i’m right there with you when it comes to the loneliness. six years later and it’s still there. 

i also feel like i lost my personality. everything’s boring, i find very little joy in things and have just enough motivation to scrap by. i’m dealing with some mental health issues as well, but thats nothing new. it just feels like the life’s been sucked out of me, which sucks because this is the first time ive truly wanted to live and be happy yet i feel close to nothing. 

it’s an endless cycle of being depressed because im lonely, but not having the motivation to make the effort to learn new hobbies, meet new people, etc. when i first got sober, at least people pretended to care and support me. now they’ve all moved on, while my life remains stagnant. so i can relate all to well to your feelings. it definitely should be talked about more, as well as the long term withdrawal symptoms and what to expect in general. 

adding this in here because why not, but im curious if any of you have experienced this as well. i started using when i was 14 and quit when i was 23. i dont know if its because there was a lot of trauma during that period of time but i feel like those 9 years were just a really bad dream. i feel so disconnected from that version of myself and my experiences. on top of that, my personality sorta reverted back to how i was at 14. im guessing its because the last “true” or “normal” version of myself was at that age, so my brain is just going back to what it knows. ive definitely indulged that part of me by doing or getting things i wanted at that age. i’m almost 30 now and still feel like a teenager in a way. has anyone else experienced something similar? if so, what information / theories do you have?

sorry this is so long!! but i just wanted to say that im here for anyone that needs a shoulder to cry on or just someone that listens. my pms are open. im here for you, and like op said, we’re not alone.",1,t3_1n48bvt

I spent years reminiscing about my old life, drugs, old friends and it finally went away, mostly. But now im stuck in this awkward limbo of knowing I can't or won't go back to that, knowing it would never be the same, but not yet being somebody who is in love with my new sober life. Im doing good. I have a job and money and a home and like everything is fine but also im just floating thru every day like OK, another day. Numb maybe? I don't even know. Definitely lonely.

540,msjcqeu,1i954eh,7 hydroxymitragynine made me go backwards in my recovery,PalpitationLive8985,"Yeah, I tried it for 3 weeks. Up to 8 18mg pills a day. I found that it was immediately something I liked, and that my body felt like s*** every 4 hours after dosing. At least during times of activity. Maybe some people can use this responsibly, but I certainly didn't. And I recognize that I was addicted by the third week. So I can't afford that and I went cold turkey. I did have one little corner every day for the 4 days that I was having trouble breathing without telling myself to breathe and panic attacks and my body was just all over the place like I was cracked out. It was hell to be honest. Really bad. The worst 4 days I've ever felt and I've come off quite a few things. But that was the worst. By day five, I felt good. It was a big test when I got 25 pills in the mail and had to flush them down the toilet on day three. I kept one and split it up. I think I ate one of the corners one day but I really didn't want anymore of that. I had to take a whole week off and just hide in my house. So, I didn't take it for long but I will say, powder Kratom might help with the withdrawals? At least if you have some really good powdered kratom? But that's a big question mark because it might not help at all? Maybe a shot of extract but make sure not to get addicted to the extract. In the end, powdered kratom is the way to go I think. I've been on and off it for years and I really don't think it's addictive. Unless you take a whole bunch of it. But if you just dose once or twice a day, it's not bad. I had no trouble getting off it under those circumstances. In fact, I didn't have any when I was kicking 7oh. I'm not a hardcore drug user, but I've dabbled a lot. I definitely tried meth back in the old days. I knew that stuff was trash. Coming off that was pretty wild. I wasn't addicted but I felt like a zombie a couple of days after partying in Austin. Anyway, did you get off heroin again? That's got to be really tough. I've never tried it before. I've done methadone pills and dilaudid but that's about it. How about the methadone program? I have friends that are on that. ",1,t3_1i954eh

555,mxhpmxc,1i954eh,7 hydroxymitragynine made me go backwards in my recovery,BROWN0133,"Correction, it isn't ""stronger"" than morphine or diacetyl morphine, it has a binding affinity higher than them. However this has been up for debate as well, because the cited studies compare the effects of oral morphine and sublingual 7oh, where method of administration plays a huge factor in the efficacy of the substance. With sublingual being preferred for 7oh, where as IV is preferred for morphine as the oral bioavailability is substantially lower. Binding affinity is simply the capacity for the neurotransmitters to absorb the chemical, binding affinity is the reason buprenorphine will send you into precipitated withdrawal. It is not the same as potency. 7oh is an opioid some would consider ""quasi opioid"" like tramadol. It is also only a partial agonist, so also similar to buprenorphine, has a ceiling effect.

The general speculation with this stuff and why its withdrawal can be all over the place is that Kratom contains a plethora of other alkaloids, ranging from opioid agonists and antagonists, to adrenal agonists and serotonin activity. The method of synthesis often results in what's considered a broad, or sometimes full, spectrum extract in some regards, as you'll see in lab results that 7oh isn't isolated from these other alkaloids. Often 70-80% 7oh with the remainder being broad spectrum by weight. some users report worse than traditional full agonists and others reporting cake walk withdrawal in comparison, as well as symptoms not typically associated with opioid withdrawal and instead similar to that of SSRIs and amphetamines.",1,t3_1i954eh

I was okay when I was just consuming whole leaf kratom. About 3 years in, I’m a full blown addict and it’s literally ruined my life in every way! I’m surprised I’ve not overdosed. On average I consume 4 packs of the 120mg Opia, or the 7Tabs, often ontop of 3-4 bottles of K-Fuel liquid extracts. Sometimes I do much more. Off the top of my head, I consume anywhere between 650mg-900mg every day.. The photo I’m sharing is about a month and 1/2, maybe 2 months of use. I started saving my packages for lawsuit purposes. This shit will consume you! I’ve done just about every drug and a lot of it growing up. But I’ve never become dependent or addicted. I’ve tried quitting, was even prescribed Suboxone. It worked for a bit, but due to the fear of suboxone rotting people’s teeth out, I don’t take it as prescribed.  Long story short, 7-Hydroxymitragynine is some potent shit and very addictive.

I can feel the effects it’s having on my cardiovascular system. Fucks with the blood pressure.  Mental health is destroyed.. it’s really fucked my life up in every way… It’s expensive as hell. Financially,  I’m fucked. I have to sell my home now because of how deep it took me. It’s caused me to think suicidal. People who keep playing the holier than thou drug’s they’ve done or do and comparing this stuff to street drugs are really underestimating these 7Oh.. I finally craved.. I can’t quit. I’m very weak and am checking into rehab today.

To anyone else battling this, I pray you find a way to escape this hell! It’s dark! Scary! And it’s a serious problem! Get help!!! Fight!!

This needs to be OUTLAWED. As for Kratom(WHOLE LEAF), they need to leave it be. I think it’s perfectly safe. 7Oh however is on a whole different level.

If Consumed responsibly it can really help you, it has helped me.

If you have addiction problems and feel 7oh may become a problem, then don’t take it. I’m a recovering alcoholic however I ask family to hold on too my debit credit cards and limit myself to $50 a wk, once that’s gone that’s it, cause I know that I will continue to purchase more 7oh and Kratom. 7oh has been around for a long while now and there have been a ton of articles and videos on it, if you are not sure about it look it up. Whoever said 7oh is worse then any drug out there is either jumping on the Hate wagon, is a little B**ch, and or just wants to stir the pot. For the ones who do dose it responsibly and actually need it, like myself, 7oh has helped tremendously and saved my life from eating a bullet or jumping off a bridge, yet cause I do dose responsibly, I’m not addicted. People do your homework 1st before trying anything and if you know you have addiction problems and are afraid to become addicted to it, STAY AWAY and look into something that will actually help you. I’m sorry for going off, but it’s seriously pisses me off how people overreact and or wanna fit in. 7oh is a Helluva safer and cheaper than all these pharmaceutical drugs as well as H, CC, Alcohol and every other man made drug out there. I would honestly prefer 7oh then to take pharmaceutical drugs for my pain, PTSD and Anxiety. If you take too much 7oh by itself, you are just going to pass out and wake up a few hours later or the next day, not die. Same way with Kratom, well too much Kratom by itself will cause you to puke and become make you shake. All Kratom related deaths have been from Kratom dosed with another drug, a pharmaceutical drug.

I would spend thousands of dollars a month on it the only way I ever quit was I went up to my local smoke shop who would usually front me and they were just closed and it was a new girl and she wouldn't give me any so I laid out of work for probably about a week and couldn't sleep for the first 3 days having leg cramps twitches spasms then after that you know I just was irritable for the next couple days and finally it stopped to be honest with you I might have tried some uppers to help me take my mind off of it.,1,t3_1i954eh

Most of the 7-ho that reaches your brain is from the inactive mitragynine, which gets slowly and steadilly converted to 7ho in you liver.  So kratom leave is self limiting in that way.


So doing high doses of pure 7ho is nothing like taking kratom, a very different beast.

Then stopped and took trainwreck kratom, after 3 weeks of slowly reducing the kratom, I stopped and I was fine physically, though mental health depleted the whole time bc I just wanted to be high. The self determination was the hardest part of it all.  

One thing to remember is to not take the sub longer than 2 weeks, and never take more than 2mg of it at the start for a day or 2, then keep it under 1mg.  

Best things for me was these items for withdrawals, Start low then go up daily, don't take everything at once, pick and choose what's best and available to you.

**Loperamide -** max 15mg 

**Naproxen sodium, Tylenol, Ibuprofen**  \- max 3000mg

**Gabapentin -** max 1800mg

**Clonidine** \- max .4mg

**Z-Drugs** *- Any kind of sleep medication, just be careful with some, they cause RLS to worse*

Is it possible you take it and have a nice time, and that's the end, yes. I'm not going to fearmonger and say everyone who even tries an opioid recreationally once is doomed to become an addict. But it's not worth the risk. The best estimates of addiction rates for Heroin/Strong opioids is 30%, meaning 30% who try them recreationally become addicts(the highest of any drug class). Would you cross the street without looking to get to a fun party if you had a 30% chance of getting hit by a car and being fucked for the rest of your life? But if you're deadset on trying them, split it in half, take one half, gauge the effects, and take more if you choose. If its anything like traditional opioids, you'll get a nice, happy carefree feeling with maybe a little nausea(but good nausea its weird) and you may even think opioids are really nice why do people make up such nasty stories about them and you'll get them again maybe on a weekend then again and maybe that's where it stops but maybe not. And if not, god help you. So from the guy who got hit, my sincere advice is to think back to the car analogy if crossing the road to get to a fun party is worth a 30% risk, do it up.

I got up to about 200/250 mg everyday. Tried to cut cold turkey multiple times and couldn’t bare the mental and physical pain. I was also trying to work at the time so I had to take some as needed just to function. 

I tapered down for about a week and a half. Pretty much took one less pill each day until I was down to about 50 mg. Then I just muscled through a good 7 days without it. Best thing to do for withdrawals: 
- Buy a 24 pack of Imodium (Loperamide HCI) and take 2-4 of them in the morning and afternoon. This is an opioid agonist so it helps withdrawal symptoms and any stomach and diarrhea problems you’ll have. 
- Lipsomal Vitamin C is another supplement that apparently helps flush drugs out of your system. - - Magnesium glycinate, Melatonin, and the occasional ZzzQuil helped me get some sleep during that first week. But the sleep thing took some serious time for me.

Like six kratom capsules DO NOT equal six 7-OH pills. And so people on high doses of 7-OH are consuming 3 or 4 times the amount of mitra than if they were just taking kratom. It makes a lot of sense that the withdrawal symptoms would feel a lot worse.

I consume a lot of kratom right now everyday, and I’ve considered switching to 7-OH for the simple fact that it’s just less pills I have to take orally.

Are you trying to say that 30% of folks who are prescribed codeine, or a weeks of oxy, or even people who spend months on opiates recovering from surgery become addics at a rate of 30%. Ridiculous, almost everyone will be given opoates at some point in their lives, and 95% will not have any desire to use it again. Of course, it's addictive but people need to stop blaming the drugs for that. 
What causes addiction is grief, trauma, depression, personal, tragedy, etc.  These are the people who really need to be careful with opiates. It's a side effect of mental illness, and if you're honest with yourself, you know this. This moral panick about everyone will get addicted because this drug is sooo evil.... is reductive nonsense that doesn't address the issue. Turns normal recreational users into criminals and then addicts and continues the cycle of state violence and the criminilization and neglect of marginalised communities. And it goes on and on. 
Don't spread missinformation, when people find out that they are being lied to about drugs, they stop believing in the actual dangers of a drug. It's just hysteria, after all...

Btw, you can buy plain kratom powder in bulk, then buy “Blate Papes Pouches” on Amazon, they’re rice paper pouches you can pack with like 2-3g of powder at once and swallow with water bc it gets slippery when wet. Makes taking a lot of it easier than taking separate pills for me at least. They’re also called “oblate discs” but the pouches are easier.

People who are prescribed oxy or codeine for a week dont fall under the umbrella of recreational use. That is why i specified recreational use. No, the truth is in the middle. Some chemicals are much more addictive than others. that's just a fact. But yes, peoples mindsets cooccuring mental illness and even their individual brain chemistry all play a big role. But again, some drugs are just much more habit forming. And typically the people willing to try these things recreationally have higher rates of mental illness and dissatisfaction with life. If we take the publically available numbers which is 25-30% for recreational(not prescription buying them on the street for the purpose of fun) users of strong opioids(codeine is excluded) thats still well less than half. Around a quarter to a third. The numbers for addiction as a result of using opioids as prescribed are about 3-5%. Again, this is just the number you get from google.

At my worst I can go through a gram in 2 days but now I can make a gram last 4 or 5 days thats where the self control and respect comes into play and the idea that less is more with this stuff because your tolerance will get out of control if you are not careful and if you can help it don't touch it at all. The only reason I even made my original comment on this thread is that I hate to see people in the strangle hold of getting ripped off or take stuff with nasty residual solvents in the brands sold by headshops and for certain people it can be truly helpful especially for pain or for people trying to avoid or get off harder stuff like Fety or H. This stuff NEEDS to be respected because the withdrawals can be truly awful/uncomfortable and if you are struggling to quit I highly recommend weening off by lowering your dose over a week or two then either cold turkey all together or hop on some kratom leaf and either stay on leaf if you don't want to quit kratom all together or use titration with leaf then completely stop.,1,t1_mt4oiz6

Waking up feeling a weird panicked and feeling slightly confused until I get up and dose. As well as all the usual opioid symptoms - sneezing, tearing, snot dripping, aches, restless legs, zero sleep, shakiness, too hot, too cold, sweating, anxious, no energy, no motivation. 

Occasional constipation. Occasional vomiting when it doesn’t agree with my empty stomach. Avoiding meals to get the most out of doses, loss of appetite and weight loss. 

Lack of motivation while on it, made me lazy and less likely to be motivated to go out and try new things. 

Becoming increasingly worried about running out, planning life around having it or not.

On a day where I feel like I have extra anxiety I may take more than 20mg in a day but I'm average I'm at maybe 20mg a day 4-6 days a week.

150-250 just seems ridiculous and unnecessary given that even 10mg at a time gives a nice calming buzz. 500 is overkill and you should be able to regulate to avoid that kind of tolerance imo.

I dunno, maybe those with prior opiate abuses need more but I feel like it's likely user error in feeling the need to go all out. Contrary to what people want to think, a respectively high dose of 7-Oh is not comparable to a respectively high dose of an actual opiate.

Even if it takes a week or two on the kratom powder I wouldn't be too hard on yourself.  Just experiment and take MINIMAL dose to function. And don't prolong the pain. Jump off as soon as you have a chance, obligation wise. 

Because you want some discomfort, as discomfort like that brings healing in your brain.

Get some clonidine and gabapentin from a doctor. They give them away quite freely. You can be open about you kratom use, and they are usually cool with that, or say you have restless legs and ask for at least gabapentin by name. Lie and say you've been prescribed it before and it works for you, they won't check, if you need to. It's not super controlled and is commonly prescribed. Take the least amount of these to function as well.

Know the pain is only temporary.  Start exercising as soon as you can (even before you THINK you can) to activate neuronal plasticity- which is a fancy way of saying brain healing. As well as endorphins. Reading helped alot to keep me busy  and heal my brain too.  Avoid doom scrolling the whole time.

Long hot or short cold showers will be your friend at the begining.

GABA for RLS and restless arms and body! You can take a decent amount here just google it

Clonendine to help mellow you out. Don’t exceed 0.2 mg This also relieves night sweats! 

Trazodone and seroquil to help sleep. 

Going for walks, listen to music. Your legs will ache, after the aches they will get weak and it’ll be an effort to do things.

 If they share it I have to give consent for them to do so.  But they're not going to try unless I ask them to share it in the first place.  

 Note, I was compliance auditor in healthcare for years.  Lot of people don't understand these facts. HIPAA protects you, your privacy, and your rights.  Violating HIPAA is a big deal. At the non-profit I worked, if any worker committed a HIPAA violation, they would be fired on the spot.  It brings too much negative heat from the government,.and can really mess up a healthcare facilities eligibility for different grants, it has to reimbursement from Medicare and Medicaid, etc.

Also, there is no central ""permanent medical record"" for individuals  in the USA. You control who gets to see what.  Just like doctors can't share your information with other people without your consent, neither can insurance companies.  ,

f I moved across the country, I could opt not to have my records transferred at all. Or I could opt to only have my vaccines transferred so they are on record.   Or do a piece by piece depending on what's necessary.   

Everything else I could fill them in verbally.  Then, this new doctor would be my new living medical record, while the old ones would go dormant. There's nothing nationally to connect the health records of different facilities!

I actually have a lot of health issues and see a bunch of different specialists and etc.   instead of constantly getting records sent to my primary care doctor, he usually just asked me to update here when I see him. It's easier that it is to sign a consent form every new lab, surgeon, specialist, etc. I got to. 

There ARE State health exchanges.  These are the closest thing to a permanent health record you have.  They are usually regional so doctors from around your region can go to the state healthcare exchange for your region and see what other doctors you see,. what for, your medications, etc.  This is especially useful if you are incapacitated and an emergency room doctor needs information about your health and you're not there to give it.  But again like everything else, you need to give a consent to *each* health Care facility to view these records and separately for them to contribute to the database.  You also can withdraw consent at any time.  You also could review what's in there yourself.  It might work differently in different states though...

Now the only way to do this changes  as if you are arrested for something and the police determine that getting access to your medical record is pertinsnt.   But they have to conduct an investigation to figure out who you actually see to begin with and then get records from everybody.  I guess that they can kind of construct a permanent medical record.  But they have to have probable cause to do this. 

But anyway. Thanks for your response it was very helpful.  I'll probably see it online doctor tell her the truth and get prescribed clonidine.  I don't want subs.",1,t1_mjjh8t8

I was diagnosed with UC about 6 years ago and definitely developed an addiction over the course of 3 months but never went out of my way to continue to get them illegally past what was prescribed.

5mg for someone who has never had 7oh should be plenty. Tolerance will build up relatively fast. 15-20 is where I'm currently at for a decent effect. You will not OD on 7mg. Too much might make you feel a bit sick, especially if you have it without food. As far as I'm aware, there are no recorded 7oh OD deaths. All complications that have been studied, which isn't much at this point to be honest, are due in large part to other health factors. I'm fully convinced that other people you'll find on Reddit and elsewhere that claim and/or fearmonger that 7oh is exactly like an opioid say so because it simply feels a lot like an opioid and can be highly addictive, but it's really not an opioid. Not in chemical make-up and not in side effects. As far as I know, it does not inhibit the respiratory system which from what I understand is one of the biggest concerns and contributions regarding opiate ODs.

Speaking wholly from personal experience and not as medical advice, 7mgs is completely fine. You can break it in half and go from there as well.

It's addictive, absolutely, but other than that I don't think you should be concerned about any serious side effects especially if you start small. But always keep in mind, everyone's experience will be different.",1,t1_mspebfy

It's such a shame when people adopt their own interpretation of the texts for other people -- it's all very personal, and I'm lucky enough to be in an NA group where we have a very spiritual take on things -- we have atheists, Muslims, Christians, Jews -- every religion.. and it's never been a problem. 

While I agree that using cannabis is not exactly in line with being clean, I do recognize that everyone has their own journey and that it takes some people longer than others to come to their own conclusions. The only times I've ever tried to end things was while I was on cannabis only -- and I don't have a psychotic disorder. Different substances affect people differently.

To address some of your points....

1. NA is a program about sobriety and not using other drugs to avoid other drugs. That topic is way more fit for a sub like this. Read the room ya know? You claim they could be killing someone, on the flip side, you could be too. Someone could hear that and convince themselves that just weed is cool and end up back on hard drugs... Which was literally me. I saw people on reddit saying how it works and it's great. It was awful for me and I was on pills like that. On the flip side, I know someone who isn't homeless on fent anymore but they smoke weed and it's currently working so who am I to say they shouldnt do what they want? I wouldn't go to an AA meeting and advertise that I just drink white claws now because it was really just vodka ruining my life. Same thing.

2. If you don't like specific aspects of a meeting then change it. Rally the troops, vote on it at a business meeting, and set guidelines for meetings that fit all y'alls thinking. If the group wants to avoid religious prayer being said like our father then that's up to the group. Last I checked NA doesn't make anyone do any specific religious stuff. Getting out of self is beneficial for many people. Something bigger than us can be many things. For me it's the universe. 

3. You're going around posting this to different sobriety subs trying to do what? Save people? I don't think that's gonna happen.

Peoples stories were what I loved hearing the most, but tbh people generally didn’t  bring up whether or not they still smoke weed bc for some people they really can’t do it without it leading to more, so its recommended to just stay away from everything. For me personally, I found that weed actually helped me stay away from hard drugs during the first several months. I don’t smoke anymore because I’d rather be clear headed.

The ones who want to become mods are typically the worst kind of people to have as mods. These are people so starved of real responsibility that they need to moderate to get their self worth / satisfaction, and often this means bending the rules to suit themselves, letting their ego shine through in a pathetic display. It's not about moderation - it's just about them doing what they want because they can. It's part of the reason I don't take anything on this site seriously, it's such a crappy system and you get the very worst aspects of everything on Reddit. It's so often the case that the people who should be mods already have a real life and too many important responsibilities (because ya know, natural selection & competence has put them in that position), and instead the role is given to people who want to be mods purely for all the wrong reasons & because they have no life or responsibilities (again... a signal of natural selection & competency).

Some subs you get lucky and mods are decent, others not so much and there's nothing you can do other than to just avoid the sub.",1,t3_1lhcjec

 I have many friends that were hard-core addicts and the way they stay clean is using marijauna as a maintenance drug. I fully believe in people using marijauna in a medicinal manner. I don't use it, but no shame on the ones that are absolutely trying to stay clean and they find using it, helps them not relapse. 


A lady I know was hard-core meth addict. Shooting it up. Car accident from her use, severed one of her limbs. The only reason she isn't still addicted to the shit is by support and her marijauna use. ",1,t3_1lhcjec

1006,mz6mgut,1lhcjec,PSA about Narcotics anonymous subreddit,annikatidd,"Thank you for the PSA, after a lot of religious trauma from Catholic and Mormon family members I considered myself an atheist for quite a while, although I’ve always understood why people have faith and I think whatever it takes you to get sober is miraculous in its own right, including if people turn to god(s) to get themselves better. I have recently started being more spiritual though and still trying to figure out what it means to me, but with that said I will never understand anyone who tries to act like their religion/opinion/experience is the ONLY way especially when addiction does not discriminate and we come from all walks of life, cultures, religions, mindsets etc. I’m so glad if 12 steps work for people but it was brutal for me, although I did enjoy the meetings most of the time, I benefited way more from therapy based recovery groups and that’s what I’ve stuck to once I found out what helped me the most! 

I was stone cold sober for the first four years or so of recovery and absolutely fucking miserable, my mental health was in the garbage. But then I joined an outpatient group that didn’t care about weed and recognized it as a medicine instead of saying I’m a bad person if I even think about touching it again (was a major stoner since age 14 and still considered myself one when I wasn’t smoking) so yeah I slowly introduced THC/CBD back into my life and almost 3 years later it’s been nothing but helpful to my recovery, my mental health, my chronic pain and just my life in general. I am a calmer, happier person, my migraines and awful back and neck pain are more manageable and I finally get enough sleep now that I counteract my insomnia with bedtime gummies. I don’t get stoned all day long like I did prior to my hard drug use but I take it as needed and it’s helped me so much. I enjoy life so much more. I am myself again, not a shattered woman with terrible mental health the way I used to be. I mean I’m not saying it’s just the weed but I do think it played a decent role in getting me stable after a rough road because on top of the pain management, it helped me to be more receptive to therapy, therefore helping me to grow as a person. 

Now this is just my life as someone with almost 7 years clean from heroin, and I wouldn’t change anything about it. And I would never tell somebody that just because they smoke weed doesn’t mean that their sobriety from narcotics doesn’t count, or encourage them to smoke weed if they feel it’s not the right choice for them. It’s upsetting how a specific portion of the recovery community will try to say it’s their way or the highway, not cool at all. I get why some people may never touch THC again but I feel strong in my own sobriety knowing it doesn’t lead me back to hard drugs, thank god. It’s basically the only thing that helps my chronic pain since I can never touch an opiate again, you know? But total respect to anyone who did whatever it was they had to do to make recovery stick. And I respect when they don’t try to project their methodology, religion or whatever the idea is onto others and invalidate any experiences that differ from their own. I mean the longer we’re in recovery we all should understand how personal of a journey it is for each person, there is no correct way to get your shit together and stop using! I love reading how others got clean even if it’s something I’d never want to do in that way myself, like I’m not judging. All I can think is with every new person I speak to or hear from about their journey is WOW. Recovering addicts are the strongest motherfuckers on the planet, we endure so much and we have way more empathy and resilience than a lot of people who have never truly struggled.

I may take Suboxone and hit my marijuana cart a couple times a day, but that doesn’t make me any lesser of a person in recovery than those who cold turkey quit and never touched another substance again, the same way I’m not better than anyone who chose a godly AA meeting over a therapy based program like I did. Mad respect to anyone who can do it no matter WHAT it takes, as long as they don’t try to dictate the recoveries of others. 

Anyway sending you guys here all the love and good vibes ❤️ you’re amazing!! Whatever you’ve been doing, keep it the hell up! I really like this subreddit because there is such a wealth of knowledge here and you can find out so much more from others than any medical journal that talks about addiction. we come from all over the world and it’s so interesting hearing everybody’s take.

I was filled with fear that “it was the only way” , I worked in a 12 step treatment centre also last year and the whole thing is a mess. There’s good people there In the chaos but there’s too many people with agendas outside of getting themselves better let alone anyone else and I’ve given it all a good go but now it’s time for me to follow the science and take advice from assorted professionals and pick which I wish to do. I learned a lot in the meetings etc but not all of it has been healthy or helpful and it’s time to keep moving forward without being a part of what I feel is actually part of the problem more than the solution. No I don’t want what you’ve got , and I will take the very little that has been helpful and leave the rest of the toxic organisations that it’s a relief not to be sat at listening to the same old war stories and evangelising week in week out. Good luck to everyone on their recovery and wherever you end up if it works for you then I’m happy for you but after ten years of it and very mixed results I’m having better success I how I actually feel doing counselling and using CBT with SMART book and engaging In hobbies and family and loved ones rather than the shallow relationships that are notable now by their radio silence since I stopped going to any meetings just over a year and a half ago.

1008,neguh7v,1lhcjec,PSA about Narcotics anonymous subreddit,leaoigor,"I just started NA last week, I just got back from a meeting and decided to come here to reddit to read a bit more about it. 

My main problem has always been weed, I've been smoking it everyday for the past 15 years. but last year I had a big problem with cocaine for about 8 months. I managed to get off it on my own because I saw that it could really destroy my life and my brain, but I was still smoking too much weed everyday.

Before I started going to the meetings I was trying on my own to just reduce it to 1/2 times a week and it was kind of working, but I was still having major mood swings and anxiety attacks all around.

I'm still trying to figure it out if it's the best approach for me or not. Today was my fourth meeting. I spent the whole day feeling good and not thinking about smoking, but I feel that sometimes the meetings itself are a trigger, because I don't know if talking about drugs on days you're not thinking about drugs is the best approach, I'm honestly findind it a bit triggering sometimes. Maybe I should just go when I'm not feeling too good.

At the same time it's good to hear people share their experiences, it's good to talk about your feelings with a group and the meetings I've been to have been mostly positive. It's just a place where no one judges you and you can be very open and honest, and people really embrace you whether you are using or not.

I'm an atheist but people here just say to make the group itself the higher power, no one is forcing me to believe in god, which is good.

I'm still a bit in the fence about the whole ""you are powerless against your addiction"". I get what some people are saying that this can make you feel like shit and maybe you actually need to feel that you have the power yourself to stop it, even if you need help from friends, therapy and exercise. But I also get that addiction is a kind of obsessive compulsive disorder, whether you are using drugs or not, your brain is wired that way and you can obsess about everything. You can't say to someone who has OCD that they are powerful against their condition, they literally can't help themselves.

So I don't know. I guess I'll try it for a bit still and see where it takes me, but it's been good reading about it in reddit and seeing that to a lot of people that was not the way and they managed to stay clean or have a more positive and non obsessive relation with the drug.",1,t3_1lhcjec

What happened was an original poster posted their clean time and how they were clean from all these hard drugs, but if you looked through his profile you could see that he was very active on a weed subreddit and posted pictures of his weed pens just days prior. Well that’s what another member did and when someone else asked them how they accomplished all that clean time, they called them out for using weed.

Maybe it wasn’t meant in a condescending way but I’ve seen so many well functioning, healthy recovering addicts be shunned or torn down when happy about being clean from active addiction because they’re able to manage a drink or a joint in a “normal” way. Now don’t get me wrong I would never advise someone else to use weed during recovery because not everyone can have just a couple puffs or a single drink and not feel an urge to overdo it but there’s no need to tear a person down because they don’t meet someone else’s version of clean. Caffeine and nicotine are both drugs that are highly addictive, but they’re so socially acceptable that NA doesn’t consider those not being clean so it feels like gross when people judge others when they’re drinking enough coffee to jack the tits off a horse, and chain smoking like it’s their day job.

And I totally understand why God is in there, but we’re not in the 1930s when it was assumed the vast majority of the population was religious so nobody cared but now I’ve heard the phrase “NA is great as long as you can get over the churchy stuff” that maybe we should address some of those issues.

Its easy to think that once we get through detox, everything all good and we're in the clear. This is unfortunately not the case. Where youre at is where the real work of recovery starts. We need to work though how we got to where we are, learn new coping mechanisms, build a new way of living that is sober and sustainable. Also need to stay busy in this time, because our addictions will try to trick us into thinking we can do it again. Honestly, too much unstructured free time is super dangerous. 

Working a program and engaging with the community is a great way to solve alot of the problems of early recovery. Hit some meetings and see what resonates with you.

Because most people that don’t have a plan or a goal, and just wake up every day and not work on their sobriety/recovery can sometimes relapse. Not trying to be rude at all just wanted to get your brain thinking of ways to literally change your whole life around to stay clean. (Blocking people you used with or for stuff from, deleting their phone numbers, getting new friends, and hanging out at new or different places etc. 

Some people do AA/NA or SMART Recovery online, and they’ll do like 90 meetings in 90 days. Stuff like that and setting goals helps you hold yourself accountable and makes you actually work through your recovery. 

Also, don’t forget about “PAWS”, what a lot of us deal with after getting sober (depression etc) so if you’re aware that it could happen, it may be less bad if you’re able to recognize it for what it is.

I don't want to take away from that accomplishment, but I wholeheartedly agree that it takes a hell of a lot more than ""wanting it"" to get and stay clean. I, personally, and so many others I know have desperately wanted to be sober but struggled to cope with massive obstacles, primarily trauma. Once I was educated about trauma and PTSD, I saw what a mistake it was to emphasize motivation and ""hitting bottom"" over dealing with the indescribable pain some (probably most) people suffer from that makes staying clean/sober so fucking hard. Wanting it is just the beginning. The work after that is the truly hard part.

We are all good people. Horrible things happen yet left to our own devices, we keep using. That feeling will fade with time and if you don't do something wildly different asap, my bet is you'll be dead in less than a year.

I'm not saying that to be harsh or a dick. This is life or death. You will die. I don't know you but I care about you and I don't want to see that happen.

The worst thing people do is talk to people in your situation with sugarcoated language. It's not ""good job I'm glad you see it this way now"" - that type of talk gets people killed. 

Get ya ass to rehab, go to NA, go to some kind of support group. Anything and everything you can do. Do it for the person who saved your life. So their trauma isn't for nothing. Even if you never get to say thank you. But most of all, do it for yourself!

You deserve a life where you get to experience happiness. I had trauma as a kid and I'm sober today. I know someone who had their kids head blown off in front of them and they are sober today. Rape, physical abuse, emotional trauma, etc - people are sober today who had all of those and more.

This addiction takes so many and so many of us have struggled through to quit. This is your sign that no matter what there is no turning back. It does really weigh on the mind and trying to process the situation is tuff but know you have a reason to be here your not done yet. Take it for what it’s worth and run with it.

I personally had to get myself on methadone, methadone may actually be a great option for you. It not only fills the cravings, helps with pain(for the first 6 hours) and gives a SLIGHT opioid feeling(not euphoric for those of us that were used to euphoric opioids) but more importantly it is one of the few opioids that also has an effect on serotonin levels in the brain, much like SSRI antidepressants do. I've found it is hands down the most effective opioid for depression and cravings/pain/treatment short term and long term for those of us that continue to use when we get clean. 

Please, choose life over fent...you are worth it. Think of it this way, a random person saved you that you didn't get to thank. Thank them by taking life more seriously. Thank them by getting into MMT or MAT if you'd rather take subs. Get your life back. I'm on methadone with 2 children and a wife and a job as a pharmD now.

I would see a couple of dope fiends walking fast somewhere and be like “aw man that looks fun.”

Also the decriminalizations came with tons of money in rehabilitation efforts that are of course going to depress the rates of abuse.

When you think about how common cross-addiction to process addictions (eating disorders, etc.) are to substance abuse, it really isn’t that surprising. Copping can become a ritual. So can cooking up with a spoon—I felt very strange using a spoon to heat sealing wax because it just reminded me of the hundreds of times I did the same thing with heroin (of course this was for arts and crafts purposes, but the visual of an ex junkie cooking up wax gave me a laugh. Some people want to use needles regardless of what’s in them because they get hooked on that aspect of the ritual. So your experience is not that novel if we think of it as a form of process addictions. Best of luck—try to replace the old unhealthy ways with new and healthy rituals. The average drug craving lasts ten minutes, but most of us have waited in parking lots much longer than that for dope.

I have found things I enjoy doing that naturally flood those receptors.  Exercise, nature, raging at concerts in the pit, anything creative  or that gets me to a state of bliss without drugs fits in this category.

This year, im not doing any of that shit, im going to be sober and present and thankful for it.",15,t3_1hjy5e0

Waking up in withdrawals and driving past holiday decorations to go get ripped off on fentanyl before you go steal your shitty gifts that you’re unsure if your family even wants because you haven’t talked to them much. Something about that REALLY doesn’t put you in the holiday spirit. 

Today though is my third year and so my third Christmas completely sober. As a dude who grew up drinking or drugging for 15 straight years, I had no idea how awesome this life could be. I am happier and more financially stable than I’ve ever been.

Since this is a recovery sub I’ll say that I couldn’t have done this by just putting drugs and alcohol down. I had to go to detox, take as many suggestions as I possibly could from them, and end up working a 12 step program. I also maintain that sobriety by going to meetings and working with other alcoholics/addicts. If you take suggestions from recovering alcoholics and addicts that have clean time, it will change your life!!",9,t3_1hjy5e0
1276,m3dso7k,1hjy5e0,This is the best time of year to be sober,UtopianSkyVisitor,"This is my first Christmas clean in 3 years....I have a lot of mixed emotions. We aren't financially able to do Christmas, it's just my fiancee and I. That's no big deal, maybe next year we will be in a better position. 

I became an addict some time after taking care of my mom while she was dying. There is a lot of trauma there I'm dealing with. I lost my dad many years ago so all that's left is my brother, who has some pretty serious health issues himself. He's 1600 miles away. I don't have any family left, the holidays are really hard.

I don't want to use at all, I will be celebrating 6 months clean in another 2 weeks. But this is probably the most difficult, lonely holiday season I have had. The last few years I managed by using fent, easily numb it all. Now I'm experiencing emotions that I haven't had to feel in years. I want to enjoy the holiday season, I used to love it. Always went all out with decorations and got really into it. I'm missing that Christmas magic. 

Year one is bound to be rough, it's what I tell myself. Maybe next year it won't feel like this, it will get easier. Less ache in my heart 💔 that's my hope. For now just gonna keep pushing through this year with my head down and my goals set.",3,t3_1hjy5e0

Some people reminisce on their time using and I won’t say it was all bad, especially early on. But by the last couple years it was such a vicious cycle of hell I’m so thankful to not be stuck in anymore. I literally remember calling my dealer on Christmas in the past desperately trying to trade gifts for dope and offer to let them be held as collateral. Very glad I’m not acting that way and putting the people that care about me through that during the holidays anymore.

You obviously want to live.  This post wouldn’t exist.
Also I’m not even religious or super spiritual but it’s pretty weird that you’re not dead.  That means something.

I just kept telling myself to be sick for a few days and just feel uncomfortable for a month?  Then just feel a bit imbalanced for a few months after that?

Can I really not just handle that?

1349,mr4ybmy,1kh37by,I did it . I’m finally free of all opiates .,Yohanans_zeal,Awesome on your accomplishment. I don’t hear to many on here talk about Kratom. I usually hear how it’s so great and how it has saved people from using other opiates. They don’t realize it’s still using and it is far more addicting then people want to give it credit for. I don’t know one person who kicked other opiates with Kratom and the ones I do know who use can’t stop. I was hooked for 14 years and suffered many many withdrawals and overdoses on just Kratom alone. I wouldn’t have stopped if it wasn’t for cardiac arrest and a defibrillator put in plus seizures and shocks. I’ve said it multiple times before on here. People need to know that all opiates are a major problem. If can get involved somehow and educate according to what we struggled with maybe some headway can be made to help others from otherwise avoidable situations. Great to hear your testimony.

1364,mr50owa,1kh37by,I did it . I’m finally free of all opiates .,Thracian777,"The problem is they stay on Kratom too long and abuse it . It should be used with precision and a plan .Once an addict always an addict , you are just replacing one thing with another . Anything that hits your opioid receptors isn’t good long term.

It should be used during  acute withdrawal phase while coming off the hard stuff . Sure ya can say I took the easy way out and jumped on Suboxone but at least it’s medication and not a short lasting high like Kratom  that needs to be dosed multiple times a day . 

 Kratom can fuck you up just as bad ,it wil leave you dope sick and not being able to get outa bed or shower without a dose if you use it long enough . Coming off Suboxone is nothing like Kratom ,at least in my experience . I couldn’t fucking move or function while I was on Kratom .Anyone who defends Kratom is a delusional addict who just wants to justify using it . 

It has its uses for helping people come off ,but that’s it . It should be used short term carefully. Once you get used to it you can’t function without it.",6,t1_mr4ybmy

1370,mr6k08p,1kh37by,I did it . I’m finally free of all opiates .,CryBabyVeezus,"Yeah, your dopamine receptors will heal, and you will feel happiness naturally again. Unless you have been told otherwise, then your brain will probably heal itself over time. It's different for everybody, but I think it's around 12 months to completely reset all your receptors and get things back to normal. After you get through the withdrawals, you'll start feeling way better overall. The withdrawals usually last about a week, with the first 4-5 days being pretty bad physically. Lesser symptoms will last a couple of weeks. It depends on what substance you're using, but it usually takes 12-24 hours for symptoms to come on. To ease things, there are many methods. It really just depends on what resources you have and what lengths you're willing to go to. People have different methods they have posted online with thorough instructions. Without going into a specific method, generally, what works is trying to find a medication that helps with anxiety, something that helps with the pain and muscle spasms, and something that helps with sleep. There are over the counter options for all of those things, but obviously taking a xanax and drinking chamomile tea will both calm you down, but one is way stronger. Stay super hydrated and take a multivitamin, eat when you are able to. Probably going to have to take it slow, but pepto will be your friend throughout the whole process. If you feel nauseous or get stomach pains, drink a couple of shots of pepto. And just make sure you have a few days at home where you can dissappear and sleep it off. Take care of yourself. The vitamins and hydration and eating  are just as important as the comfort meds. Suboxone is a med that could help you with cravings, I would do my own research on that part if I were you. Some people don't want to be on any medication, but for other people, it helps a ton to avoid relapse. Happiness will come with turning your life around and then finding fulfillment in it.",4,t1_mr626f7

I started getting rushes of euphoria naturally ,I started blasting music for the first time in years and singing and enjoying it . This was happening to me during the last bit of my taper .I tried to stay positive and kept telling myself I will feel better. Once I skipped a dose I was hit hard with physical withdrawal for 2-3 days  . I was given comfort meds in detox that I was saving to quit Suboxone instead  . Cholodine is the best medicine for this case and I used a muscle relaxant for three nights for sleep and I stopped(you don’t wanna stay on it too long as it affects your CNS) .  Seek medical help . The meds will help you sleep and ease the anxiety and physical tension . If you can do it cold turkey then kudos to you but when I was withdrawing from Kratom I couldn’t fucking move or sleep . It was awful , I could imagine perc is the same.  You can do it , Suboxone stays in your system and I got off this shit . Perc is in and out . You need the right meds in hand when the WDs hit . 

Start working out if you haven’t . Take hot baths followed by cold showers , go in the sun light . I did all these things to help along with eating very clean and drinking galon of water a day along with high doses of vitamin c and magnesium .If you need help with appetite cannabis sativa low dose edibles are good appetite,mood,digestive cramping and body pain . Becareful with the doses of the edibles because it can put you in an awful panic attack as you are anxious from wds . You want super low medical grade you can find . I’m talking 1-3 MG. 5-10 if you have experience with it .



First taper your perc dose .Idk how much you are taking but let’s say if you take 100 go to 80 for a few days then 60 for a week . Then take 40 for a few days ,then to 20.  Try to go as low as you can . Then to 10 mgs then to 5 . Get the smallest dose percs and cut it in half .  You will be withdrawing ,but if you stay positive during this phase it will be easy for you to give it up .During this phase if you get active (even walking or working if you can ) will help tremendously.Once you decide to come off follow the routine .Your energy levels will return slowly .",1,t1_mr626f7

If you have insurance you can get the medication that helps tremendously with the body aches,restlessness and nausea .

1404,m8a91pu,1i49boy,6 months clean off opiates today,TheSunIsAlsoMine,"Oregon is the worst. It’s where I’m currently at (long story but this should be a temporary stay at most, but I did grow up here unfortunately, came back after 14 years away and living on east coast). 

I am alone and the gloomy rainy gray weather is something I am not mentally or emotionally equipped to deal with. That’s why I end up self medicating as nothing else seems to have worked as far as therapy goes and this crippling emptiness I feel every day since I was just a young child). I know it’s not the answer and self medicating with opiates is a doomed solution, but sometimes it feels like the only way for me to want to live is with them. Even before I spiraled out of control with them (when Covid started and I just lost all my social interactions and normal work schedule that kept me somewhat stable or at least not hyper focused on feeling empty), I have always felt something gigantic is missing in me. I never felt any sort of passion towards any hobby or activity or just anything that other people enjoy and get excited for. Nothing outside of super risky behavior ever got me any sort of feeling of liveliness and even those risky adrenaline rushing things or situations I sometimes got myself in, would barely be enough and made everything feel even worse the next day (if that was  even possible). Either way I was doing dumb early 20’s things that were sort of fun, alcohol filled weekends etc etc but that phase had ended and I have no desire to drink or go clubbing these days. The only substance I’ve ever loved and stupidly worshipped (and still do I guess, from the way i talk and romanticize it) is opiates. I have this strong feeling that I was a junkie in past lives as well, and I don’t even think I believe in that reincarnation stuff. It’s weird I know. 

What you wrote really resonated with me because I feel like I can’t keep up with life and life responsibilities without them and every time I get clean I feel so fucking guilty for not being able to be a functional person instead of some depressed shell of a human, which makes me relapse and keeps the vicious cycle going. It feels like I can’t really focus on getting well and focus on recovery because life keeps being thrown at me and it’s either I do what I need to do to keep up with life or I drop everything and focus on recovery but who knows how long that will take and I’m in no position to take all that time off currently. I have never hit any sort of real rock bottom fortunately because I have an incredible support system as far as financial help goes and I know that I have a safety net to catch me if I get in real trouble, but I also have been able to somewhat keep up with life responsibilities while going back and forth between clean time and relapsing this past year and I have no real idea how to break free from the cycle because I have never lived a mentally healthy life. And now that all hell has broke loose, and I am self medicating which has been the only way I feel stable and clear enough in the head and not wishing to die, I’m just sorta here and floating, not dead, but not really alive either. Somewhere in between. And people around me don’t know for the most part. It’s my dirty shameful little secret and I don’t know how to explain to them that something is very very broken inside my brain and I question any sort of meaning in life every second of every minute every day. When I’m using though, that cloud of pointlessness and meaningless goes away and I can get myself to just do things just because I know I’m expected to do them as an adult living modern society. But this is a bandaid solution and I have been bleeding out of it for too long, the bandaid is no longer stopping the massive amount of blood gushing out and I know that if I don’t do something drastic and put something in place to replace this bandaid quick fix, I will bleed out and to death. Dramatic metaphor but that’s how I’d describe it, idk.",1,t1_m82p23f

I’m hoping with the classes in my degree plan I’m about to figure out strategies for that. 
Yep! That’s how it goes sadly. The first clinic I went to made me feel like I was just a part of an assembly line. The therapy was terrible. Very unorganized. The staff was overworked. It was pretty much “Everything going alright?”, “Okay, see you next week.” Maybe five minutes if that and I always felt rushed because there would be a line outside of others waiting just to meet their requirements to dose. The second clinic was great. We’d schedule our time and it felt like we’d talk for ages. I never felt rushed and I felt she understood me. She didn’t personally struggle with addiction but her son was an active user and that inspired her to get into the field. 
I feel if a counselor isn’t in it to truly want to help people then they should reconsider their career choice. I get burn outs but at least try to strive to be the best you can because just a little bit of compassion can go a long way.",1,t1_mn76xvy

1456,n5tbhuo,1mbptc6,My husband is 100 days clean from Opiates,Due-Violinist5278,"Kratom’s not good either. People die from taking too much of it. I’m not trying to take away what he has accomplished. But you guys are still in the first few minutes of the 1st quarter of the game. He’s lucky to have someone like you to be supportive and by his side.

If he has no interest in going cold turkey—detox, or detox and rehab—then I’d look into a short-term taper program with a doctor for bupe. Obviously, I wouldn’t condone him getting on bupe full-time. But kratom isn’t safe, and he’ll start needing more and more.

And the biggest, most important suggestion? The opiates are a symptom—they are not the problem. The disease of addiction is the problem. And it’s not going anywhere. It needs attention immediately. I am begging you to ask him to go to a 12-step program. Any. Get a sponsor. Raise his hand. Share. Take numbers.

I suggest an Al-Anon type meeting for you too, so you can learn what’s healthy and what’s enabling behavior. The circles under his eyes will be the least of what changes. It gave me a spiritual overhaul. A new lease on life. A happiness. A joy. A revitalization of all of my broken relationships.

If you want your husband to be the absolute best version of himself?

I’d look into getting to a meeting ASAP. Tell him congrats on what he’s done—but don’t stay there. My opinion is he’s gotta get away from maintenance stuff. He’s playing with fire. He can get through the discomfort and work on the spirit. If I hadn’t? I’d be dead right now after 20 years of opiate addiction.

I was a heavy hydromorphone user and two years later started messing with heroin for about five‘ish years.
At some point I couldn’t take it anymore. I’ve ruined my entire life, lost everything I had and still felt terrible all the time.
I called the clinic and had my first dose levomethadone about a week later.
Since then my life has improved so fucking much it’s unreal.
No more looking where to get the best dope for the little money you somehow had, no more getting ripped, but most importantly: no more being dopesick.

Sure, methadone has its fair share of side effects. It’s still a very powerful opioid after all.
But I would never even think of going back to my „old life“. I miss literally nothing about it.
I got a huge part of my life back, as you already mentioned.

I have ran a MAT program inside a jail for 2 years. Out of the hundreds of clients I’ve treated for OUD all have been fentanyl, all have been given Suboxone, and only 1 has gone into PW. You can absolutely use Suboxone to get off FTY. The sweet spot is 48-72 hours. Methadone is a full agonist meaning you can still get high on opiates. Out of all the methadone clients I’ve met and treated I know of 2 off the top of my head that have successfully stayed clean and gotten off the methadone. All the methadone clients that come into the jail are STILL getting high. I would take PW over methadone detox any day of the week. Methadone detox is long and excruciating. You’re also chained to a clinic everyday until you work up to take homes. Medicine has significantly advanced since methadone came out. There is a reason why Suboxone is the gold standard. Now that we have the Sublocade shot getting off Suboxone is easier than ever. Your recovery is your own so whatever works for you. But please don’t encourage people to get on Methadone over Suboxone. As someone who has worked in this field for 5 years, in addition to working with other professionals that have been around since quualudes were a thing not a single one of them support methadone… Not because it’s “stigmatized”, but because we are on the front lines so we see the people on it and there is little to no long term sobriety or they’ve been stuck on methadone for decades…",4,t3_1kp671q

Fentanyl typically has the same withdrawal window as any other agonist, it’s just so fucking strong that even a tiny bit still circulating after a few days is a ton. If you are taking pure diacetylmorphine(heroin) it’s typically 30% pure, so 4 bags is one fent 2mg pill. If some of you are taking 10-20 or even 30 a day, you are taking 30 to over 100bags a day. So even after 5 days detox day there 1/100th of prior amounts, you still have 3-4 bags in you which is stronger than any ORT. It’s all about potency man, you can’t expect anything else from such a strong agonist. 1 pill is 20-40 times what a hospital dose is for someone who got shot, so 10-20 a day is 400-800x a hospital grade dose.

MAT helps tremendously with that, but it’s not a solution for all of our problems. It’s a tool to help people get off that street dope and having some kind of consistency in their lives.
But one has to be willing to actually change, before change can happen.
I know a lot of people who just use mdone as another drug to get high on… which is ridiculous imo lol

You don’t get methadone in Germany but levomethadone. It’s basically the same, just about twice as potent.
In my clinic you have to go there each day, unless you have clean UAs for at least 3 months.
After that you can get take homes, starting from three days up to a full month.

But other than that I think it’s just pretty much the same as in the US. I’m not too familiar with the US MAT system.

I’m really not trying to insult you. I actually care about this subject. 

The disease of addiction is in your brain. It doesn’t matter what you feed it with, as long as you’re feeding it - it doesn’t go away or get better. 

Methadone is an opiate. It is one of the strongest opiates around and that’s why they use it to kick all the others - because it is stronger than all the others and takes your WD symptoms away. Immediately pretty much. 

So you have now switched, to a more powerful drug - so.. you can do the math. You’re now even more addicted to a substance, not less. 

Idk if you know anyone who has kicked a methadone habit- but the WD last about a year. They last forever. In fact I know someone who believed that their bodies won’t ever be the same because they spent too long on methadone and just .. completely fucked themselves up so badly that they won’t ever be right sober, again. They will never ever be ok, again. 

Sadly - they’re dead now… they died while trying to come down off of methadone for a HEp C treatment. 

The disease of addiction is arrested with abstinence. The part of your brain you’re numbing , is exactly the part that needs to get treatment. 

So basically - I mean if the point is to get your shit together ? Basically you’re just an addict that’s in a full blown disease of addiction but your addiction is fulfilled. 

So if your point is just to be able to maintain a high? Great. You win. Hopefully your insurance never changes. Hopefully you continue to have unfiltered access to methadone and you never need to get off of it. Because if you do ever need to get off of it? Shit is going to hit the fucking fan so hard that the ceiling will be destroyed. 

If the point is to recover from the disease of addiction? You’re missing it. You’re not free. 

You’re more trapped than ever. 

That’s all I’m saying. 

Everyone has a different point here. 

That’s ok. I’m not going to argue it. 

If you want to live the rest of your life high as kite great. Good for you. 

Some of us want to feel alive again. See colors. Experience love and pain and joy and connect with people and actually remember our lives. 


Some of us want to be free of the disease of addiction and we can’t do that while on methadone.",-1,t1_msya2vl

I have a terrible timeline in my head, sorry. 

My first time weening was a breeze. I literally weened down by 1 mg a week down to 1 mg before jumping. I was much younger then and I’m sure that helped significantly. My biggest complaint was sleep. It took a few months before my sleep schedule was back to normal. I just slept whenever I could and napped a ton. I was so anxious for that final jump that I didn’t even realize I went through the worst of it when I was at like 5mgs. Which was feeling a little achy, not great sleep without melatonin (this helped a ton!). I had several years of sobriety.

My second time was about the same but not as easy. I really rushed it at the end just wanting to be done. This wasn’t smart looking back. My sleep was also really erratic. This time I also noticed my hormones were all out of whack. This is was likely because I am much older this time around. A decade older. I used supplements to aid this and they helped a ton.

It sounds like recovery would be helpful for you. I don't know if you just didn't include it in your story but generally when we are battling addiction just stopping using doesn't solve the underlying issues. Clearly, your thinking is still leading you down the path of abusing drugs because you find life so unbearable without that warm blanket to comfort you. You don't have to live like that, but part of recovery is going to be changing how you think and also what you do (actions) so that you can live a life without drugs.

I have thoughts of relapse a few days ago bc my mom is in the CCU with some infection they can’t figure out, 2300 miles away from me and I can’t get to her. THEN something reminded me… do I want to lose my home, running water, electricity, clothes, etc…. Then do I want to lose the relationship I finally built with my adult child, lose my husband, lose my whole life… all over again (for a variety of reasons I have lost everything MULTIPLE times). That was the reminder I needed. I also have a friend, my husband and my best friend who hold me accountable if I can’t remind myself why I can’t do it. I have no fear of death… no fear of anything really anymore. I just honestly do not want to be as uncomfortable with myself, the people around me, and my surroundings as I was when I had been addicted. I don’t want to have to fight through hell to get out of again, either. There are fates worse than death… starving, eating out of dumpsters, being SAd while high and not remembering for years that it happened until it hits me randomly in therapy, the nerve damage I permanently have which could be far worse… it’s all just not worth it. Also, remember, drugs now are dirtier than they have ever been, even since 2020… hell since 2022. I keep an eye on things so I am up to date but it also reminds me why I can’t touch the shit.

As an addict, everything you buy should have a receipt. By that I mean don't get involved in the old behaviours of acquiring drugs illegitimately. I'm making a big assumption that you weren't prescribed the benzos btw.

I guess it's about avoiding behaviour. Don't buy drugs from anyone but a pharmacy. Even then, a lot of doctors hand out benzos because it's an easy fix. Who doesn't have anxiety?

I was the same as you, reluctant to go on methadone.  I spent a lot of money bc I didn't want to go on methadone.  Imagine you went on methadone 4 years ago.  Now imagine your life in 4 years and what that could look like 1 way or another.

Those pills are like the crack of opioids.  You need a dose every few hours.  Methadone is way way way easier.  The trick is, don't take more than you need.

Eventually, I found a brand new script of 10 25mch/hr gel fent patches. I’m guessing he forgot he stashed them because he definitely used.

I took it home and stared at them for a bit. Weighing my options. Thinking of using them or selling them. Before I could even think twice, I was on my way to a pharmacy a few mins away from me.

If I ever came to my room and found my lockbox open and empty, I would cry and go crazy.  I wouldn't even know how to explain it to the clinic even less so to the police, though I know it's literally considered theft, since methadone is a prescription medicine (Idk if it could bring other charges as well because of that, but if it did, I would press them) but I also know the stigma and how often methadone is sold or traded for other drugs.

1661,mlfc70s,1jrjvpa,Should I press charges against my roommate for stealing my methadone?,521bhp,"This is a difficult decision in anyway mate. I guess it kinda depends how close you both are. I know you said you’re roommates and you’ve bonded with her quite a lot, but are you “good friends” or “partners”. Or just roommates that know each other well? How did you guys become roommates? 

Either way if I was in your shoes, no matter what the relationship is, I think I’d had a good chat with her about this and tell her you are going to make a police report. Followed by explaining that you need to for your own wellbeing and due to the fact that the methadone clinic has these rules and this could really hinder your sobriety because the clinic could cut you off. I believe this would also benefit her and potentially give her a more serious wake up call. I understand her situation and the addictive mindset, which is quite sad in a way and I do feel sorry for her. Although don’t feel bad about going to the police because you’re doing all of it for YOU! 
And in answer to your question about if you should tell them who it is… I think you should tell them your roommate stole them. If you say you don’t know who did, the police and methadone clinic may think you’re potentially lying about it.  

In future, maybe keep the keys to the lock box with you at all times? Or put the lock box within another lock box and hide it. At the end of the day you’re the only one that can look out for yourself. Maybe follow this up by being there for her in her time of need if you guys are close in that way, try not to be angry and annoyed. Potentially act in a way that shows you’re disappointed about what she has done but you’ll help her if needs be.

1663,mlgjlpg,1jrjvpa,Should I press charges against my roommate for stealing my methadone?,ForsakenSignal6062,"She stole your medication and would’ve died had you not found her. In the hospital for a week… 26 rehabs already, enabling parents. 

I kinda sit in the ACAB party so I have strong feelings about pressing charges against anyone, but this girl 100% needs some sort of intervention or come to Jesus talk or SOMETHING. It really is a tough call, if people keep enabling her and letting her get away with her behavior, what incentive does she have to truly change?

It’s unfortunate but some of us have to hit pretty low rock bottoms before we’re truly ready for change. It took me burning out my veins making IV nearly impossible, which for an addict is ridiculously frustrating and sad, and then a medical scare that left me in the hospital needing constantly replaced IVs and blood draws that they struggled with daily because of my veins while I was withdrawing for a week with zero sleep. And I’ve kicked so many times over the last 15 years its not even funny, but that experience basically was my long dark night of the soul I suppose. I was nearly septic and one of my hands had stopped working and all the news they were giving me was scary. Hand might not come back, might have endocarditis. Scared me straight in a way, and took a long time for my hand to “wake up”

Something needs to happen before this girl dies. I wouldn’t know what to do myself, and I really feel for you in this position. I don’t like criminalizing addiction, but not all addicts steal, and that was your medication needed for your recovery. She would’ve left you in a fucked position. I’m sorry I really have no guidance for you, this is messy. Follow your heart on this one I suppose 

TLDR: what a mess, I’m sorry I don’t have great advice, she needs a wake up call of some sort",19,t3_1jrjvpa

Just be honest, I mean either way they’re probably going to know it’s her right? Unless maybe you have another roommate idk. But I would do it if I were you! It could potentially save her life. If it was me I would tell them you feel conflicted even saying this since you are friends but unfortunately somehow she found your keys and she got into your methadone. Maybe it would finally be a wake up call for her, having someone who is close to her reporting her for her shitty behavior. If everyone else enables her and lets her get away with horrible things you need to not do that. BECAUSE you care about her, you should do this. Because you care about yourself, that’s the most important. 

She’s not a good friend anyway tbh, that’s your medication that you need to survive like wtf. Fuck her for doing this, truly. That’s so upsetting and I’m pissed for you. If my friend did that to me, I wouldn’t be as nice as you so I commend you for being compassionate here because it was me and my suboxone I’d be pissed, like I don’t care if they’re struggling with their addiction. why wouldn’t they just ask me? Now idk how it works with methadone but I’d honestly probably gladly give a friend a strip if they needed one and then help them get on medication themselves, however if that friend decided to steal it I wouldn’t be so forgiving since I depend on that shit. 

Anyway I’m so sorry this happened - you didn’t deserve that at all. please keep us updated if you can! I know you don’t want to make things worse for her but if you don’t press charges, she may just think of you as yet another enabler she can do anything to and continue to try and take advantage of you. She needs to get the cold shoulder for a second and be reminded that her actions toward you were terrible and could’ve taken her life or, more importantly here, **she jeopardized your recovery** and this could have costed you your life too. 

Ugh. Shitty situation all around but I really hope that in the end, she understands why you had to do it - after all that’s your meds, you had to make the report so you didn’t have a choice. If she ever sobers up she should be able to get that. 

Best of luck, sending all the love your way ❤️

Edit: I agree with the person who said that due to the stigma and judgement we get as recovering addicts, if you *don’t* tell the cops who it was they might just assume you’re making it up and sold it or something.

If this was my methadone, I would absolutely lose my ever loving F’ing mind!! I know where I live. It would be really hard to replace a month supply. Because right now I have been on the program for a very long time so I get a months worth. Whoever commented about the sublacade I wonder if I could switch over and do the shot, but I am on methadone and have been on methadone for a long time. I think I would have to start detoxing from methadone. And be in full-blown withdrawal to transition over to Suboxone first before I did anything. 

But as a 12 year recovering addict, and you as a recovering addict, who has been clean for a while. You know the right thing to do is the next right thing. You need to turn her in and do the report. She has to be held accountable. You don’t want to be someone else in her life that enables her addiction. And you have to anyway for the clinic. If you wanna even think about getting a replacement. They probably have to have it by law order to replace it for you. I had my ex and the father of my kids, he stole my entire bottle of OxyContin one time. I reported him to the police got a police report and I took it to my doctor and that was the only way that I could get a replacement prescription. Of course this is when I was in my addiction and we were fighting. But yes, I was able to get a replacement prescription so I didn’t have to suffer, but I had to have a police report and I had to name the person I thought who took it. The police asked do you have a roommate a boyfriend living here? It looks like you have a male living here. So what’s his name? And I told the truth. He never gotten any trouble ironically. But I sure did get my replacement though. I know the clinic is very strict. Mine is as well. We have to document everything. Turn in all of our prescriptions etc. And if you are not gonna have your therapeutic dose, they want to know why. So yes, you definitely have to get this taken care of.

The prosecutor is the one who decides to press charges. You’d make a police report and claim the took the meds. 

Then it’s up to the DA to decide if they will prosecute or not.  Some of this is based on evidence, likely hood of success etc. 

If you file a police report you should always be honest. But charge or not to charge is out of your hands once the report it made.

It’s essentially Suboxone but administered as a subcutaneous injection rather than a pill. Instead of constant trips to the pharmacy you just go into the clinic every 2-4 weeks initially, and then gradually the dosage is reduced and you wait longer between doses. By the time I finished I think I was going 4 months between, though I purposely would wait until withdrawal crept in to make me eager to go (it hurts like a bitch for a few minutes since it reacts exothermically with fat). 

No pills means nothing to get stolen, plus that whole association of taking pills and feeling good just evaporates. You just get to live life like a normal person again. Also because it’s so long acting withdrawals take ages to kick in and even when they do it’s basically mild discomfort at worst. I was fortunate enough to both live in Canada and have a decent job in research so it didn’t cost me anything, but I believe it’s very steep if paid for privately (like $600 per shot). 

Anyway sorry for the novel, but it literally turned my life around so hopefully it can do the same for some of you. Even now 1 year after stopping Sublocade I’m happier than any other time in my adult life :) If anyone has questions about it feel free to ask!

My cousin stole 4 bottles from me during Thanksgiving (I have monthly take homes but only brought enough bottles with me to get through the holiday with my family). I put 4 bottles in my grandmother’s medicine cabinet and the other 3 I kept in my luggage because I was staying at her house for the week and never in a million years thought one of my family members would steal from me. When I checked the medicine cabinet a couple days later all 4 bottles were gone. I told my mom who then called basically everyone who had been inside my grandma’s house that week and no one would admit to it. When I said I was going to have to call the police and report the theft, my cousin finally confessed. I didn’t press charges or report to law enforcement, mainly because my mom didn’t want me “ruining Thanksgiving” and because “he’s your family.” I ended up having to reduce the rest of my doses to compensate for the 4 missing ones. His mom offered me cash to go buy more methadone off the streets but I declined, she wasn’t the one who did it so why would I accept her money? In hindsight I wish I had done something, because my cousin is 100x worse now than he was in November. Living on the streets of Seattle, homeless, addicted to fentanyl.

Most importantly, I am so impressed and happy you made that decision. I was 31-32, and I didn’t have anything near the ability to make that quality of choice (had a seizure as a result of an attempt at “self detox.” Otherwise who knows how much longer/further the *Illusion Period* would have gone). That feeling of wishing you had told them sooner is so relatable for me. 

I don’t know your age, nor anything about your family system, but regardless of those factors: just generally, having the family involved as a component boosts one’s chances of long-term recovery astronomically — one of the biggest statistical impacts. It’s a *great* decision if a person is prepared, and I’m so glad you received a positive reaction! 

How old are you, if you don’t mind me asking? Is your family deciding your course of treatment? Is this because someone is experienced in addiction treatment/addiction medicine?

I know it’s scary; I was too terrified to even attempt it for so, so long. Truthfully (and speaking generally), there will be more fear along the way. One commonality I see in people’s successful journeys is this pattern of “check points” where they must face a fear; then decide ultimately to go through it instead of attempting to go around.

1747,mc8atq6,1iluqa1,Finally told my family about my drug abuse,saulmcgill3556,"Well, thank you and likewise! Truthfully, so much of the damage of addiction and other maladaptive behaviors comes during those efforts to “find a way around.” The desire to avoid fear is natural and innate to our survival. But that’s one way addiction uses our brain — processes and instincts we to survive — against us.

Anyone who has been in active addiction for any significant period of time knows the very *special* brand of fear that addiction creates. From disrupting out entire perception of fear and “threat;” hijacking the limbic system; PTSD of withdrawal; encouraging isolation; establishing the chemical as our primary means of “safety and security;” it makes excellent insulation/ protection for that addiction. And, by the same token, a uniquely complex, seemingly impossible, hell from which to extricate oneself.

In addiction and early recovery, I didn’t fully understand these things either — not hardly! And the logical things I did understand were easily steamrolled by the aforementioned Fear Monster. As we know, addiction defies logic in many ways. I wish you all the best in your journey.

Sometimes you can get up and move about, other times you’re flopping around. Eventually, the waves of relief are longer, and waves of discomfort fewer and shorter. You start to see the light at the end of the tunnel after days 3 and 4, for me. 

You can do this. Do you have comfort meds? Adequate treatment of symptoms with comfort meds is half the battle. It truly can make a difference in your discomfort. Then there is suboxone, or the suboxone shot, which can be switched to by day 4 typically, and stop withdrawals.

Stock up on Gatorade, vitamin c, some type of anxiety meds if you can get your hands on it, and nausea medication. I also suggest using ganja through your withdrawal. It helps immensely. You can try advil or Tylenol, but it's not going to take away the pain, so it's kind of pointless and just bad for your liver. Most importantly, talk to someone about what you're about to do. Have someone on standby that can drive you to the ER if it gets unbearable. There's no shame in letting people help you. If you're in the US, I'm willing to bet you've been using xylazine, and there's not enough research to know what's happening during withdrawal.

1773,mzfooku,1libd6j,Opiate withdrawal,Fun-Benefit116,"""But it's just like a bad flu. Just get over it, it's not even that bad"".

This is why I hate when people describe opiate withdrawal as ""imagine the flu times 10"". Because most people don't even understand what the actual flu is like in the first place, since anytime anyone has literally any sickness, they say ""I probably just had the flu"", so most people today legit think the flu isn't that bad. Head colds, a cough, stomach aches, head ache, sinuses, people will attribute any sickness they have as being ""the flu"". So when they hear opiate withdrawals are like the flu but 10 times worse, they just imagine basically a really bad head cold with some fever.

Ugh it pisses me off. One of the only ways I've found to really get across to people how truly horrible extreme fent withdrawal is is when I tell them that during my worst (and last full-blown) withdrawal from fent I had legit made the plans to kill myself, written my note, and had the razor blade in my hand when my phone buzzed and my plug said they'd finally gotten some. I was literally a few minutes away from ending my life, because that would have been preferable to living through any more of that hell.",3,t1_mzcmgfu

1775,mzfpmie,1libd6j,Opiate withdrawal,Fun-Benefit116,">Fuck methadone, Suboxone and kratom. Just do it

I'm happy you were successful, but this is such a stupid thing to say. I'd be dead right now if it weren't for methadone. And that's not an exaggeration. If I'd had to go through the entirety of fent withdrawal, I would have killed myself. I know that because I'd done it and was literally minutes away from ending things. Methadone literally saved my life.

So again, good for you for successfully getting through it, but you have no clue what anyone else is feeling when they go through it. So saying ""just do it"" and ""fuck methadone and suboxone"", you just come across as an arrogant asshole, instead of a positive success story people can be happy for.",7,t1_mzbu8tg
1776,mzkrgl0,1libd6j,Opiate withdrawal,lawsandflaws1,"Yeah, but there’s just no reason to endure that pain unless you have no choice. I took anywhere from 300 MG to 1000 MG at Oxy per day for about three years and then a messed round with fetty for a few months. I paid 10,000 out-of-pocket to go to a really nice detox facility. And since it was so expensive they did not have any reason to draw out your treatment so they actually wanted people to leave totally clean, which I did.  It was still painful, but I got every comfort med and then I got on subs at 60 hours.  They kept the dose low, Two. MG, four, eight, four, two, 1,1.  

Once I got on subs, it was pretty manageable and I got valium at night since I didn’t sleep after the first night for four days .  

I do agree that methadone it’s not effective way of getting people sober. The detox I went to did not give people methadone because people end up on it for life.  And I think it’s good for people to experience the pain as a reminder, getting clean should require some type of work.",3,t1_mzbu8tg

I know it will be hard, but possible. With that said, I still remember my last withdrawal vividly. I had gone into precipitated withdrawal the previous time I tried to induce subs; I'm assuming it was because fent was starting to spread through the tar in my area so I couldn't induce to subs after 12 hours like I used to be able to. I waited about 40 hours to induce. I had been laying in bed for about 24 hours, this movie ""American Honey"" was playing. I started literally going into like a delusional, dream-like state. Every time I hear a song that was part of the soundtrack to that movie, I get a physical reaction. You know that stink that you can smell when your nose is running when you're super sick? 

After 40 hours, my wife mentioned I should probably go ahead and take the sub. We drove to the ATM at like 2 in the morning and I put in half a sub strip. In the car, I was getting intense car sickness and street lights were blurring as we drove by. I felt like I was actually going to have a seizure. I had come off of benzos a few weeks prior. I got a sense of such intense dread, there was a gnawing feeling that I was going to die, something horrible was in the air. There was a sinister, evil feeling to the world around me. My asshole was literally raw from shitting so much, I was caked in a film of sweat, I was sneezing 10 times in a row. 

I took another half of a strip when we got home from the bank and it took about 3 hours to get relief, and another day to stabilize. That was 6 years ago, I have completely changed my life since then, I started a career, bought a house this year. I don't know why I typed all of that out, that description just brought me back. I truly believed I would never have a life after dope, I was 30 or 31 and I believed I was a lost cause, I would just stay in the restaurant industry and use and hopefully die soon.

When I went w/d in the hospital (only 1 night then detox center thank god). They didn't have open beds so they put me in one of the ""nurse resting rooms"" next to the nurses station. It was a bleak stark white little room with nothing in there but a wall mounted TV, overbed table, and a leather recliner chair that easily sprung the back up if you didn't constantly keep enough pressure on the back of your head and feet. On top of that, they kept pushing me to take my first sub strip, so they put me into precipitated w/d and there was a huge air vent right above the chair that blew a/c all throughout the night, they just kept layering me with blankets fresh out of the dryer. 

Even tho my bones ached and my body/mind was so fatigued, I just wanted to walk around/move. I even liked the weight of those 5+ blankets wrapped around me while doing it for some reason, anything but squirming around in that chair. Nurses weren't having it, I was pleading to not go back in the room, that I couldn't take being in there and/or alone. No idea what it was, but they ended up injecting me a ""nerve/calming medicine"". I couldn't keep my eyes open and my anxiety reduced a little, but it didn't fully put me to sleep. It just kept me in this hellish conscious dream state for who knows how long. 

Any music that was playing on the TV began to ""control"" my restless legs and how they moved. I couldn't take it and tried finding the most mellow show I could which was little house on the prairie and turn the volume as low as I could, then the cadence/intonation of their voices started to do it too. I began to dream consciously, and it was like donkey Kong layout, with gears all over, and a bunch of little gnome people pulling on strings pushing/cranking the gears at the exact time sound would be on the TV, and id react to it. It was like a snake charmer and I didn't have the brain power or mobility to ask for help/explain what was happening, so I was forced to deal with being controlled in silence, I felt so helpless and was losing my damn mind.",7,t1_mzct48e

1808,n1x6sai,1libd6j,Opiate withdrawal,JohnnyKnodoff,"Here's what I've done in the past. I found and printed a Suboxone Film Cutting Guide. It uses the actual size of the strip, and you lay the strip on it and follow a taper schedule, slicing the strips exactly with a razor or Exacto. I have done fast tapers over a few weeks and slow tapers over a year. The longer the taper, the better. Wait to stabilize at each dose. As you lower your dose, you may feel some mild withdrawal. Wait to stabilize, stay on that dose for a week before attempting to go down again. Never make exponential decreases in dose. Keep in mind that cutting .5 mg at 8mg is far different than cutting .5 mg at 1 mg. 

If possible, plan to use vacation at work, or take 2 weeks off. I would get cheap motel rooms, or sometimes do at the house. Be honest with a doctor or the ER and say you are truly ready to quit, and you need comfort meds. Clonidine, benzos (BE CAREFUL!!!! THIS CAN START A WHOLE NEW ISSUE), large dose soluble vitamin C, Imodium, Gabapentin, etc.

If you taper EXTREMELY SLOW, you can remain functional during the taper. The jump will be the hardest part. Exercise as soon as possible to get the body producing endorphins again, even if it's just taking walks around the block.

I had better luck at home when I had enough comfort meds at my disposal. I’d only go to a detox if you can’t access any comfort meds at all or have nobody to help you through sickness or no suitable home or location to kick.

1811,mzn9t27,1libd6j,Opiate withdrawal,tiff-thatbitch,"I guess I could have explained a little better lol… I’ve dealt with addiction and abuse to all kinds of opiates since I was prescribed Roxy 30s at 18. I have been off and on methadone for these issues for over 20 years. What I was referring to was 220 mgs of methadone. I got on methadone after dealing with a fentanyl addiction in 2022, and I eventually started doing fentanyl in the evenings after dosing on methadone in the morning. Eventually all that caught up to me, and I ended up on the run for a VOP, which lead to my arrest in July of 2023. I detoxed off both methadone (220mgs daily, as well as an evening dose of fet) while I was in jail, with not a lot of meds to help. The withdrawal was bad, and left me extremely sick for a long period of time. I didn’t really even sleep for a month, aside from these little naps which often woke me with sweating and drug dreams. My sleep didn’t regulate until about 4 months in, possibly even longer. I was sentenced to prison, and was released April 1st, 2025. (Just a few months ago)

I made a decision upon my release to get a prescription for suboxone, which I take daily. As a preventative measure against me falling into another bad relationship with opiates. Methadone definitely saved my life many times, but I’m not able to work and function on that like with subs. The suboxone just fills a void for me that without opiates I feel daily. So, that is where I am now. I am prescribed 3 a day, but only take 1 and a half to 2. 

Many people will think I’m nuts for putting myself on subs without having an opiate habit, but like I said, it’s what works for me.

1812,n0giq39,1libd6j,Opiate withdrawal,DefiedGravity10,"Well for me I know the w/d was just as much mental as physical so your mental must have been the opposite of mine.

Have you ever tried doing a program? I was on and off opiates and lots of other drugs but mostly opiates for almost 20years. I would get clean sometimes for weeks or even years, tried daily bupe, methadone which was even harder to come off of and I still felt sick every day on it but the 3rd program actually worked for me.

I did a medicated detox to get off the 120mg daily dose of methadone and the fent I was smoking on top of that, 4 days they switched me onto the 30day brixadi shot. That shot stabalized my physical symptoms better than anything else I have tried and I have definitely tried kratom and all the MAT options. I also did an actual out patient program, did the counseling and a few groups a week (not na since its not really my thing). When my mental recovery felt alright I came off the shot and the w/d was barely noticable, downright nothing compared to every other thing. 

So idk if you have tried commiting to a program like that, in patient or out patient or if you have tried brixadi or sublocade but it was a serious game changer for me. I wish I could go back in time and tell myself to go sooner. It could definitely get you off the kratom in no time if that is what you want, give you the chance to sort through the mental part and get into stable recovery.

I have been forcing food down and staying hydrated to give myself the best chance of feeling the best I can while I kick this. I just know I most likely haven't hit the hardest part of the withdrawals. The hope im clinging to is I just went 4 days without subs about a week and a half ago. I gave in and bought 2 subs to feel better and made them last about 5 days. That was just prior to the 3 days clean I have now so im hoping that helps.

1816,mzcfdwx,1libd6j,Opiate withdrawal,DefiedGravity10,"The detox I did was covered by state insurance so it was free but I get what you mean, I didnt talk to anyone besides my nurse the first 48hours but when I started to feel better it was actually alright having other people around that were also going through it. 

100mg oxy isnt too bad so you will be fine, I was coming off 120mg methadone and smoking fent on top during my last detox so I was terrified. They gave me clonidine for anxiety, gabapentin for the nerve stuff (i feel electric shocks down my limbs but its also for RLS), zophran for nausea, and tramadol plus melentonin for sleep. 

If you have a dr they will likely prescribe you all that except maybe the gaba if you tell them what its for. My primary dr did when I was trying to come off the methadone myself and another time I was prescribed all of it but the gaba to come off bupe. 

If you do though I really REALLY recommend getting an at home blood pressure reader thing. I used to collect these meds (and stronger ones like benzos, subs, ambian) to try and make the at home detox easier but I would just pop them whenever, I didnt track the time or how much so I was likely taking wayyy too much and I wasn't eating or staying hydrated. Basically my bp was always too low which made all the symptoms worse and made me feel a LOT worse. The nurses wouldnt even give me meds if my bp was too low I had to drink water or try to eat first, but I swear it made the entire thing way more managable and the meds more effective.

It might be overkill but if you just wrote down the times you take something and check your bp first it might make a difference. At the very least make sure you have a case of gateraid or electolite next to your bed so you can stay hydrated. Seriously 100mg is doable, but if it is ever not doable look into the detox clinics. I put that off for years for a million reasons but I honestly wish I had gone sooner, it was a much better experience than i expected but maybe I just lucked out finding a good one.",2,t1_mzc9wpe

1821,n0ng7s5,1libd6j,Opiate withdrawal,DefiedGravity10,"A lot of people say they can't afford it but it was all completely covered by my state insurance. Like the 4days in detox and entire out patient program, the MAT treatment, the counseling, and the groups were all totally free for the entire year.

Those 4 days in detox were still horrendous full blown withdrawal, the nurses just gave me meds to manage symptoms but its not like I didnt feel them still and the brixadi shot just stabalized them a lot faster. If you are already stabalizing though that is awesome, if I hadn't been on such a high dose of methadone I would have loved to just been done with MAT back then but tapering off methadone takes months to years and the withdrawal is a lot longer too.

The thing is the brixadi stabalized me but it was the out patient program that actually helped me get into stable recovery. Having my physical w/d stable meant I could actualy focus on the mental recovery. The counseling to figure out why I used, find my triggers, process the traumas from active addiction. The groups to have support, accountability, and practice healthier coping skills. When I finally came off the brixadi I already felt really stable in recovery and those w/d were so mild I was never worried about relapse. 

MAT is a great tool to help with recovery but until I did that mental work I just kept relapsing. So even if you are past the worst of the physical w/d you should really look into out patient programs, counseling or therapy, or even aa/na if its your thing because I don't know if I would have made it to a year sober without it.... I usually relapse by then or at least think about it but once I worked through a lot of my sht and got on the meds I actually needed things feel easier and better.",1,t1_n0nd42w

It all stems from anti-harm reduction / conservative / drug war politics, basically.

But yeah, you should be able to get your methadone at the same pharmacy you get all your other medications, flu shots etc. from.  

Just like anything else, just like Suboxone!

This is how it’s done in nearly every other country.

But here, you must get it from a special licensed clinic, and where the clinics are allowed to be located is VERY politicized.  

See the term “NIMBY”

This ends up having a seriously negative effect on people who could benefit from treatment, not being able to access said treatment…I believe the number one barrier is transportation, too.

What a shock, the nearest clinic is an hour away!

I think it’s literally because the pearl clutching, tough love crowd is afraid that an addict might feel even a little bit good from a full opioid agonist like methadone. Other countries believe in science and actual treatment of addiction so they make it easier to get.

To state the obvious, it’s completely insane. Given that you can decide one day you want to quit fent and go immediately on methadone and you’re good to go.

But no, they’d rather hope that addicts can suffer through minimum 5-7 days of withdrawal symptoms just to start Suboxone. And even then sometimes people get PWD.

However when it’s time to taper off suboxone, getting insurance just for sublocade is worth it cus it makes coming off suboxone so so much easier and it’ll be cheaper than paying for it cash.

1882,mfe8ohd,1j0s1k1,Why methadone is so strictly regulated in the US,[deleted],"Hola compañero!. Español desde España aquí.

From what I’ve read, Suboxone is less regulated than methadone—you can even get a prescription online through QuickMD. The biggest issue is that you’d need to lower your methadone dose to 35 mg and then wait until you experience withdrawal symptoms (48-72 hours) before taking Suboxone for the first time. This is because Suboxone contains naloxone, an antagonist that could trigger precipitated withdrawal if there are still opioids in your body.

If you still want to switch to Suboxone, you should talk to your doctor. I don’t think they’d have any objections. Personally, when I was involved in the world of hard drugs, Suboxone helped me more than methadone. But every case is different.

I’m sorry I can’t help you more with the price, availability, etc., since I don’t live in the U.S. I hope someone else replies to you.

Having said that, I went to the Methodone clinic for awhile. These clinics treat you like shit-like you’re a criminal. They are awful. 

I hated it SO much that I relapsed on purpose for a couple of months to quit (NOT recommended!)

Then I started Suboxone back when it wasn’t covered by insurance. 

It’s covered by insurance now. I go to the doctors once a month, and pee in a cup (unsupervised like a civilized person,) and go to the pharmacy. 


Planning to get on Sublocade to taper down and quit Suboxone soon. Not because I’m having any issues with it. But because I take it with my other meds in the morning and don’t really think about it again until the next morning. I’ve gotten complacent and it’s probably time to quit after all these years?

He also told me that the whole precipitated withdrawal thing is old-fashioned, and it's easy to fix by just upping the dose. And then afterwards they would slowly taper over months or years.

i know a lot of people are afraid to take more if they have precip wd since the first dose made them so sick, but that is one of the big schools of thought.  just keep taking more strips every 15-30, minutes till you start to feel better 

with the advent of street fentanyl the new approach is microdosing the subs over the first few days to build it up slowly in your system.  this way you work your way up to a blockade dose without triggering precip.  you can also continue to use dope while building up the subs and once you get to over 8mg a day you can stop using dope.  you can taper your dope usage if you want.  for anyone interested look up the bernese method.",5,t1_n1t8t2i

Idk what someone needs to write so it gets approved. 1-2 years prior you could write anything about it and it was posted right away. That is a past now. The post must have 110% positive content about Kratom to get approved. I guess, they are trying to ""protect"" the plant by removing anything negative associated with, and the sub at the same time. 

Regarding kratom itself, imo is a great tool for tapering, as you actually lowering your tolerance while you avoid the harsh WDs of the stronger opi you want to quit, so you can have more comfortable and manageable WDs later, especially if you don't have access to your doc anymore to use it for tapering..But tapering needs lots of discipline. Long taper = smooth but long landing.

PS :  Kratom will NOT put you in PWDs (precipitated withdrawals) vs Buprenorphine.

And if being on Kratom but you want to get on bupe, *I've heard*, that waiting 24hrs since the last Kratom dose - the chances of PWDs are very low. Some claim even 12 hours is enough, provided you are in full blown WDs when you are introduced to subs.

Bupe WDs last a month vs Kratom that IME on 5th day all the physicals are gone. Relapsed back then due to extreme boredom. The cravings persisted & was nothing harsh for me but ymmv

Yes it can be addictive but it’s easier to taper and control. I don’t wake up sick or get withdrawals from it at all. Trying to compare kratom to heroin is absolutely ridiculous. It is by no means perfect but it’s better then hard drugs or mat in my opinion. I finally can live life and be the best husband and father I can be. Taking less then 10 grams a day for my torn hip labrum and ddd makes the world of difference. Less is more with kratom and the fear mongers don’t get the lives it saves.

2023,mpi07uq,1k9otje,PSA about r/kratom,Yohanans_zeal,I used Kratom for 14 years and I will say there are multiple mixed views and misinformation being spread about the substance. I have learned a lot about Kratom and the effects while using and after use. I disagree with most of the things that are being said about Kratom and how mild or safe that it is. I will say that in my experience that I had 24 years use of opiates which led me 10 years in to try Kratom. I then tried for the next 14 years to get off of that. I still feel as though some of the product is being tampered with and other ingredients added. The only way I eventually stopped was due to cardiac arrest and a defibrillator installed. I still hadn’t stopped for three more months until I ended up having seizures and shocks from my device all due to Kratom. It was hell getting off the Kratom and has taken months to recover. I have had more than I can count withdrawals in the past on high doses of pain pills and can say I rate Kratom with some of the worst withdrawals I’ve ever had. Kratom works on your cardio vascular system effecting oxygen and blood flow to the heart which can cause heart arrhythmia’s or tachycardia episodes. Medical doctors know very little about the product. It’s up to people who have gone through complications from use to spread awareness. We will see more testimony’s in the future revealing how unsafe the product can really be.,2,t3_1k9otje

But it definitely did nothing for acute wound/burn pain, or actual bone/joint/nerve pain. I've known others who were actually prescribed buprenorphine for chronic pain, but they quickly switched back to their previous meds, or went on methadone. Length of use probably has a lot to do with it as well. I think that's why there were so many overdoses after the feds cracked down on the doctors. Older people with chronic pain who were on oxycontin/morphine for a decade or more, were pushed into ""treatment"" programs (Suboxone clinics) and they did not receive relief.

I have small amounts of times where I can focus on the future but recently (this time of year) I constantly find myself reminiscing about the old days.

Tell them what you just told us.  We live in an era where we trust strangers online more than our loved ones with our most intimate secrets.

I have worked in the field since I quit heroin myself.

It's difficult for you, but you know exactly what you want and you recognize the problem.

The fear of telling them is your addiction lying to you to preserve itself.  If your family cares about you, telling them *before* you destroy your life is the best possible thing you can do for yourself.  

If you decide not to tell them, follow your instincts and make the changes you're talking about.  Doing it alone is very rarely successful.  Look into treatment, finding peers to connect with, and make new friends if your friends use.",40,t3_1h9dpyb

I ended up pulling up a website for a rehab on my laptop and asking my mom to come talk to me in my room. I just turned the laptop and showed her the screen. It took her a few to put it together but I started crying and she finally asked “is this somewhere you think you need to go?” and I just nodded. I was so scared for my dad to find out but she talked to him first and it went better then I ever expected and frankly I had no reason to be as scared as I was although I think it’s understandable. They got me help. They had an idea something was up but didn’t know what or how to help, and it sounds like your family may be in a similar situation. I’m not sure of your family dynamics, but my family also didn’t really talk about feelings or anything like that so I think that was also part of why I was so scared to say anything, and why they also didn’t say anything. I don’t think they knew what to do and they were both raised where you basically just didn’t talk about your problems, pretended like they didn’t exist, and hoped they went away. It’s hard no matter what though, but it’ll be worth it. I promise they’d rather you tell them than get a call no family wants.

Even if you just show them this post or write it down and hand them a note, email them, record yourself on your phone and send it to them in a group chat. It’s hard sometimes to get it out in person, but there’s def other ways.

ETA - also we will be here if/when you do tell them. Come back and talk to us; you’re not alone man. Even when it feels like it.

I got on suboxone and went to a therapist, then told them. There are advantages and disadvantages to telling them or not, but me not raising the alarm sooner made it easier for my brother who was struggling in silence as well, to overdose. 

Do you have a good support system? Do you think they will be helpful in your recovery? If so, then yes. Just sit them down as you feel comfortable with them. If your dad would be better spoken to on an outing and mom and sister together, etc. Just figure out a good space to connect with them and let out emotions. Prepare for anger, resentment, frustration, guilt, and heartbreak. It's just as emotional for the people who love you as it is you. That does not mean you should tolerate disrespect or weaponized guilt either, though. 

The most important thing to remember is that it doesn't mean you're a bad person. You haven't failed in life.

2162,m1cw7r5,1h9dpyb,How can I tell my parents I’m a drug addict? ,alph4bet50up,"Id start with contacting detox facilities in your area and ask about medicated detox.  Personally I ended up having my parents commit me to our county hospital because I couldn't get thru the withdrawals and got denied several detox facilities because they couldn't manage health issues I had.  You need to carry narcan with you if you don't already.  There is no easy way to tell them and no parent thinks it's their kid, you can't really be mad at them for that.  They could be trying to figure out how to ask you for all you know.  

If your parents are supportive.  Just tell them you need to come over and talk to them and it's important.  There is no magical way to say it.  If you don't want to say then write it down.  If they're ignorant be prepared to explain how dependency works.  This is going to be hard as hell either way.  

You have maintenance options or complete detox.  Both can save your life.  Suboxone doesn't fully bind to receptors like most opiates and it blocks opiates because it is essentially stickier in the receptor than other opiates like heroin etc, methadone fully binds to receptors like heroin and fentynal does but doesn't block, vivitrol is a blocker without effects like suboxone but helps cravings the same.  Bupe [suboxone or subutex] and vivitrol require a certain amount of time before you can take them so you don't get thrown into withdrawal because since they're stickier if you will, it will rip remaining opiates out of the receptors to put itself in.  Bupe is 12 to 48 hrs from last use depending on DOC and how sick you are and vivitrol is a slightly longer break of time.  I absolutely wouldn't get on methadone but that's my personal opinion.  If you do try methadone and switch to subs I'd do it early on because you have to be at 30mg or under and wait 72 hours before subs.  

If you don't want maintenance meds, that's great, try it out.  But if you can't do 100% sober off the bat, that's okay.  You can also use MAT as a stepping stone and tapering off bupe is relatively easy with the sublocade shot.  

This won't be easy but you can get thru it.

Id recommend a cognitive behavioral therapy based rehab personally.  12 step isn't for everyone and with CBT you'll learn alot of things that many 12 step based rehabs don't offer.  CBT rehabs can also offer 12 step meetings but they don't base everything around 12 step meetings. 

Hopefully some of this helps you.  When I did my medicated detox I was on 12 different pills multiple times a day.  Ultimately I ended up using again and this last time I got on bupe again.  Some medicated detox offer anxiety meds like benzos and some are non narcotic detoxes.  I personally won't do a non narcotic detox, those benzos saved me so much pain and I was prone to seizures so that played a part having me on 2 benzos and 11 other meds.

If you're able to get thru the withdrawal phase and want MAT you can try outpatient, or you cam get started and still go in to inpatient rehab after the fact as well.  So you have some options.  Also many programs are 30 day to 45 day programs, where you then have the opportunity to go into transitional housing and gain assistance thru those programs if you can't get into a 90 day if that's what you wish.

Then after that they have sober houses which personally I don't and won't mess with because it's rooted in 12 step meetings and it's a potential avenue for connections and it's all just messy at least where I live. 

Good luck, you can get thru this.  SAMSHA <-Google that and it can help with rehab info and info on detox facilities.",1,t3_1h9dpyb

2165,m12auod,1h9dpyb,How can I tell my parents I’m a drug addict? ,SpicyHabarnero,"Wait I am confused, you take oxycodone 3–4 times a week? As in, the other days you are in withdrawals & take kratom to keep alright?

I applaud you for being so wholesome about your outlook. But I don't know how serious your addiction is if you are able to go 3–4 days a week with oxycodone and still function. I admit though your dosage and duration would certainly lead me to think that you would have formed a physical addiction long ago... My point is, most folks cannot go 3–4 days a week without oxycodone and still function. Sure, kratom is good stuff and I highly recommend it, but it's not 100% completely... nothing is.

IDK this just doesn't make a lot of sense to me. Explain what your days without oxycodone are like. Lastly, there is nothing wrong with taking kratom every day. For myself, I can tell you it's not addicting. At all. Not possible. I took 30g-40g every day for at least 2–3 months straight. That is a fuck ton. I ran out one day because shop closed and next morning I had to work early and no time to re up. I felt 100% okay. I thought to myself, ""huh it would, be nice to have some kratom right now."" Then I went about my day. That was the extent of the dependency that Kratom left me with. I know many others say they were left with all sorts of classic opiate withdrawal symptoms... I have my doubts. I think a large part of it is in their heads. Or they were previously actually addicted to real opiates, used kratom to get off and never stopped taking kratom, and now that has some mechanism leading to them still having WDs...  I cannot say.

Lastly, though people are going to not like this, I regret ever telling any of my family about my addictions. I didn't simply break clean from them, and it caused much anguish, embarrassment, and in the end it didn't help me to have their support in the long term. I still relapsed, and we ended up incredibly distant as compared to before. I regret telling them 100%. Also, my mom has a big fat fucking mouth and likes to tell everyone in the world what I have done, and now I get looked at much differently - and I explicitly told her to shut the fuck up about this, but she couldn't help it.

I was naturally skinny to begin with but I def got the “you don’t look right”, “you look like you lost weight”, and asked if I was sick often because while I technically lived at home then, I was very rarely there at that point. And I noticed the quick side eye or a flash of concern over one of their faces on occasion when I’d deny it, but that was it. On the flip side, if he does know and has known this whole time, when you come clean it’ll likely go easier and be a relief for *both* of you. Again, idk your family dynamics, I personally don’t blame my parents for not saying more then they did but I could imagine some cases where kids might be upset/hurt/angry/feel whatever type of way if they found out their parents knew and never tried to intervene, and that’s valid too. You know your family best. Once I spoke up they *really* kicked it into gear though, especially my dad, he was amazing. Actually ended up being the catalyst that changed some family dynamics for the better 🤷🏻‍♀️


Just try to remember they might not know what to say just like you don’t know what to say, especially if they’ve never dealt with it in any aspect before. And that doesn’t mean they don’t care or love you. It’s hard on both sides and also because ultimately it has to be the addict that’s ready, even if they spoke up. Going with the theory your dad knows what’s up, maybe he’s scared you’d run and they wouldn’t know where you were, a family fight could cause you to use and potentially OD, maybe he just has no idea what to do or where to start or doesn’t understand addiction that well, there’s so many reasons I’ve heard over the years but those are the most common when I’ve heard families talk about signs they noticed and why they didn’t speak up. Being stuck in denial is also a really common one, some parents convince themselves it has to be anything else because no way, not *your* kid.",3,t1_m15n3xy

I have seen these Subreddits and I just cannot understand it. Perhaps it's because many people are using it to get off of opiates to begin with? Then from some sort of mechanism they experience WD symptoms because of this? IDK.

Kratom is not for my person in the least bit addictive whatsoever. However, there are many people who will claim to go through classic opiate withdrawals upon cessation. I cannot fathom how this is possible, but it may have to do with them being previously dependent & addicted to actual opiates previous and having used kratom to get off of the opiates leaves them, through some unknown mechanism, experiencing actual real life withdrawal symptoms when cessation of kratom takes place.

For those who, like myself, took kratom in the first place just to enjoy its effects not to overcome opiate WD symptoms... I cannot relate or understand how they became dependent & addicted to kratom. I am not saying it's all make believe - clearly there are some folks who somehow probably experience relatively mild WD symptoms. 

Myself it is 100% guaranteed not possible to become addicted to kratom. If this upsets you that I am being honest or that you dislike my opinion tough shit. But I will not be a part of the bandwagon that go around scaring people from taking kratom because some folks have claimed to become addicted to it.

I am not trying to minimize your situation, not in anyway. Certainly you have a pscyhological addiction, full stop. And a physical one, which is largely mitigated from the kratom. It is obvious to me Kratom isn't the issue, its the oxy. Unless you are saying that kratom is able to get you by on the days you dont take oxy and there blame the kratom for being able to take the oxy..... which seems like backwards logic, but I get it.

Also, what I meant was that without the kratom ever coming into my life, I probably would’ve quit a while ago because eventually, being forced to withdrawal on a regular basis, would’ve forced me to quit. I started Kratom under the false assumption that it wasn’t physically addictive or even mentally but I was wrong. It helped me through withdrawal but overall, not really. It’s more about the high for me and feeling completely at ease when I use oxy that keeps me coming back rather than the fear of withdrawal because kratom doesn’t quite hit the spot.

I am not immune to addiction either, not by a long shot. I'll say it again, for my person it is impossible to become dependent or addicted to kratom in any significant way either psychologically but especially not physically. I am not discounting other peoples struggle... at least not completely. I definitely craved having some kratom on me because it felt good. But if I didn't have it, as I described in my above post, I felt normal. Not bad, not anxious, not cold/hot w/gooseflesh.... none of it. 

And let me tell you, doing 40g a day of kratom everyday for 3 months is an incredibly high dosage. Some days might have gone all the way up to 50g. But no less than 30g. Eventually you will begin to get queasy and once at this point do yourself a favor and just do not redose for many hours because if you do... well, you'll lose all your stomach contents and won't be able to keep anything down for several hours after that too.

What helped me was realizing I wasn’t just breaking up with a drug — I was breaking up with the version of myself that thought I needed it to feel alive. That’s the real grieving process.

The cravings don’t mean you’re weak, they just mean your brain remembers the rush. The win is reminding yourself that the rush never came free — it always cashed out in pain.

Recovery’s not about pretending you don’t miss it. It’s about choosing yourself over the manipulation every damn day",3,t3_1nf4cjc

I did at first for sure, but when you’re sick & tired of it. You’re sick & fucking tired of it. I don’t miss getting ripped off, getting told “I’ll be there in 10 min” and it could be 2-3 hours while going though withdrawals. Sometimes they were out, didn’t answer, or you didn’t have money. Probably steal, lie, or sell my personal items to get money. Lost my 2017 Infiniti Q50 while still owing $9,700 on it. Lost my job. Ughhh…

My sobriety means so much to me. I really got sober when I OD twice in 1 week 😢 and had never OD in the past 3 years I had been doing fent and boy. Was always safe and did small bumps. This stuff was WAYYY too strong. Strong enough to get my dumbass to do it again *tsk*

At 6 days you've gotta be past the worst of the acute withdrawals, which means every day, every hour, every minute you are starting to feel just a little better. You've just got to handle the mental aspect now. I know it might sound silly, but hot baths are fucking amazing at this point of withdrawal. If you don't have a bath, sitting under a hot shower is great too.

Just remember you've gotten past the most painful part already. And the depression and shittiness *WILL* go away. You're brain is gonna be a complete fucking asshole though and it's gonna lie to you and tell you this shitty feeling will last forever, and it's gonna make up excuses to convince you to use again, and it's gonna do everything in its power to convince you things will never get better unless you relapse.

The timeline can suck and depends on a lot of different stuff. I bet by summer you'll be feeling better though. Probably well before summer officially starts. 

To not ""waste time"" as you say ... in fact if you can, each day, get washed up and keep your living space clean, get some exercise and stick to healthy eating habits you're ahead of the game. (Remember that a non insignificant percentage of people - who are not encumbered with paws and trying to keep what is probably the most addictive substance known to man out of their bodies - can't manage to do hygiene, tidiness, get exercise and eat reasonably good foods according to a healthy schedule every day.) If you're sober and taking care of your body and mind as best you can you're not wasting time. 

I realize this is probably not what you are hoping to hear but I hope you can force yourself to just do your best each day. Meanwhile your body is still doing a lot of recovering behind the scenes. 

I would think it's worth going to the doctor to get bloodwork and see what the doc says about testosterone. You might want to get the bloodwork a couple times before you start any test supplementation to see if your numbers are coming up by themselves as may be expected or still staying really low if in fact they are low (they probably are, but get the bloodwork and see). Doctor will obviously have more info on what's normal for a dude your age etc.

Dopamine seems to be more about goals than pleasure. If you set a goal and achieve it there will be some dopaminergic activity going on and it will feel rewarding to have achieved the goal. Say your goal is to do hygiene activities every day. You could make a chart and give yourself a sticker each time you do something you're supposed to, like a little kid. I try talk to myself in my head gently like a baby ""come on it's time to get up! oh isn't it nice to have clean hair and teeth! Good job!"" It does not always work but it sorta helps. 

It's good to work on being comfortable bothersome feelings like boredom but also perhaps your brain needs some stuff to do. I like literature, reportage and literary periodicals like Harper's, the New Yorker etc., and crossword puzzles personally. I find reading a physical book or magazine feels better for my brain than reading on a device. During paws it may be hard to concentrate but don't give up it comes in waves and gets easier as time goes on. Like each week it should get a bit easier but something new will seem to pop up or recur like for example suddenly being really irritable, and then that will get easier, then trouble with focus pops up, and that will get easier and so on. 

Perhaps you would benefit from putting your daydreams into a journal and taking actionable steps to making some of them come true? Idk. The daily check in post can be helpful to respond to here also... people will read and support you each day and that connection can be nice. 

Much love man",6,t3_1j9jnde

You are on a good start and on your way to a new you. Unfortunately this is a mental and physical battle. Time is the only thing that heals the situation we put upon our selves. Undoing the damage is easier said than dealing with it. The new way you have to function is less than desirable but pushing through the uncomfortable is pretty much the only option at this point. It does take around 2-3 months to really start to feel the changes and even so can be kind of up and down. Each day does get better as long as you put the work in and make yourself go beyond the way you feel. Eating, drinking plenty of water, chocolate, hot showers, adequate sleep(not always so easy) and most importantly moving ,preferably exercise does move it along faster. I would recommend microdosing mushrooms but you are far enough along that other substances could become an issue ,but can be beneficial for mental anguish.

I KNOW it’s ass to perform any degree of the most basic self maintenance while feeling how you feel. Do not worry if your living space is a mess. The mess will be there for you when you’re ready to bother with it.

I always try to remember, standing(just standing) in the warm shower water to merely let it cover my head and body, is still 1 step above doing nothing. When washing is too much, just stand in it. Turn it into a 5 minute meditation sesh where you’re imagining all the yuck you’re going through, just rinsing down the drain. Afterwards, a rigorous toweling off of those *important* areas, a fresh layer of deodorant, and putting on some clean clothes that may even be wrinkled to hell from sitting in the basket for weeks, are all a mixture of magic that can make you feel brand new.

Grapes, bananas, whole wheat crackers of some kind, cheese cubes, go-gurt… you can be lazy and still shovel something nutritious into your mouth. Throw a multi vitamin in the mix.

So many doctors and psychiatrists deny that PAWS is a real thing. Even MY psychiatrist doesn’t believe it’s real… but fuuuuuuck…. I still don’t feel right, still lack energy… 

It’s real. 

I was smoking a gram of pure fentanyl a day though. And my habit was over a decade. So you will return to normal much quicker.

The best pieces of advice I can give you is to

1. Be around your friends. Go on hikes or go bowling or something. The isolation only increases the misery.

2. Get a really good multivitamin, and talk to your doctor about putting you on something to help… maybe some relief release Ritalin? I know, it’s not the best drug, but it might give you the energy you need to get yourself up and out. But NO OPIATES. ESPECIALLY SUBOXONE. That drug will kill who you truly are and make you hollow and vapid.

3. Sweat sweat sweat. Get your fuckin’ endorphins pumping. I hate the pharmacology of this country, but the best advice they can contribute is that exercise will help restore your endorphins to normal. Run around the block once a day. If you don’t feel like doing that, do squats in your room. 4 sets of how old you are. If you’re 20, do 20 squats, rest, then 20 more. 4 times.

4. When I was on opiates, I never drank coffee… if you are the same, coffee will help a lot.

If anyone ever asks you if you want to do something that you KNOW coincides with the above, force yourself to say yes. You have to just fucking do it. Stay away from booze if you can, see if your doctor will prescribe gabapentin for anxiety and stress, and perhaps a low dose of Valium.

Valium is not something that I’ve ever particularly enjoyed, but I’ve been on and off of it pretty easily over the years. 

A word of warning:
If you like the feeling of Valium …? STOP immediately. I take it and don’t enjoy it at all. It’s not bad or good for me, it just helps with my anxiety. It doesn’t have the same effect that drove me to waste away my money on pills then heroin then finally fentanyl.

You’ve gotta rid yourself of these ugly crutches you’re dealing with. Anything that is a short term solution will fail for you.

You have to fight like you’ve never fought before. Fight to be yourself again. Fight the demon inside you, or better yet? Ignore the little fucker. He doesn’t own you. You are who you choose to be.

Now with all that scary shit out of the way, I’d say give it a couple months for the PAWS to go away. I know that seems endless, but I was told by a former addict that due to the immensity of my habit my PAWS wouldn’t subside for possibly two years.

I feel at about 69% right now. Not a joke, just not quite feeling 70 yet. If you were smoking a gram of pure fentanyl a day, I’d be concerned for your next few years, but if you listen to me, as someone with serious experience, I promise you, fight to take your life back.

FUCKING FIGHT!!

Using turned annoying and distracting cravings back up to one thousand. Yes it felt pretty good for a short time I guess but the suffering has far outlasted the feeling good portion. 

I am glad you're on the vivitrol that gives you some protection from overdosing or turning the monster back on. 

Do consider how far you have come - 165 days is a long time and a great achievement. Call somebody talk about this stuff including cravings get some help from the other recovery people if needed they will help with this because they get it and it will ultimately feel better to throw the thing away than to use it. 

There is an unreasonable amount of pain with this stuff it is brutal and unfair please save yourself.

2472,myk0hwv,1lex558,Can I still build a great life after getting clean from meth and oxy at 32 years old?,toomuchsoysauce,"That sucks to have a sister like that but all the more reason to prove her wrong! Thing to remember is don't get clean and become successful for anyone other than yourself. 

Success is and will always be a moving benchmark depending on where you are in life. It's something you can't necessarily identify comparing yourself with others or listening what others think success is. Some people think having a high paying job is success but once they get it, they realize it's not fulfilling or you have to make too many sacrifices (like time spent with loved ones). Not to mention most people have fallen ass-backwards into lucrative careers because of who they know or the many advantages they were born into.

Your best bet is to simply identify what might make you happy in the next 5-10 years or so and work to achieve it. Is it going back to school? Is it finding someone to spend the rest of your life with? Is it traveling the world? Or maybe it's just staying sober and spending quality time with friends and family. Whatever it is, work on improving yourself and learning what it takes to achieve those things without burning yourself out or falling back into bad habits. 

Therapy is always a good place to start to learn more about what drives you, makes you happy, and how to avoid misconstruing short-term happiness like drug use with goals. Just know that getting and staying sober is quite possibly one of the hardest things for humans to do in this day and age so don't let anyone, regardless of much you love them or they mean to you, tell you otherwise. They likely haven't had to deal with half the shit you have. It will make finding what success means to you and obtaining it all the sweeter.",2,t3_1lex558

I made some money on the stock market, not a whole lot but enough where it makes me a decent amount every year but I still have to work to meet a budget.  But I dont need to make a ton of money. Addiction actually helps with this since you get taught that most of what people spend money on isn't necessary. It's nice, but not necessary. 

So I get to do whatever I want during the days and at night I get to go do a job i really enjoy doing and I choose it. Plus, it's really fun. It's also part-time. And I don't have a boss.

I have a wife who's a former addict who also does a job she loves. She's slso has to work full-time. That's only because she fell back into using when she only worked part-time. She likes and is treated well at the full-time job.

Is it successful life in the conventional sense? No, but I have what everyone wants. And that is the ability to choose what I do on a daily basis. Its what people work their whole lives for. And I have it now.

 Well it’s day 30-31 but who’s counting eh, lol I feel so happy, theirs is absolutely no depression witch is very strange to me. It’s like the opposite happened. I feel 28 again. Nobody really understands how the brain works. It’s still a big mystery to science although they can see the brain and tell you things with an mri or cat scan. And how neurons grow. But it’s how they remember one another after years of being wired for drugs. They grow very slowly. Reaching out touching each other like hey buddy I remember you. I know deep down I got’er beat. Mild symptoms still, sneezing muscle cramps in the morning. But I’ve been walking about 2 miles a day to the little park in town to talk to my old buddies still struggling with addiction. The few that are left. Most of the young lads are taking shitty meth. Glad I wasn’t around for that. It’s done way more harm than Pharma did back in the late 90,s early 2000’s. I feel for those young ones and anyone putting that shit in their body. But the fent dealers are getting big time in jail now. Government is cracking down hard on those guys. And they are working on a Mat drug for meth, which I don’t know how that will work. It would have to be pharmaceutical meth. Clean government made. Kinda how methadone and Suboxone work but meth is a very different drug that I don’t understand. Anyway just wanted to let everyone know I’m doing great. There will be no relapsing for me this time. Good luck out there people and keep a close eye on your loved ones. Don’t judge when they fall or fail, you’ll always have a helping hand here. On to bigger and better things.

But I was very afraid to get cross addicted. Never happened when taken right but at massive doses. Takes all the symptoms away and gives you a break. And you don’t get high when taken at max anxiety. Might not work for everyone but it did for me. I could’ve did it without but he was totally against me doing it that way. Like I said I just decided enough was enough.

Good luck, it can be done.",2,t1_mtyz4i5
2614,mu2esz4,1kt3fzy,Just cold turkey Suboxone 8mg,Bobro__74,"This could be pretty long but I’ll try to explain it the best I can. When your on strong opiates like methadone or any strong pain med long enough it slowly changes the wiring in the brain. Neurons make different paths. They stop communicating with the ones they recognize and wire to just have that drug. You stop caring about just about everything. And you don’t realize it till you do your first withdrawal and thing holy shit I can smell flowers. How come I didn’t notice that. And it’s like super human smell. That will eventually come back to normal. Taste things again. And so many other things it takes from you without realizing it. Almost everyone relapses the first time. It’s a very difficult thing to do. First time was pills. Had to go to jail for 14 months. Once I was able to sleep again I began having the same dream. Chasing the drug, getting it, then wake up on a sweat just before I got it into me. Did that for a whole year. Kept me addicted when I thought I had it beat. Guy I was bunked with knew my release date, he was a drug dealer. The day I was released I walk to Tim’s to get a coffee and wait for the bus. Guess who was standing outside Tim’s. Yup, him with a pocket full of dillies, I knew as soon as I seen him I was buying some. I could not fight it. So when I finally started methadone it rewired again but differently. It stops that constant craving because it doesn’t have to worry about being sick every day. Then you can try weaning very slowly. I was at 160mg for 7 years then one mg a week ween. Took 3 years. Jump to Suboxone but went through a methadone withdrawal anyway because of the way subs work. They only take up half the receptors and kick out the methadone molecules. So fast forward about 7 years I started a ween off subs very slowly. 3 years later I’m at 2 mg. But I work hard and would metabolize it to fast and be sick by noon. Then have to wait till the next morning to get better for a few hours. So I said fuck this, put me back to 8mg. Then 28 days ago I woke up and looked in the mirror and said I’m sick of this. It’s either you or me, punch and kick all you want and it did, it wasn’t me looking back at me. Sounds weird I know. But once I made up my mind that was it. You just have to want to smell flowers bad enough. I’ll never take another opaiate again as long as I live. I don’t care if I break my neck. I’ll refuse all pain meds. Just totally fed up, took 20 years of my life. Now I’m already reconnecting with the few friends I have left that survived this OxyContin racket. Because that’s what got everyone hook in my small east coast town. We have 7 doctors that prescribe both those drugs. Now sublicade is helping some get off these drugs. I refused it. Out of about 1500-2000 ppl that got hooked most are still taking it. I can speak about it all day but that enough for today. Hope o explained it well enough to understand it. And if you’re struggling there is hope. Educate yourself about it, make up your mind and just do it. Don’t wait till you’re 51 like me. Your brain will remember the neurons it recognizes once they meet again. And rewire back to yourself. They’ll find each other eventually but you have to be patient because they grow slowly, there are vids on YouTube of neurons reaching out and touching each other to see if they know one another. Interesting to watch.",1,t1_mu0e2ey

2616,mu43nae,1kt3fzy,Just cold turkey Suboxone 8mg,Bobro__74,"I was offered sublocade in 18, didn’t have coverage, first shot is $6000 for the 300 then $2000 for the 100. I didn’t want to trade one for the other. Got 27-28 days and I feel alright. Still sneezing a couple times a day, nose is a bit runny. But I’m sleeping 4-5 hours a night and small naps during the day. My appetite is back, beginning to taste good again. My sense of smell is returning. My sec drive is sky rocketing. Wife loves that. Can’t get enough. Went from clonazapam 2’a a couple times a day. Down yo .5 couple times a day and I’ve been prescribed zoplicone 7.5 two a night for 20years. Couldn’t sleep without those. Other than that I’m fine. No depression yet. And I feel happy actually. Maybe because deep down I know I have it beat. Relapsed too many times to count. I’m just so done with it. But I’m not naive enough to know it’s not possible. There’s always stress in life. But I feel like I can take on the world now. I think I’m through the worst of it. Taking magnesium and thyroid pills. Got high blood pressure still but not that high. Just border line. I’m gonna be ok. But like I said everyone is different. But it is possible if you want to live again. It really is like selling your soul to the devil for being numb to the ppl you love and care about. I want to feel again, cry again, smell and taste again. I could go on and on about what it takes from you. Methadone is even worse. First time I weened from that o couldn’t stand the smell of ketchup and jergens hand cream that my girlfriend used. It’s like having super human smell. Not the same with Suboxone. No RLS at all. I’m just so happy deep down knowing I got myself through it on a hotel room alone. Only way. Back on 2003-4 o went to detox 6 times. Was hard on pills. Was caught selling them. My case set a precedent in Canada because of certain details that are available online if you know where to look. They used 28 case laws and was a 58 page report. Made the front page of every paper in my province. Might post it here sometime with redactions of course. Something like the movie cherry on apple. I’ve been through it all, plus I landed my dream job 14 years ago. Can’t wait to get back to it. Best advise I can give to all the ppl struggling out there is it’s possible if you want it bad enough. Good luck to all you tough fuckers that did it, I’ll be on that list too. Still have a long way to go. It’s a long process. But I would recommend sublicade if you want to ween slowly.

Subs will kick out half the Methadone from the receptors. Go slow. Actually you could do the jump now, I did it at 40/mg. Methadone is the worse drug because it’s so powerful. Nothing gets in. Not even herion. But they won’t give it to you till around 3-4 days off methadone and start you on a small dose so the noxalone doesn’t throw you into withdrawal. Good luck

It was 2-3 years of fent. 10 total years of addiction. 

We got clean 3 years ago next month. It was super hard and I was super against MAT also. So we used kratom to fight the withdrawals. 

We were literally in the same boat as you. Broke as fuck. Couldn’t afford to get high really. I was just constantly bouncing back and forth between feeling sick and feeling kind of ok. It was truely hell. I kept thinking I’d rather be dead. But I was also terrified of losing her. Every night I’d think she was going to die in her sleep.

The cops arrested one of my guys. Started sniffing around and following me a little bit. I got freaked out and it was time to be done. 

I can’t say we don’t still miss it sometimes but we are genuinely way happier without it. Life’s not that different. We’ve had some tragedies during that time lost jobs. Lost my mom also but we’re staying strong and staying clean. 

I think you know it’s time to get clean man. There’s nothing fun about fent. The party has been over for a long time. The good ole days don’t exist anymore. And maybe someday things will change but right now you definitely don’t wanna be playing that game.

The biggest problem with rehabs or detox is that they send you right back out into the environment you left from. And, let's be honest, no one feels good after a detox or rehab. We are weak after and then put back into the same environment which usually leads back to using. 

With Methadone, you can't get high(usually) and your receptors are covered. So even if you stay i the same environment, you won't have the same temptation. This allows you to slowly move away from the people and things holding you down. 

Everyone wants to be done now but that rarely works with opioids. Usually it takes time.",9,t3_1koyrsd
2670,mstyd3v,1koyrsd,Tired of this prison.,trixiepixie1921,"I’ve been here several times friend. I always went to a detox where they used a methadone taper. It sucked anyway and it gets worse every time. Then when I get out and I’m 3 days off the methadone, I usually get on subs. That’s kept me clean for long stints. But hold onto your teeth because I need 4 of mine pulled and I’m just finding out it’s due to long term suboxone use. 

It took me about 5 weeks every time to start sleeping again and feeling any semblance of normal. You’d think I’d never wanna go thru that again right? But I’ve done it at least 3 times. I think after losing my best friend to an overdose (I know she didn’t know what was in that bag, she was getting kicked off the methadone program and was sick) which sent me into a tail spin where I overdosed myself a few times …. I’m scared shit of powder drugs. All street drugs. Pressed pills. I bought a few Xanax a few weeks ago bc they help me but guess what ? Fake. I don’t remember the drive home except lines on the road whizzing by my head. I had like 5 or 6 pills and I was completely fucked up 24/7 for like a whole week. It’s a fucking miracle that I didn’t hurt anyone and I didn’t die. 

I can’t let go of that fear. It took me so long to get, and it’s a real fear, that we should all have. Insane I have to lose the person I’m closest to, die several times myself, and I’m still dreaming about using. What?!? It’s a battle every day. 

I wish you luck. I’d say go to medical detox. I was NOT ONE TIME able to kick at home. Especially with kids, ain’t no way. You gotta think of them too, keep them in the foreground of your mind. It is very easy to lose sight. At one point after my first od I thought maybe they’d be better without me. I know that’s not true now. I just wish we could get this demon off our backs.",7,t3_1koyrsd
2671,msu48ki,1koyrsd,Tired of this prison.,seeyatomolly,"My advice because it’s the only thing that worked for me in 15 years of using is to go to a medical detox, tell them your goal is to go on sublocade and they should get you onto suboxone (you might have to go into precipitated WD for a short time, I did. In my memory it only lasted a couple hours and I just gritted my teeth and pushed through it because after 15 years I was finally DONE, also in my mind going through a couple hours of precips was not as bad as going through days of withdrawal.) they release you with a bit of suboxone then you get to a sub dr that also does sublocade and they’ll get you another suboxone script to hold you over until you get your first shot (they have to test your blood and make sure your liver is ok first so it takes a bit to get that first sublocade appointment) I think I was out of treatment and on sub strips for 2 weeks before I got the first sublocade shot. Definitely go to a treatment center that takes people on suboxone. Do not go straight home after detox if you can help it. The more time you have before you go back the better. Honestly I know you have kids but it’s probably not best for you to go back and live where you are, look into transitional housing. I know it’s probably not feasible for you but look into it at least. You can do this. I’m now over a year post sublocade and clean. I’m telling you if I can do it so can you.

If you do not like the idea of Suboxone or methadone which I don't either because Suboxone is the worst withdrawal I have ever experienced in my entire life then I suggest trying out kratom. It's got its own issues but you don't hear of people dropping dead from taking too much kratom you usually just puke it right back up but it is addicting and it's not the easiest to get off of but it's a stepping stone to help you get off of that crap if you don't want to do Suboxone or methadone. You are absolutely going to have to get away from your ex-wife. You are doing more damage to your children by staying with her than you would if you left.

2679,msuzoo2,1koyrsd,Tired of this prison.,Inevitable_Orchid338,"I lost my boyfriend of 12 years to a fentanyl overdose in February, and he didn’t even use fentanyl. His drug of choice was meth, but it turns out his meth was cut with a lethal dose of fentanyl. I found out that this is actually called drug-induced homicide, not just an overdose. Right now, it’s a really dangerous time to be an addict; people are dying left and right in my city. I almost dread checking Facebook because it feels like every month there’s another RIP post about someone I knew who has died from an overdose. Drugs are being mixed with deadly amounts of fentanyl, and you never know if the next pill you take could be the one that ends your life.
Losing my boyfriend has been one of the toughest experiences I’ve ever had. If you’re interested, look up drug-induced homicide and the Lost Voices of Fentanyl. I had no idea this was happening all over the country. This crisis is taking out a whole generation! Suboxone saved my life, and I didn’t even experience any withdrawal.

It’s super hard, if not impossible, to get clean when you’re with someone who’s still using. I had to leave the state for 18 months. My advice would be to step away for now, focus on getting clean, and then come back for your kids. Maybe then your partner will see what you’ve accomplished and be inspired to do the same.

I'm 6 months clean after my last Brixadi and no WD except RLS and some insomnia.,3,t3_1koyrsd
2681,mt2nli6,1koyrsd,Tired of this prison.,Sadlittlewolf,"Hey man, if you can possibly get in to a doctor that can treat you with subs, I would say start there. If it’s a cost issue, try the largest medical facility in your region, most are listed as non-profits, meaning they are required by law to offer assistance to individuals who make less than a certain income level. And you might think it’s probably super low, but in our area, my wife lost her job for two months, and they completely erased all expenses from my sons care, her care, reduced my in-house bill by at least 70%, and even fucking dead-ed the debt I had already had go to collections for multiple hospital visits. It was a life saver, and even if you make ok money, the amount you have to make to truly be on the hook if you jump through all the hoops (collect statements from months of finances, prior tax statements, outstanding debts, etc) was mind blowing to me. In our area, it would only be the top, maybe, 20% of earners?

So, find a couple docs who can get you on, start a list, and set that on the table, tape it to the door, whatever the fuck you have to do. While you are searching non-profit hospitals in your area, start digging around on Reddit and online (good articles on topic come from B.C., Canada, where shit’s REAL real, and has been, but they have actual compassion, or at least can do fucking basic math and realized keeping folks alive and not committing crimes/violence is a good thing) and look into:

“The Bermese Method”

Fent is lipid soluble, making subs difficult to transition to, because it can be a long time before PWD isn’t a risk. The above method fixes that. 

Now, you will have to take that list you got and start calling and asking for call backs from the doctors themselves, and telling them you are desperate to get on, but can’t manage it traditional route, and could they work with you on this? You may get many no’s, but many would be willing since you put in the work. If no one will, then you can do it yourself, you’ll just need a little, very basic, less than baking, mixing/blending skills. 

Cost wise: buprenorphine, not suboxone, but buprenorphine solo: dirt fucking cheap. Dirt cheap. You can get yourself to the point where the “dope” (if there really is any, you’re right, scarily) wont affect you because there will be enough bupe to block it after awhile. 

Cons: this takes a little time, (unless you go Lone Ranger and get meds yourself), and every day the drugs get fucking shittier and shittier and any time could be it. But not months, usually, at least. If your stuff is cut with other CNS depressants, could be hard to tell if you’re ready, too. 

Kratom: real option if you can get it where you live. I wish they hadn’t isolated the 7OH because it’s all done for now, soon, I’m sure, but that might be the best place to start. Follow the advice given by the more knowledgeable fellow in this thread, be diligent, work to leaf, and then decide for yourself to stay on that or jump. 

I suggest giving both replacement methods several weeks of honest effort before deciding if you want to stay functional but still somewhat tied, or want to get off for good. If staying on, I’d say Kratom better choice, but it’s all you knowing you, homie.

It may not be possible for you to catch a high on kratom leaf powder , for that you would need the extracts and they will leave you dependent or addicted. But you have to do whatever it takes to get off the street bags. 

The leaf powder however , could probably cut your WD's down to something more manageable while you waited to be clear for Subs so you wouldn't go into PWD. People generally don't go into PWD from Kratom because it is a partial agonist.

2769,mpo0chg,1ka2tqa,First opiate withdrawal,521bhp,"I’m in the UK where the only easy access opioid is codeine and paracetamol or codeine and ibuprofen. They are OTC but very weak, however CWE is easy other than that the other opioids are bought on dark web or dealers obviously. 

I really do feel for you guys in the USA, like how is 7OH completely legal? I started with codeine but moved onto pharma oxy fairly quickly. I had a 300mg daily addiction, I tried to taper then stop but carrying on with daily life and work was basically impossible for me. I moved myself onto subutex pretty easy without precipitated withdrawal due to Oxycodone’s short half life, but I was buying it illicitly. I’m now on a legal prescription and doing well. When moving to bup you’ll have to check the half life of 7OH, it will take a while to explain but essentially buprenorphine has a strong binding affinity meaning if taken too early it will rip the other opioid off your receptors and cause pwd. So you’ll have to wait until you’re in withdrawal then slowly induce yourself on bup. There’s many “tutorials” on reddit. 

Try and get yourself onto buprenorphine it will allow you to have some consistency in your life. Without w/d you can start to rebuild your life around this addiction whilst being stable on buprenorphine. Once you’re ready you will start to taper slowly enough that you won’t notice it. And once you’re down to 1mg each small drop will be a little harder but as your life is better you’ll be able to deal with this a lot better. Comfort meds can help this too.

People relapse every day because of it, do your best to avoid any mood/mind altering substances. I've seen many people go from opiates to alcohol because alcohol is more socially acceptable.
You've proven to yourself that you are an addict. It seems like you already have a good understanding of what can happen if you use.  I attend meetings and I've met so many people like me that have figured out how to enjoy life without using drugs, maybe give NA/AA a shot.

2788,mrdj195,1ka2tqa,First opiate withdrawal,Embarrassed_Brush37,"Hey I was following up on a post 521bhp/  made a year ago when you were considering tapering. So I have been tapering myself. I now take between 2-3 mg/ day and since December 2024 I’ve taken one dose of 2-3mg every 36-48 hrs or more. 

My family is going through some seriously stressful stuff my husband is still using and we have children so now he’s out of the house and dealing with serious legal issues. So that has been hard emotionally to the point it’s physically draining. And I started taking 4mg daily. Just this week I went back down to 2-3 mg and just did my first 36-48 hr stretch between doses. I don’t feel like now is the time to completely stop it because I seriously like the way it makes me feel safe from relapse. I’ve been clean for years I only started taking suboxone because I was going to relapse. I suppose I could have maintained complete abstinence and not started subs but with my husband actively using opiates, I was and still am in such high risk of relapsing.

Anyways all that to say about timing, I find spacing the doses, one dose every 48, seems like it’s working for me. And then maybe when I’m ready doing the 1mg

But I also find that when I go up on the dose I have a harder time spacing it out and when I go down; like let’s say I’m taking 4mg daily and then 48 hrs later I take 2mg, only 24 hrs later I need to dose. So regardless if I’m doing 4mg every 48 and switch to 2-3 mg that 2nd day I need the same 2mg daily I was getting at  (2+2)=4mg every 48 hrs. So I guess if I’m now comfortable on 2 mg every 48 and I want to go down to 1mg I need to take the 1mg daily until I can make it to 30 hrs, 36 hrs, 48 hrs then start going past 48 and keep doing that at the lowest possible dose until I make 72 hrs then on the most minuscule dose just stop completely.

2797,mrdm70i,1ka2tqa,First opiate withdrawal,521bhp,"Well done on getting where you are now! That must be quite hard especially as your husband is in active addiction. 

I understand what you’re doing and you’re doing extremely well. I’ll add my opinion on what could potentially be better and allow you to have a simpler taper as you’re body is not getting used to it as you’re kinda bouncing around all over with the time of dosing etc. not that that is a bad thing. 

I am not a doctor this is just my opinion but I would suggest. You’re now down to 4mg daily, the next drop would be either 2mg every 24 hours, my opinion would be to keep it simply and just keep dosing daily for now. Go down to 2 and stabilize on it. Below 2 you will start to notice the drops more and more and it gets harder the lower you go. Maybe try something like this. Go to 2mg every 24hrs for 2-4 weeks. Then drop to 1mg every 24hrs for 2-4 weeks, then 0.5mg every 24 hours for 2-4 weeks. Then depending how long you can go with splitting up your pill or strip. Go as low as you can possibly can with it. So 0.25mg every 24hrs for 2-4 weeks. Then 0.25mg etc. and 0.125mg… once you’re down to the lowest dose you can possibly cut the pill/strip into then start extending the dosing timeframe. So let’s say you’re on 0.25mg and it’s been 4 weeks on that dose. Thr next step would be 0.25mg every 48 hours so you skip a day. Do this for 2-4 weeks then do 0.25 every 72 hours. For 2/4 weeks then every 96 hours.  Once you’re at about this point you can drop all together and jump off entirely. But don’t feel shit about yourself if you have to take a little more to feel alright. For example let’s say you’re 6 days in and you feel absolutely horrendous and you can’t take this any longer then it’s okay to take a small amount (0.125mg or so) to keep you going, and you can do this for the first few weeks of jumping. Yea it’s going to prolong it a little bit but it will be a smoother ride. 

Keep it simple, maybe plan out in a dairy your doses for the next few weeks. And if you drop too fast and you feel horrible it’s okay to go up and split. For example if you dropped from 1mg to 0.5mg and that is too big of a drop then go to 0.75. And also don’t feel guilty if you need to go backwards for an extra week. Again for example you’re 4 weeks into 1mg and you don’t feel ready to drop, well just go another week on 1. Go easy on yourself, buprenorphine is a very potent opiate and although its peak levels drop around 6 hours it’s got a  long ass 38hour half life doesn’t help things when coming off as it drags out.

Most of my friends who didn’t quit died. Sometimes it takes something drastic like moving out of town, or finding someone to keep you locked in your home. Unfortunately for me it was detoxing in jail that got me clean but I wouldn’t wish that hell on my worst enemy. Do yourself a favor and seriously quit the shit before you end up there or worse.

Edit: I know it’s easier said than done but it’s not impossible. Don’t ever fall into the trap that’s perpetuated about how impossible it is or that it determines the rest of your life even if you get clean. You can do it, you can be happy without it, you can live life without the stress of worrying about it, you can make something better happen but it’s on you to make the move.

Get on subs for the physical part.

My ex fiance of 14 years and mother of my child dealt and is dealing with severe alcoholism. I was positive she was at ""rock bottom"" countless times. I had a quick 6 month love affair with Roxy and quit cold the first time... After I realized that she was in an endless loop and pointing fingers at me for her bullshit, I thought hey, you wanna get fucked up? I'll show you how it's done. This resulted in 3 years and probably 200,000 dollars worth of misery. Faded. I got off the shit, we split shortly after. I'm depressed, I can solve that equation. Addicted again. For a year and 80,000. Been clean for a month and half. Been sleeping like 3 hours if I'm lucky til last week. This was not my rock bottom.. The problem is the environment and the company you may keep. Lose the dealers, lose anyone you do the shit with. I know it's not easy and your mind will always revert back to this shit when things are going your way. But you have to convince yourself that this SHIT IS THE PROBLEM IN THE FIRST PLACE.

2828,m9gpwkm,1iauput,I'm scared my rock bottom is a hole in the ground,ImDffrnt,"I’m just gonna tell you my story because maybe you can relate. I have been on opiates since I was 16. I am now 33. I didn’t really try quitting until my early 20s when I was using every day and learned of withdrawals. The wds were MEAN. I couldn’t last 2 days. 2018 my family convinced me to go to rehab. It didn’t take much convincing because I had been trying to quit on my own and failed miserably. Plus I had got caught with stuff a week before so it only cemented my plan so I could tell the court I completed rehab. Immediately after rehab, I went to stay with family in another state. I should have stayed there because as soon as I got back I was right back to using. I fought to no avail until 2 months ago. I was officially done. I work 2 good jobs and there is no reason I should be broke and in debt at 33, the stuff I was getting probably had tranq in it and I was getting 1-2 hours of sleep at a time every night. I can get away with a lot at my jobs but one of them reached out to me about my attendance and tardiness. It was the perfect storm. Due to holidays and weekend  I had 5 days off from work. The perfect time to do what needs to be done. I did it dude. This is the first time in my life that when I think about picking up, it’s almost always an immediate no to myself. As far as the wds, they were so mild. I’ll tell you what I know works for me. 

About 3 days before I want to stop using, I use the Bernese method. The first day in the morning, you take a tiny piece of sub, I’m talking about the tiniest corner and then you can continue to use throughout the day. You’re going to feel a little crappy but nothing like full blown wd. The next day you’re going to do the same thing, take the same size sub or even a little tiny bit more, the 3rd day you take a little bit more. By the 3rd day you’ll know how much you can take without getting sick. 4th day if you think you’re ready, have no drugs with you, take a little bit more sub and try to quit. You’ll want to be off, in honesty I could have worked this day but I was already off. It’s better to have off but I’m just saying I could have worked. 2nd day, I just went 24 hours without using and I already started to feel better. I was able to eat a little. You’ll also need immodium and preferably a muscle relaxer for RLS but you could also buy high absorption magnesium. I’m just saying that it’s usually 5 days of death when not using. Also I’m not recommending this but I also took edibles and vaped and that was big too. For me. 

I was feeling good on day 2 and I’m not saying it will be the same for you but the thing that helps me most is a positive mental attitude. Music, a hobby, anything to keep your mind off the physical will reduce its effects drastically. Also don’t use the subs for more than 2 weeks or you’ll start to get hooked on those. I wish you the best of luck. You can do it. If you need someone talk to feel free to reach out.

Edit: also kratom helps. I don’t advise taking Kratom because its side effects are still unknown but if you want get the Kratom black ops pills. I took 1 a day for like 5 days. If you can’t get subs, get Kratom to ease the wds. Just don’t take it for more than 2 weeks.",2,t3_1iauput

I was at the point you are were I honestly thought I was going to OD and never get clean. I look back at all the tears I shed because I was so sick of this addiction. I've tried everything in the past and until I didn't surrender to God I didn't get clean.

6 months ago I cracked. Full withdrawal trying to quit. Shitting myself and throwing up for over a week, couldn't move or eat, so sick... confessed to my mom finally and got a ride to the hospital. The doctor on staff works one night a month at the hospital here and he happened to be on when I went it, he specialises in addiction and is the doctor you need to see for suboxkne and methadone. 

He got me a dose for that morning. A few weeks of dose fiddling and I go once a month to the pharmacy ti get my subs and thats it.

I was given IV Dilaudid continuously and 10mg oxy every 4 or 6 hours daily for 9 months. While I was still admitted, they started lowering my dosage out, and it honestly sucked ass. Just drew out the WD process for so long. 

I was released, and was given 60 oxy 15mg. Never ended up taking a single one because my mother (a hard-core alcoholic and addicted at the time) stole them from me. So I ended up going cold turkey. The WD was hell for about a week, then some depression after that for a week or two....but that was because I didn't get out of bed legitimately the entire time. I didn't know the importance of getting some sort of exercise.

Yes you'll feel like crap, but it's nothing you haven't dealt with already. Dont freak yourself out. Exercise as much as possible...even if it's walking around the house. Do anything. Really, anything. Even that'll suck a little bit, but I promise, it helps more than you know. Don't isolate, talk to people. Call someone, invite someone over, talk to someone on here if need be.

There’s unfortunately no way to totally keep withdrawal at bay, and honestly with cancer on top? That’s a lot for one person. You don’t have to do this alone.

Gabapentin and klonopin will help but it’s still gonna suck. I see Clonodine recommended a lot but I don’t have any experience with that. Also, anything that will help an upset stomach. But again, even with all of those..it’s not gonna be fun.

Personally I would say your pain has been insanely bad and you used your script too fast / hydro was not working and you threw it away or whatever the truth actually is here and please doc can we talk about effective solutions I have cancer help me. Something like that. 

The people who are saying Suboxone are idiots do not listen to them. You should be on something decently agonistic that will play well with other opioids in case of breakthrough pain etc. I can't imagine asking a sick cancer patient to go to the methadone clinic at 5am and sit/stand around in the cold with homeless people and jailbirds while being glared at by overweight nurses with acrylic nails and a bad attitude either. But I guess it's an option if nothing else can be made to happen and maybe you can find a bougie one that doesn't treat you like a child and maybe the initial dose plus whatever they bump you up by will be enough to hold you by the time your current supply is out. 

When you do get your meds back consider having somebody responsible to help you dispense them. 

Hope you recover fully and as quickly as possible.

Edit : I do not mean to characterize all methadone clinics as dicey places where clientele is rough and workers are mean. I am sure there are some nice ones or at least not all the nurses are fat and mean and maybe they do gel nails instead of acrylics and maybe not everybody is a criminal and there's nothing wrong with unhoused folks they are human beings who deserve love ( and a house obviously).

Would you be willing to talk to your doctor about MAT? I think suboxone or methadone or even kratom would be the safer alternative for you. It won’t rid you of withdrawals 100%, but it will help.(With subs you’ll have to wait a few days though- whole nother topic if you wanna go that route). I get that you’re in pain as it is, but you just don’t want to be using fentanyl anymore. The MAT should at least address some of that. 

I’m on kratom myself and have been for the last few months, and it’s really helped me with staying off fent. If you have any questions regarding it, I’d be happy to answer so just pm me. Somebody else just asked the other day about what kratom to take exactly to get off fent, so I wrote a pretty detailed response of strains/quantity/etc. The whole deal. Check through my comments, or i’ll pm it to you if you want it.

2920,m61wiv1,1hvcsia,Day 1 please help me. I have cancer.,XxImperatorxX,"This is WAAAAY to complicated for a Reddit answer. You need to talk to your doctor(s) on this one. You say you have cancer but you're concerned about being addicted to opiates, but there's a lot to unpack from that. If you're on Chemo, what kind of Chemo, are you awaiting surgery for a tumor removal, what's your prognosis, etc. This all feeds into the question ""What's going to kill you first, the cancer or the addiction?"" We CANNOT answer that question for you, only your doctors can do that with any degree of confidence. In 99% of addiction cases, the addiction is the clear and present threat to your life. Cancer patients are the 1% of people in the world where addiction may be an acceptable consequence of treatment in the short term, because cancer will likely kill you before your addiction becomes bad enough to become life-threatening.

So again, I say, talk to your doctors NOW. Not tomorrow, NOW. Tell them your concerns, ask about alternatives, see if you can even go on a non-opioid pain medication, depending on your treatment, some meds can interfere with the treatments.

I have cancer.,BnytheScienceguy11,"I think the methadone clinic idea could be a good idea but be weary, I was on it for 4 years and it’s wonderful at first but they don’t call it liquid handcuffs for nothing. Methadone would be a great medicine for you but the clinics ramp your dose up so high and you only dose once a day. If I were you I’d try to find a Dr to prescribe you the 10mg pills to take 2-3 times a day. I think that would work a hell of a lot better than taking 80-150mg once in the morning. You’ll end up nodding off when you get home then be up all night. You could also talk to your dr about buprenorphine patches or taking small doses of subutex throughout the day. Remember with buprenorphine less is more. So micrograms are going to help with pain more than milligrams. If I were you I’d try for the patch and if you can’t get that ask for the 2mg generic subutex (plain buprenorphine pills) and break them into 1/4ths. You can then mix it with your lyrica, gabapentin, and Klonopin. I’d also see about switching from Klonopin to Valium, it has a longer half-life and it helps with muscle spasms and aches. It’s also better than Klonopin for overall anxiety. Don’t get me wrong Klonopin is extremely potent but it’s really only meant for epilepsy. Drs in the US prescribe it too much because it’s less habit forming but it sends your tolerance through the roof. Baclofen is another muscle relaxer that could be a good addition for pain and anxiety. Toradol (ketorolac) not tramadol, is an excellent non narcotic pain med although it can only be taken for a short time. It’s an NSAID but it works like a charm, and it can be given to you in pill form no matter what some drs believe. Tapentadol (Nucynta) is also a good pain med similar to tramadol only much stronger with potency between oxycodone and morphine. Clonidine would be a great add on to help with pain as well",3,t3_1hvcsia

Even tho it is a partial agonist it has an MME of 85 which is almost 100 times stronger than morphine even tho it doesn’t “feel” that way. It really can blow out your receptors and tolerance.

I’d be careful taking the benzos and gabbapentin, too- idk how they’ll affect you together. I have successfully gone from suboxone for a day or two to gabbapentin for WDs and the gabbapentin was amazing. I still remember wondering how I was feeling so good. I took 1 300mg pill 3x day. Lyrica is for sleep right? I’ve never taken it, but I imagine if you can get your hands on some Zofran (ondansetron) too you can be successful although you won’t be totally comfortable. I would get and take the Zofran to help you keep nausea at bay, make sure you’re eating and drinking (Gatorade/pedialyte/powerade/electrolyte packets in water) as well as soon as you can…anyway, take the gabbapentin 3x day, maybe take some klonopin if necessary once throughout the day and definitely at nighttime I would say before the lyrica. I’ve never taken lyrica so I can’t speak fully to that…but I think if that’s absolutely all you have, the only thing you’re missing is some zofran for nausea and you can get through this.

I’ve been clean from opiates a few years now, and it took everything in me to get here. NA and God saved my life. I was broken and numb, losing everything that mattered, but once I started really working the program and letting God in, things slowly started to change.

When the urges hit, I don’t face ‘em alone. I hit a meeting, call another addict, pray, or just ride it out knowing it’ll pass. Play the tape all the way through — that one hit don’t fix anything, it just drags you back to the same hell you’re climbing out of.

What keeps me grounded is my little girl — she’s my reason and my reminder of what I’m fighting for. I’ve been through too much pain to ever go back.

You’re not weak for struggling, bro — you’re strong for fighting when everything in you wants to quit. Keep stacking those clean days, stay close to NA, lean on your Higher Power, and never forget: you’re not just surviving anymore — you’re taking your life back, one day at a time. 💪🖤",3,t1_nlvtcbd

And the PAWS get very severe after several quit attempts or in my case over a dozen quit attempts, the farthest lasting 52 days. I'm a living example of this. Kratom addiction forced me out of desperation to get on suboxone because the crushing depression on it as well as the PAWS off of it were enough to make me go insane or worse.

Nothing compared to methadone or suboxone or heroin withdrawal. But you need to be prepared I had a lot of cravings. Music helped prayer helped bible verses. 🙏 After 5 months it was gone. We can do all things through Christ who gives us strength I would have never been able to contain those feelings of wanting to use. It's like the devil didn't want to let me win this. But I stayed away from people places things. And just remembered it will pass. This was my 2nd try. So be strong and if it's to bad try again when your circumstances are more permitable.  My husband was never an addict never even smoked cigarettes so I had nobody who understood and he didn't believe me and it was harder with him. Thank God he works long hours because that was frustrating in itself. People who aren't addicts sometimes look at us different. But being with a non addict is better for me because then it's easier to use with your partner. So it's very doable I'm just warning you of the mental obstacles your going to face. You got this.

3112,mjn8mgq,1jiwp5t,One year off rent,ForsakenSignal6062,"Just a few examples:

1. CIA & the Contras (1980s)
	•	Background: During the Reagan administration, the CIA backed the Nicaraguan Contra rebels against the socialist Sandinista government.
	•	Drug Link: A 1996 investigative series by journalist Gary Webb (“Dark Alliance”) exposed how Contra groups trafficked large amounts of cocaine into the U.S. (particularly through California). Figures like “Freeway” Rick Ross became major distributors of this cocaine.
	•	Government Awareness: The CIA was aware of and tolerated these operations because they prioritized funding the Contras over stopping drug trafficking.
	•	Outcome: A 1998 report by the CIA Inspector General admitted that the agency had ties to drug traffickers but denied direct involvement.

2. Vietnam War & the Golden Triangle (1960s-70s)
	•	Background: The U.S. military and CIA were deeply involved in Southeast Asia, particularly Laos, Vietnam, and Thailand, where opium production was rampant.
	•	Drug Link: The CIA-backed Laotian Hmong army, led by General Vang Pao, was one of the biggest heroin suppliers during the Vietnam War. The agency allegedly helped smuggle heroin using Air America, a CIA airline.
	•	Frank Lucas Connection: Harlem drug lord Frank Lucas, depicted in American Gangster, smuggled heroin into the U.S. in the coffins of dead soldiers. While this specific detail remains debated, the broader claim of military-assisted heroin smuggling is widely accepted.

3. Iran-Contra & Manuel Noriega (1980s)
	•	Background: In the 1980s, the U.S. supported Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega, a known drug trafficker, because he assisted the CIA with intelligence and anti-communist efforts.
	•	Drug Link: Noriega facilitated the trafficking of Colombian cocaine to the U.S. while on the CIA payroll.
	•	Outcome: The U.S. eventually turned on Noriega, arresting and convicting him in 1992.

4. Afghanistan & the Opium Trade (2001-Present)
	•	Background: After the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, opium production skyrocketed.
	•	Drug Link: The CIA and U.S. military indirectly supported warlords linked to the heroin trade, particularly those in the Northern Alliance. Some sources allege that Afghan heroin funded intelligence operations.
	•	Outcome: Despite U.S. intervention, Afghanistan remained the world’s top heroin producer until the Taliban cracked down on it in 2023.

5. Mexico & “Fast and Furious” (2000s)
	•	Background: Operation “Fast and Furious” was a botched ATF program where U.S. officials allowed thousands of firearms to be smuggled into Mexico, allegedly to track drug cartels.
	•	Drug Link: Some reports suggest that elements of the U.S. government had deeper relationships with cartel members than publicly admitted.",2,t1_mjm3jqc

I hope to be in your shoes soon. I’m coming off 18 days now after 3 years of fetty/pressed blues. I quit 6 separate times but this time has been the longest I’ve been able to keep going without delusioning myself into thinking I can use again every other week or some insane addict shit. 

I haven’t hit rock bottom but I know that I am one inch away from having hit it. You could practically say I did hit it but somehow god has been watching my back, for some fucking reason 1 no clue why, and he’s been sorta giving me the exact thing I need right now to get out before that pit bottom. So I took it as a sign. I know 3 years of highly functional addiction (high paying job and normal life overall minus the drugs) is not as severe as some people but I feel like I had no fucking reason to destroy my otherwise very good life and I’m just ungrateful asshole who looked to feel good all the time and not paying the consequences. Well I’m tryin to pay them now. Because I certainly got myself in debt to the universe. Hoping I can get out of it as soon as possible, but that’s all in god’s hands now.

3148,n66vqhv,1me5zv8,Opioid Withdrawal Is Worse Than Benzo Withdrawal IME,Labyrinthine777,Agreed. Having suffered opioid withdrawals more than 150 times in my life I can confirm you will *never* get used it.,37,t3_1me5zv8
3149,n67cqe2,1me5zv8,Opioid Withdrawal Is Worse Than Benzo Withdrawal IME,johnshonz,"Disagree.  

Acute (not PAWS) Benzo withdrawal lasts several months, if you just stop cold turkey after using for several years, especially if you’re using high potency RC type gabaergic drugs.  

I kicked Etizolam cold turkey after ~50mg / day for three years.  

This is around the equivalent of ~25 Xanax bars every 24 hours.  

I think most people who think benzo withdrawl is not that bad — probably aren’t using that much, or for that long.

Forget hallucinations, at doses this high, you can end up in full blown psychosis, and many do, sadly, if you just stop with no plan or meds.  Every aspect of your sensory perception is completely distorted.. it honestly feels like you have dementia, autism, and schizophrenia all in one, and on top of that you tremble non stop and can barely balance and walk.  You can hear a pin drop five blocks away, but if someone is standing right next to you, trying to have a conversation with you it’s all just white noise.  

It’s like the brain can’t filter out all the stuff that it’s normally able to…
It also feels like you’re in some kind of a tunnel and you just can’t get out. That’s probably the best way I could describe it.  Again, this lasts for **several months**.

Acute Opioid withdrawal (even nasty stuff like nitazenes) is usually over in around a month or so.  Again, PAWS will persist for longer, but there is no comparison really.

Because I was forced to stop cold turkey with no taper or comfort meds / Ashton manual etc, it took me around 18 months to get back to where I was before I started using Etizolam.

There’s also nothing that can be given to stop or alleviate symptoms of benzo withdrawal, aside from more benzos (or similar gabaergic drugs which are ALL just as addictive as whatever you were taking as your DOC), which is a huge problem in the United States because of the drug war mentality, even in the treatment system sadly.  Clonidine etc. doesn’t really work all that well…I mean it will lower your BP, but that’s about all.  You don’t get the same anxiolytic effect that it provides for opioid withdrawal.  Some places will give phenobarb, but that just makes the existing withdrawals even worse, IMO.

Finding medical providers who are familiar with the Ashton manual, which is the gold standard for treating benzo / gabaergic drug addiction and is proven to work — is difficult to say the least.

I first went to my primary care doctor, and he said something like “You’re telling me you’re an addict, and you want me to write you a prescription for Valium, which is a highly addictive medication?!  How did you think this was gonna go?”",7,t3_1me5zv8

Benzo withdrawal makes you feel like you’re in psychosis and your brain is being electrocuted.

Your brain does not produce the dopamine it needs - it expects the drug to do that . So absolutely nothing is interesting.

Funny how I can tell exactly who could handle it and who couldn’t when you think about who they are as people. 

Never mind precipitated wd! I mean I remember inducing way too early on sub. Several times over a decade. And I just would lie there and not move except kicks eventually cus I realized thrashing and moaning made no difference and actually was probably making it worse, and I just surrendered to what was wracking my body, it felt like endless pain, but I knew it would eventually end.

I was lucky though, because I was highly educated in pharmacology and neurology to the extent that I understood what was happening on a receptor level in my brain and I knew that science says this is not going to last.

If it’s something like Methadone the withdrawals last a few months.

3239,n67xpcr,1me5zv8,Opioid Withdrawal Is Worse Than Benzo Withdrawal IME,godDAMNitdudes,"I’ve only experienced withdrawals a few times. I used opioids from ~16 to 27 every day, I’m 28 now, been on methadone/in recovery for a year. In the beginning I would sell / use oxy 80mg, but I also had a job. 

Then, I worked and used Kratom for lil. Then I started using oxy again, but went quickly to heroin. I had a rly responsible, quantifiable use of heroin. I worked a job, and did about a half gram a day, an 8 ball per week, for a few years. 

Then I moved to fentanyl and… my use became really problematic and uncontrollable. For years. My use required so much money, which I got, one way or another. From my girlfriend at the time, for a while (a medical provider, who eventually decided against giving me money for drugs). I asked everyone in my life for money all the time. Eventually my only resource was shoplifting, which I got real good at. The consequence of the money funneling was that everything else fell to the wayside. 

I lived in cars, or on couches. all I did was drugs, and I never EVER ran out for more than a few hours… 

I have gone thru withdrawals, but only once have I gone through them completely — in jail, on the concrete floor. But what was more traumatic for me than the physical symptoms, was the feelings I had within me. My friends and girl bailed me out 10 grand and I was out there getting high a few days later.

Subs always gives me some precips, so I’ve mostly tried to quit with methadone, which has been a pretty painless transition most of the 15 or so times that I’ve tried.

Related: I often used suboxone illegally when I was using heroin, to get me through tougher times because of money, or when I needed to appear straight for a bit or whatever. Going back and forth, I never had the patience to properly wait for the subs to clear out so I could really enjoy that first high.

I was absolutely MISERABLE for the last few years of my relapse. Started with H & then all of the sudden all that was available was fent. I was already so physically addicted by that point I just went with it. I think I enjoyed it for a few months … maybe. I wasted several more years of my life on something I didn’t enjoy because I was too scared to deal with the WDs. When I heard about xylazine it scared me enough to take action. I was terrified of getting physically addicted to something else I hated. Especially since there was no clear way to detox off the random stuff that was being added. I finally decided I’d do anything to end the monotonous suffering. I felt like a slave to my addiction. I couldn’t travel anymore, couldn’t really leave my house for more than a few hours (nor did I want to), couldn’t interact with anyone I actually valued .. the negatives go on and on. I was a ghost in my own life and was to the point that I didn’t care if I woke up or not. So I sucked it up and went to the detox that was actually available immediately and covered by insurance instead of waiting for a spot in a cushy private place. I spent 15 days sweating it out. Didn’t eat for the first 10. I believe I started suboxone on day 6 or 7? I was terrified of precipitated WDs so I pushed it as long as possible. Finally got stabilized and got a a sublocade shot before I was released. It was difficult, but in hindsight it wasn’t nearly as hard as my daily life prior to getting clean. It hurt and I wanted to leave on occasion, but I got through it. I’ve been clean almost 3 years and my life is indescribably different. I’m incredibly happy!!!! I have friends again, I interact with my family in meaningful ways and have a job I love. I feel like I’m living my best life and am sure things will only continue to get better.

It's a complex matter and some of us, like myself have plateaued (after 15 years of addiction) and are doing good. 

Just because I am that doesn't mean I'm going to tell everyone out there to act as I do, and respectfully neither should you. Simple prohibitionist rhetoric from an alleged ex user. 

Are you sure you're being honest with yourself? I only ask as I wasn't being honest with myself when I was on the program, but rather I told myself the story they told me and I had to pretend to believe it to survive. 

There's no one way for all. Purity is a big problem, one of the biggest. So yes, if you're actively using them I suggest finding a pure source of something and plateauing, if using daily, better would be to use even more infrequently which realistically might be more workable if you take a non opioid/ opiate drug on your Opi-off days. As opposed to having nothing at all. 

I wish you all the best OP but these things are how people emotionally regulate, process and live with trauma, in essence they're how some of us function. So telling us to just stop is nothing short of an utterly failed strategy since prohibition was in its infancy to it's current chronic and late stage utter failure.",1,t3_1p1uzzq

In short: to share my experience and question or challenge views that I strongly feel muddy the waters. 

My points don't invalidate OPs points, but rather incorporate more aspects so there can be discourse and less of a Nixon era echoe chamber. 

Before engaging with a clinic one might wish to consider factors such as employment, licenses they may hold or wish to hold that may be effected, careers that may be effected, parenthood/ child services, their freedom and whether or not they're the kind of person that will prosper under the clinic's treatment model. Everyone is different and recovery and growth come in more forms than just buprenorphine, methadone or even abstinence. What is absence worth if it ends in a fatal overdose a year later? That isn't a reason not to abstain, it's a reason to question the experts whose treatments seem more orientated by the war on drugs and policy makers than what leading data suggests as best for the patients. HAT shows a greater efficacy than Buprenorphine.

The matters at hand are nuanced and while somewhere in the region of 40% of people may prosper on the program, I'm simply advocating that we don't leave the other half behind. I do believe it's as much up to us as the professionals, the system is utterly broken for some people. 

Furthermore, if someone has spent a short period of time on Opiates or Opioids, up to a year on something short acting and not too potent, but I'd say a few years even, then going to something stronger and 24/7 like Methadone might not be the best move for them physically or psychologically. Severity of withdrawal seems progressive over time, so one may consider this when it's sweats, goosebumps and cravings in the first year Vs projectile vomiting and an inability to hydrate 10 years later. But the clinics don't question these things and are only too happy to prescribe you Methadone where patients can sit for years or lifetimes compounding their addictions. This is where a competent addiction specialist could spare people before they've really begun. So yes, I do change the one size fits all approach to recovery.",0,t1_npwalc5

I'd never implore that anyone does what I do and so don't respect when the other side does.

Also the methadone clinic remark: that wasn't speaking ill of anyone attending one, but only of some of the professionals that run them and the policy makers who dictate them; and how they can breed an environment where honesty feels impossible unless the patient wishes to trigger prescriptive control, coercive treatments, punitive action or have the clinic come after their driving licence, employment/ career or even their freedom.

Your point may be valid, for you, and it certainly is not for everyone. The irony of going from one drug to another and imploring all do this with no consideration of the impact that can have to the individual. 

We agree on a lot, however I don't think Buprenorphine (nor Methadone) are global saviors: in fact the medical data backs-up that they're actually failing somewhere in the region of 40 - 60% of people. I would imagine those numbers are under-represented given patients routinely manipulate drug tests and the impossible environments that clinics can be for honesty, which is one of the reasons why people fudge drug tests to begin with! Technically I go down in the books as a methadone success story, I don't think you would agree with this sentiment though.

I feel the same about you that engaging with you is one sided, but the thing is it's not just about you anymore than it is me, but rather the implications to the wider community when rigid treatment models that neglect to provide individualized care do more harm than good for a lot of patients.

I do think I understand part of where you're coming from because when I was on the program it helped me to believe the same things you currently do, even if I wasn't being honest with myself, it was that (emotional) safety in numbers thing, that if enough people believe a thing, even if we don't all feel it we can still prop each other up.

However, the longer I spent in that state the worst everything became. To reiterate: it is not just about me or you but rather the stagnant effect and absence of progress that comes when no one, patients and professionals alike are challenging these systems.

Historically our voices have been kept to the shadows by association, and at least in my lifetime absolutely nothing has changed for the better here, so I have no faith in the clinics and believe we all need to find out voices and advocate for better now. The system is not changing from within.

My way doesn't take buprenorphine away from you, but your way enforces a one-way for all approach that the data suggests that is failing between 40 and 60% people. That be actively harmful for people with comorbidities or different neurochemistry. 
It's very narcissistic and self-important of you to be okay about that, and it really demonstrates how you only care about yourself. You deflect like a clinic does when they're on loose footing. 

Honestlyz.I'm not sure how versed you are in these matters. You don't talk like someone who's very well informed. You talk like someone who works in a clinic and you would make an excellent frontline staff member. 'Excellent' as in clinics seem to hire people who tow the line and don't challenge their superiors, decision makers and doctors, are often intellectually incapable making a compelling counterargument and so possess no actual influence over anything besides emotional support and meaningless guarantees that can flip on a dime. 

So here instead decisions come from the prescribing doctor, a person you see or talk to over the one once every five years. Yeah, once. They simply do not know the patient's well enough to provide individualized care. 40 to 60% of people, try thinking about them, rather than just think about yourself.

You can have your Buprenorphine, no one is taking that away from you, and I am so happy if it works for you even if you're not very personable, you still deserve treatment that accommodates you. You could give others that same courtesy that they give you.",1,t1_npyud91

What I'm assuming is the post that inspired this one, was actually a pretty respectful comment section. Its reddit, and we're addicts, so there is always going to be a level of toxicity.


But for the most part, the parts of OP's post that were problematic were called out mainly with people just sharing their own experiences. Even though ""Fuck Suboxone"" is very disrespectful way to invalidate other people's experience. 


It doesn't feel good when you're in the minority opinion on any topic. But it's something we have to figure out a way to live with, because we aren't going to be in the majority 100% of the time. It is absolutely not crazy for a community of recovering opioid addicts to be skeptical of a new ""wonder drug"" that ""cures"" addiction. There have been several substances that have been touted as such in the past few decades, not to mention big pharma originally claimed prescription opioids themselves were non-addictive. The same was claimed about kratom.  


It's a shame people aren't a tiny bit more open minded to new potential treatments, but it's really easy to understand why. You specifically seem to be having a lot of trouble with this and I'm sorry for that. But if it does work as advertised, it will still take a very long time to achieve widespread acceptance. The scientific research on it is in its very, very early stages. 


Maybe take a step back and think about how you're perceiving as toxic the very real reticence of the community to move away from something that has worked for millions of people, in favor of another drug that promises to be a miracle cure. Being in the minority sucks, but don't confuse that with people being judgemental. And don't confuse all judgementality as harmful. Bad ideas need to be called out.

Long.  Oxy withdrawal was intense but it was relatively short comparatively if you're on day two, you're almost halfway.  With all those comfort meds, especially Xanax, you have no excuse to fail.

3342,n461s6z,1m4dnbi,i relapsed,[deleted],"You're not alone. I had a dozen years of total abstinence and replapsed on prescribed oxycodone for 7 herniated discs, among other painful health conditions, but I know it was my trauma, part of which was grief, that really contributed to going from not abusing it to liking the pain relief in my brain as well as my body. Don't be too hard on yourself. I tapered down off oxy a few times on my own, even down from 300 mg/day at one point. The PAWS and a resurgence in severe pain, plus a dearth of availability of prescription meds, led me to H. Did that for a year, caught a misdemeanor, lost my job, and got on MAT, which has worked for the last several years. It helps manage pain, and I've been able to rebuild my life in some amazing ways. I started a taper a little while ago and will switch to sublocade to get completely off. I've read here that the sublocade is pretty easy to walk off. There's some good advice here. The comfort meds should help, as others have said. You can take 0.2 clonidine if needed, as long as your BP and HR aren't too low. It ""hides"" adrenaline from the brain, lowers heart rate, and helps with sleep. I believe you can do this. I commend you for stopping after just a couple of months as opposed to a couple of years, like me. That alone should help you bounce back from PAWS more quickly. I'd recommend MAT as a very last resort (since it hasn't been a long relapse) and only for a few days to detox. I used to be gung ho 12-step and worked in the treatment industry (worst mistake of my life). I feel very differently now, so if 12-step also doesn't work for you, therapy can be a huge help, plus support from close family or friends, and support from here, too. If you're really struggling with grief, maybe try to find a good trauma therapist or at least one that specializes in grief and loss. It's a unique, brutal type of pain and can be quite lasting. I feel for you. I also believe you can do this, both the short-term detox and the long-term coping. You have a proven record of success. That's not lost.

I'm so with you, not only because of the horrible attitude people have toward MAT in 12 step (which I'm ashamed to admit I bought into for a while), but also because of the horrific judgment for other things, too. I found a lot of shame in steps 4 and 5, at least how people worked them in my areas. The worst part for me was that when I relapsed, only one person tried to find and help me. Everybody else, including people who told me we would be friends forever, turned their back. Worse yet, when my name was in the paper for catching a charge, a picture of it was taken and passed around by these so-called ""friends."" And some were people I stood by as they chronically relapsed. 12 years of being a huge member of that community, and that was the betrayal with which I was rewarded. Meanwhile, MAT has success rates of 50 to 75%, while abstinence-based programs are 1 to 3%, but the victim-blaming narrative of, ""rarely have we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed our path"" persists. It's a shame because I did learn a lot from some wise people in 12 step - lessons I still apply in my life, but they are tainted by the pain of betrayal, judgment, rejection, and even predatory behavior I witnessed and experienced in those spaces. So. I appreciate your reply. It can be hard to find empathy from folks about this as well as open-mindedness to the other options out there for changing your life, of which there are plenty.

Eventually you can space them out more ideally 4 hours apart and then work your way off of them by taking one less capsule or half a gram less if it’s raw powder.

And every fuckin thing I took made me either happier than I’ve ever been in my life (opiates), or made me feel absolutely not one thing at all (mood stabilizers and SSRI’s) and you know what the one thing was that I never tried?  Pure and complete sobriety.      
       
Life fucking SUCKS sometimes bro. You’re GOING to have a shitty day once in a while. You WILL feel a broken heart. You WILL fall on hard times. You can’t control it. Nobody gets out of life alive. But you have to learn how to put that shit behind you in order to have the emotional strength and intelligence to process these things as they happen in your life. Because at the end of the day, the only person who can solve your problems and save you is yourself.        
      
I didn’t want anything clouding my judgement on how to deal with and live my life. Maybe I’m *him.*        
       
So I went cold turkey because I knew who I was then and I didn’t fucking like that guy. I knew there was another guy on the other side of this, ready to go to rehab, ready to change his life, ready to learn and grow and level up.     
         
So I took a gamble on who the guy was on the other side of graduating an inpatient, and then outpatient rehab program and nothing but talk therapy, a clean as fuck diet, physical exercise, and a creative hobby. Turns out I’m not bi polar - I just needed to relearn how to regulate my emotions.      
      
Turns out once I started actually exercising every day, and waking up the next morning at the same time, I actually slept great through the night, giving me the energy to make it through a work day.       
      
Sometimes I have shitty days because everyone sometimes has shitty days. I am not special. But whatever today’s problem that happened to have landed in my lap is mine and mine only so I either deal with it or it deals with me. I don’t think about my abusers because fuck them, what they did to me didn’t define me. They just put shit in my way that with a little help and encouragement I could move out of the way or weight I was carrying I could put down. I can’t control the past but I know if I don’t focus on how great right now is or could be, then maybe one day I’ll look back and wish I was focused on what was awesome instead. Because there’s always *something* awesome. Always.          
      
So yeah I will recommend cold turkey to almost everyone who doesn’t have some critical mental illnesses that could cause semi-permanent incarceration like schizophrenia. Because your shit heals *so* fast and once the worst part of that journey is over, every single day of your life going forward gets exponentially better than the last.

3386,n28ap1z,1lvqtpb,Why do people go cold turkey?,BC122177,"In my experience it’s because the overall withdrawal time is shorter. If you’re tapering off of let’s say, suboxone. The withdrawals last longer because that stuff lives in your fat. It takes longer to get out of your system, making the physical and mental withdrawal last a longer period of time though not as intense. 

I also think cold turkey causes quite a bit of relapses due to not having made life adjustments. Not weeding out your friends who still use. Not cutting ties with plugs and not dealing with the overall issues of using in the first place. Therapy made a world of difference for me while I was on subs to taper off without the cravings. I made my life changes, got rid of people who still used or offered. The few that was still around knew I was quitting so when they used, i had no knowledge of it. Because they knew I wanted to stop and they didn’t want to be the reason why I lapsed. So that’s why we’re still friends. 

People also likely have a hard time affording therapy + suboxone so cold turkey could be their only escape. Even if they do end up relapsing. When the cravings hit or someone offers a little, it’ll be a lot easier to say sure! I’ll just do 1 or 2 and that ends up being another few months. 

I’ve done both. I’ve cold turkey’d multiple times and tapered off of subs twice. Cold turkey definitely shortened the withdrawal time but I was on scripted opiates so I could easily ask my dr for more at the time. Which I did and got right back on it. Suboxone with therapy over a longer period of time is when I was able to get rid of it for good.

It never worked for me and I’ve tried many times.  However, every time CT is the only thing that’s worked for me and it’s easier and faster than withdrawing from MAT.    I’d definitely take comfort meds like advil, gabapentin, etc not sure if that is what you meant by CT.

The only exception is sublocade which I highly recommend.  Getting a monthly injection is considerably more challenging and helpful than taking medication daily.  In a way it’s similar to CT because you lose the control over changing how you feel in any way.

I don't remember what set him off that day, but afterwards I just thought ; I'm not doing this anymore. I went to the Dr's. I said I can't do this anymore and the program isn't working for me. Their solution? We'll increase your methadone. The same solution for the last few months. I walked out. 
Methadone blatantly wasn't working for me. Granted I was using on top but my life was a mess. My ex would use in front of me and keep offering when I was clean til I relapsed. I had nowhere else to go. I deliberately didn't collect my methadone for 3 days - in the UK that automatically gets you kicked off the programme. This time I was determined. Day 4 I was iller than I've ever been. I tho7ght I was dying. I didn't score. I went to A and E. I told them I am actively killing myself. If I carry on I won't make it to 23. The triage nurse quietly told me ; they won't do anything here unless you are a danger to yourself or someone else. Then they might section you under the mental health act. Also there would be no detox or MAT- they had issues with people withdrawing going to get themselves sectioned to get some sort of MAT (the waiting list for programs was around 3 weeks at that time)
Long story short- I got admitted. The next day I woke up, vomitting, violent diarrhoea, seeing things, so weak. But clean. I was like that for about 10 days. It was 8 days before I could make it to the bathroom without help.

No. At least in this case, if you utilize helper meds along with plain leaf and/or MIT and taper off all of it, it can be rather painless other than the drops that need to stabilize a day or two. I've done the CT thing many times when I was younger. Almost always failed. Even did it with benzos several times. I shouldn't have and wound up on MAT drugs anyways. (That I successfully tapered off of.)

Short-acting drugs like 7oh are nearly impossible to taper on their own because of the extremely short half-life. You're just constantly flip flopping back and forth into withdrawal.

People who say this have no idea how tapering works. Tapering doesn't draw out the suffering, unless you're doing like a three day ""taper"" from a large habit. But in that case, that's not even really a taper, it's just running low and then running out lol. If a person is able to actually do a taper, it's a long, slow process that doesn't involve suffering until maybe the very end, at which point your taper is done and you jump off.

But you're right that if someone takes 20 pills a day for years (just a random made up example) and decide to ""taper"" by taking 3 pills a day for 3 days, then yeah that's gonna be miserable because that's not a legit taper. But if they're able to do 19 pills for a few days, then 18 pills for a few more days, then 17 pills, etc, they won't have any suffering at all, because their body is able to adjust to the new dose without withdrawing.",2,t1_n28c3w3

That’s it right there. You can sweat it out, puke, shiver and scream for a week but if your environment and mindset stay the same, you’re basically setting yourself up for round two.

And I feel you on the affordability side too. Not everyone has access to therapy or a stable taper plan. That’s where I think basic tools — nothing scripted, nothing addictive — can make a real difference. Even small stuff like NAC, meditation, or journaling gave me more grip during chaos.

3459,n2exzlo,1lvqtpb,Why do people go cold turkey?,Decent-Fun190,"Yes, they do. But personally I’d add this:

Kratom (capsules only – no extract, no 7-OH tablets). Red Bali is a great strain. I wouldn’t take it too long though, otherwise you're just replacing one addiction with another.

When I came off heroin and benzos, I used:

Kratom – works, but can be addictive if used too much or too long

Psilocybin – microdosing only the first month, non-addictive

L-Tyrosine – non-addictive, supports dopamine

NAC – non-addictive, helps with cravings and brain balance

Lion’s Mane – non-addictive, neuroregenerative

Citicoline – non-addictive, focus and memory

Magnesium bisglycinate – non-addictive, helps with anxiety and sleep

Omega-3 – go for the highest DHA you can find


After about a month I did a single macrodose of psilocybin. That reset my brain in a way nothing else did.
That said: don’t do a macrodose by yourself. Set and setting are everything. Have a guide or at least someone you trust nearby.

With this stack I’m assuming you’re only coming off tranq or opioids — no SSRIs or other psych meds, since those could interact badly, especially with psilocybin and L-Tyrosine.

- It took protein and collagen to help my skin heal, I tried to get out in the sun often. 

 - smoked weed every 20 minutes as soon as it would wear off and I'd feel the stinging sensation on my skin again. 

- I got Ashwagandha & Rhodiola concentrated liquid and took a few droppers everyday. Same with vit D liquid (big difference in mood after a month or two)

- took lion's mane + turkey tail capsules made by a friend. Microdosed 🍄 

- I focused on intuitive and mindful eating, ""eating the rainbow"" and only eating anything VERY nutrient dense for healing and very little if ever sugars, no alcohols, minimal meat. 

- I had multiple baths or showers a day (godsend solution for Precip WD also) sometimes a cold cloth and wiped my skin down. Got a cold blanket and wore bamboo clothes.

- I got a prescription for clonidine, gabapentin, and oxybutynin (technically for incontinence but helps with sweating prefusely) I didn't love clonidine because it made me zombie like and felt heavy/lazier. Naproxen for body aches.

- picked the active things I loved (body hooping and yoga in my case) did that a couple hours each day and always listened to music I felt therapeutic.

- I took CoQ10 to help my heart, fish oil& evening primrose, Glucosamine for my suffering joints from 12 years of opiate use through my early teens and formative years.

- Super sleep tablets/melatonin/prescribed sleep medication to test depending on my day. 

- I started writing 3-6 hours a day and actively teaching myself about addiction, the brain, sobriety, genetics & DNA, psychotherapies, anything related to recovery etc. Also went to dbt and a bereavement counsellor. 

- I put a lot of affirmations around me, and a lot of my favourite quotes/reminders/helpful things to remember. Your mind is your biggest alliance of you kindly treat it as such. 

I tried so hard to help myself recover however I could and it worked well i'd say given my previous 10-20 attempts at sobriety over previous years didn't work out. I practiced a lot of mindfulness and focused a lot on self-help. A lot of gratitude, a lot of learning. A lot of realization of the WHYs (why I am the way I am, why my brain does __, why I turned to ___ etc etc.) 

At one point my Mum was calling me a walking pharmacy. I was taking things that were as natural as I could find to help soothe the many pains. My body and brain were rewiring and I tried to think of each thing as ""helping my body recover properly and gently"" 
Anyways, sorry if this was long but this was the majority of the things that I did to get through the journey as mindfully as I could. Shit is hard🖤",3,t1_n28auwg

Much respect for how you laid this out — no magic cure BS, just raw self-discipline, intention, and consistency.

3472,nbs5bv4,1n5ak38,"My Post Regarding Posts about SR-17018 Removed by Mods, Was removed by the mods",saulmcgill3556,"I don’t know why the post in question was removed — which I took the time to communicate to OP last night, not wanting to leave this very issue unaddressed. As I said in my message, I saw it as a genuine inquiry for clarification, which I appreciated. Because this is a topic being posted about so frequently (albeit by a limited number of people), it obviously needs clarification. As I said then, I wanted to review each of the SR-related posts that had been removed to give a full analysis before formally notifying the community of any policy changes or clarification. I’ve not had the time to complete that in the last 18 hours (I work Sundays), so here we are and I’ll give you the best I can. First, please understand a couple things: 

1) The community at large does not have access to the same information as we do, which is why a request for clarity was absolutely valid, imo.

2) We have limited people and very limited time. I was able to confer with one other mod today because I do not make unilateral decisions. I logged on tonight to look into more about this specific post, but now I’m responding here.

3) If something has members of this community confused or upset (legitimately upset — not just personally aggrieved and belligerent), it genuinely matters to me. If you’ve been here the last 5-6 years, I think I’ve proven that.

4) My top priority will always be keeping the members of this community safe, as well as the community itself (that means working with Reddit)

So here’s some information. I prefer to be organized/thorough, but rather than have more fires to put out, I’ll give some quick info: 

• *(As of roughly two weeks ago)* We saw a spike in posts about SR. Most of them make it to feed but some were flagged by Reddit due to user history. We then began receiving reports from members being solicited for this over DM, with screenshots. With some investigation, more than half of them were traced back to accounts soliciting our community members *and/or* accounts flagged by Reddit for ban evasion and scamming/shilling in other communities. Please note there’s been a sticky on the front page for some time which addressed the early phase of this issue.

• Many of the other posts (and I can promise you anything I had to remove) were clearly in violation of the rules against medical advice. Others, it seems, were overrun with comments violating sourcing, soliciting and medical advice policies. This is why a mod may have taken down a post in which the OP was not at fault. In those cases, I hope that was made clear, but I can’t say right now. Regardless, if it wasn’t, it should’ve been.

We’re going to issue more information for the entire community and clear policy around this in the coming days. One of the difficult things we have to weigh is that even a legitimate post about someone’s actual experience, breaking no rules, also brings potential harm in the way of solicitation to desperate people who could either lose money or receive something that is not what they think. This RC is being heavily marketed in many communities, with some people selling inauthentic and *dangerous* chemicals. 

If you’re someone who has personally had success with this, that’s *great,* and I hope you have the maturity to understand nothing about this is personal (unlike someone in the comments spreading patent lies about me). The interests are exactly as I’ve stated them, and I am committed to keeping this community  a group of people who are useful to one another and invested in one another’s success. If you’re reading this, I hope you are, too. More information to come shortly — hopefully from someone who is not me. Thanks. 💞",1,t3_1n5ak38

They technically don't have to provide a reason whether it breaks a rule or not, but I would hope that they've all had internal discussions about it and agreed on something rather than it just being one rogue mod. 

It's probably something around this not being an officially recognised form of MAT/unregulated or something to that effect. Rule 2 references that:

>This includes posting photos of drugs or paraphernalia, posts that describe the lifestyle of drug use in great detail without discussion of recovery topics, *and “talking up” other illicit or unregulated substances* as this may be triggering for members.

Now that’s not to say people can’t be harmed by it without the proper information. Many have died after not taking into account its effects on tolerance after a relapse.

It seems rather easy to understand for me, but it’s affirming to have that validated. Too often (in society), the people with the least information are the loudest and most aggressive voices. I need to be mature enough to recognize that.

I’m not going to psychoanalyze, but I know some people are  geared toward assuming anything frustrating or limiting is personal. I’ve tried everything in my power to explain how it is not, including detailing the verifiable reasons. Believe me: I would *much* rather spend the time I do have here engaging with people and offering experience, support and information. I hate having to consider restricting anything but I have to accept that: a) it’s not all my decision/I’m not the cause; and, b) there is a much larger interest to protect. Frankly this has been very frustrating on a number of levels, and my time has never been more limited. But if a couple members want to blame something on our few mods — and especially me personally because I’m the one responding — I’m okay with that. But it’s not okay to baldly lie about me in an effort to malign my reputation. And that goes for anyone here. Thanks again to everyone, and there will be even more explanation around this shortly.

3477,nbrjxk7,1n5ak38,"My Post Regarding Posts about SR-17018 Removed by Mods, Was removed by the mods",BC122177,"When this sub first started, there were a total of 3 mods. I used to be one but it was a throwaway account (reddit_username_42 or something silly) so I can’t remember the password for it. I definitely cant remember the yahoo email address for it either. But that was damn near 20 years ago. 

The rules were pretty loose and if I recall, discussed pretty heavily via chat. Because we didn’t want to discourage anyone from posting what their methods were or even posting to say hi. This sub was created because the opiates sub always downvoted anyone wanting to get clean to oblivion. We wanted a place where people who wanted the nightmare to stop could post. Ask for help and offer help or even have a few people to chat with if they wanted. So the rules were pretty loose.

Major no no’s were discussing any potential ways to use/abuse MAT meds and getting high off of them were banned. Medical advice was also banned and of course, doxing. 

Not sure why that topic would be deleted, as I think it’s a valid of a topic as kratom. I don’t agree that kratom should be a way to get off of opiates because I’ve seen those same people take that advice and come back months later asking how to get off of kratom but I didn’t think that should be a delete or banned topic. Because it helps people just the same as Suboxone, subutex, ibogane..etc. so many methods have been discussed here throughout the years. Many i agreed with and many i didn’t. But unless it was horrible advice or medical advice in general, it was fine.

I’m definitely interested in learning more about SR because I’ve heard great results from it. I don’t see a reason why it should be deleted or a banned topic. Sharing experience and offering some non-medical advice should be a good thing for this community. 

It definitely should be a valid topic to chat about. Especially considering not many people know about it and I’d rather they get facts through people who have experience with it or even just direct them to the SR sub.

With that in mind, please be cautious and don't let your mind play any tricks on you. I cannot tell you how many times I went through withdrawal, made it 15-30 days and then ended up using once I started to actually feel better. 

It's crazy how short a memory of the true pain of withdrawal our brains seem capable of holding. During the experience I'd be so sure I'd never ever put myself in such a terrible spot again, but then I'd find myself thinking crazy shit about how maybe withdrawal wasn't actually that bad.

Your state may have its own FMLA act as well that are sometimes more pro worker rights than the federal law.

I see there is already a response regarding FMLA, so I just want to acknowledge that as it’s something so many people (not necessarily you) don’t fully understand.

Staying there that long waiting for a bed could sound like a throwaway fact, but I know the reality of how hard that had to be. And you did it! How long was your stay in detox?

Regarding where you go from here, I generally recommend people have at least a skeleton of a continuing care plan outlined before they’re discharged from detox. If you’re at the point now where you’re putting that together, there are two things I think are critical: 

1) Timeliness: statistically and anecdotally, you want to have as little time as possible in between (ideally none). It sounds like you are primed to move forward and that momentum can be extremely fragile.

2) If you need help initiating that process, you’re welcome to reach out to me. Ime, it’s incredibly difficult to do on your own.

Again, I’m thrilled for you. I’ll *never* forget the feeling of unburdening I had when I was no longer physically dependent… it was like I couldn’t even believe it. I’m wishing you the best as you move forward.",2,t1_mctkapw

I think it takes at least a year or so in order to get back to a baseline. Are you regularly sleeping at least? 

I couldn’t sleep more than 3-4 hours even at 4 months, which led me back to using along with the depression. The PAWS are truly the worst. I regret it immensely because now I’ll have to start over again. Your post really resonates with me because I mourn the person I was before addiction as well. I didn’t become an addict until I was already an adult at 23. It’s going on 7 years for me and I can’t believe this is my life still.  

You mentioned being envious of people who have passions, interests, and goals. Why don’t you start journaling and try figuring out what exactly it is you want to do? The depression after WDs/addiction is no joke, it’s like depression on steroids. You might want to consider SSRIs temporarily until you get to a better headspace.

Well, I did but I didn't stay sober and THAT is what you need to take away from this. Shit might seem bleak now but addiction, especially opiates are hard to recover from and takes a lot of time and effort. I'm 46 and coming up on 11 months next week and I still haven't found complete happiness but I'm getting there. I had to go to treatment for awhile and now I'm in sober living IOP making 5 meetings a week and group everyday plus I still have to work and somehow I still make time to workout, meditate and touch some grass. 

It's only when you can appreciate the fact you're still sucking air when by all accounts you shouldn't be that you'll begin to feel a change. Eventually you'll be grateful to be alive regardless of how your day to day life might be. It's not rainbows and unicorns, life can be a motherfucker but it can also be beautiful when you take time to enjoy the parts you can. I feel like I'm over wanting to use substances ever again but I know me and I know if I'm not working on myself everyday I'll find something to fixate on that'll fuck my life up once again. Anyway, my point is I don't have any friends really and I'm far away from my family. I have kids that would give anything to see me right now but I have to see this process through completely and I haven't yet. I'll know when it's time just like you will know when you're mostly recovered and can move on with life because as of now it sounds like you still have some work to do.

I don’t know how to cope or live",Chubbyhuahua,"You’ve been sober 5-6% of the length of time you were getting high. Not only that, you spent a key transition phase in your life (14 to 24) getting high so you didn’t develop the way you otherwise would have. Given the above it makes total sense that you’re feeling like shit. This is very common and will pass. The absolute best advice I can give you is to find some sober running buddies. It sounds like you had running buddies you used to do drugs with now do the same in sobriety. I know it’s awkward but find 2-5 guys who are around your age and also in early sobriety, get their phone numbers, and actually call them. Go to meetings together but also do normal life shit together: Chase girls (or men), go to concerts, shoot the shit over a coffee, whatever 24 year olds do now a days. I see it time and time again, younger guys who come into the program tend to stick around when they have a group of guys they can lean on. These will become the guys you call when you run into your old dealer on the street and he’s talking about the BOGO deal he’s got for returning customers. It will (or at least can) save your life.

This common. You’re not unique but you are special and people want to see you succeed. As I have been around longer I see it more and more. Young guys come in off the street with nothing to their name and they are miserable. A few months pass and they are still miserable but they are sober and have a little time. A year later they are still a little miserable but they finished their degree or started a new job and are dating someone. And at some point they stop being miserable. They end up with all the things that they thought they would never be able to get or achieve when they first got sober. Most of them end up getting, or doing things, well beyond what they wanted when they first got sober because they weren’t even on their radar at the time.

Time takes time and you’re super young. You’ve got this.

EDIT: I went back and realize you are a 24f. I wrote the above from the perspective of a “guy” but it is applicable regardless of gender. Find some running buddies ideally of the same gender. And, I know that no one listens to this advice, but try to avoid any romantic relationships for awhile. It’s one of the most common reasons I see people go out in early sobriety.",2,t3_1ignflx

I don’t know how to cope or live",red_neck_beard,"I just wish you could feel all the hugs and love people are sending out to you right now. You are amazing and you are worth it. At 24 to get clean? I know it feels like you wasted all your potential but you haven't even come close. I'm 41 with 2 kids as a single father and have only 3 months clean. I pissed away so much. The difference with me now and back then is simply acceptance. 

I have a sponsor but I started the first step almost a month ago and haven't even picked it back up. You got me there too. And the fact that you're doing all this while feeling like you do is a huge testimony to your inner strength and resiliency. You are so much more than you're giving yourself credit for ,or what your emotions are letting you feel.

Holy shit, the part where you say running back to the safety of stagnancy. That is exactly how I feel. I haven't picked up my step work because I apparently don't want recovery more than I want to stay in this new comfort zone. A comfort zone where I'm able to stay clean but not allow myself any growth. And you are pushing through even with how you feel. No joke, you are a fucking bad ass. 

You are also able to articulate exactly how you feel with a degree of accuracy most people have a hard time with. Have you considered poetry?

I've heard it said in NA that if you give it a year and don't feel better they will refund your misery. It will get better with time. Our emotions let us know we are still alive but emotions themselves are not the end all be all. They come and go and eventually they pass and become something else. I wish you could learn to give yourself credit. I wish you could learn to give yourself the grace and understanding that you deserve. You are still young, you have great strength inside of you, and you have an intelligence and eloquence about you. You have so much potential. It's hard not to focus on what's behind us or what's lost. The problem is that when we do that we can't see what's in front of us and we can't see what's been found.

OP: it does take time. This is why acceptance is such an indispensable tool. Accepting this process on its own time is seeing the forest from the trees. The first time I experienced joy in recovery (which I’ve posted about here and IG) was almost three months into my recovery, and it was fleeting. BUT, it was crucial because it gave me some hope. 

After long-term addiction like you were in, you’ve been conditioned [biopsychosocially](https://www.curevine.com/resources/bio-pyscho-social-model) into a state that is less capable of finding joy or pleasure; more easily triggered into emotional distress. How long this lasts is a product of your perspective, your actions now, and your body’s resilience. 

There are practices that can expedite one’s return to physiological homeostasis. What does your average day look like? Do you work? Do you live with anyone else? Do you engage in any activities with other people? Do you engage in any physical activity/exercise? Have you done AA/SMART or any kind of recovery program? Knowing these things will give me a much better understanding of your condition. I’m also happy to answer any questions.",5,t1_maq9bmv

Try not to focus on the negative and more about this opportunity you have. Perhaps this experience will lead you to a path that educates others in the same situation while you get paid good money for it like a counselor. But you have to seek it and obviously get well yourself trusting you never go back. 

You can’t help your environment on getting as much sunshine as possible but your consistent intake of vitamin D should suffice but don’t overdo it. You can get health complications from that.

Erratic sleep routine affects *so many* areas of our well being — which is obviously more vulnerable in early recovery. Sleep has been a massive problem for me my entire life. The illusion of control over my sleep was a big part of addiction. That sounds like an area that could be improved, and frankly, a regular sleep schedule is one of the most impactful and foundational aspects of developing routine, and physiological homeostasis as well.

3637,n3x7m72,1m33ecm,I just want it to be over.,njensen,"Hey man, I'm just going to share my story here because I can definitely relate to you in multiple ways ...

So, about 2 years ago my girlfriend passed away from an overdose, that sent me into a deep depression. I had been an addict at that point for about 15 years of my life. I totaled my truck, not necessarily on purpose but to say I wanted to survive the accident would be a blatant lie. I woke up in the hospital with 6 broken ribs and 2 brain bleeds. I pretty much left immediately upon waking and walked out with no shoes to go score.

So, because of that accident - I got in trouble with the law. This led to me having to do court ordered probation and in turn treatment. After my first assessment they sent me to inpatient. I left after not even a full day. 

Inpatient has never been for me, I don't really get along with most other addicts or even like them. So, after leaving inpatient I had to get another assessment done. With a little convincing, I was able to attend an outpatient class and I got on methadone. I had been on methadone in the past and it really was the only option that took care of my withdrawals. Subs didn't do shit for me. 

So, after being in the outpatient class forever and having dirty UAs constantly they essentially ""graduated"" me so to speak. I was kind of in limbo and wouldn't be in compliance until I got a clean UA but I didn't have to keep going to class. This is definitely not the norm, my counselor and teacher of the class is just a certified badass who actually listened to what I was saying and took my concerns into account.

So, since I wasn't in compliance - when I went back to court one of the times they got kind of fed up with me and gave me an ultimatum - either get in compliance or go to jail. This kind of nudged me into the right direction. To say that court was the sole reason for me getting clean is not true at all. I'm 37 years old, I was getting real tired of the lifestyle. I knew if I didn't get my shit together soon I was going to have a much harder time doing the things I wanted to with my life. The main one being finding a woman I could share my life with and hopefully grow old with. 

That wasn't going to happen if I was an addict. The main reason being that I wasn't happy with who I was as an addict and I didn't feel I could offer that special someone my genuine self if I was actively addicted.

So, 34 days ago I made up my mind to be fucking done. I've attempted to quit in the past, innumerable times. This time though, this time has been so much different. My resolve is crazy right now. I've turned down countless offers to use and at one point I had to deal with a dental abscess which scared my loved ones into thinking I would use. Nah, didn't even cross my mind. That's how I know I'm done now. I'm so sure of myself this time around, there's too much at stake and way too much I want to accomplish now.

After about a week and a half of not using, I started getting my energy back. I never, NEVER thought I would be able to be interested in shit without drugs or have energy again. I feel like I have the most energy I've ever had in my entire life. I'll go to bed at night at like midnight, wake up at 5 or 6am without an alarm and feel so fucking refreshed. It feels SO fucking good. Like, I'm happy - I'm proud of myself. It feels so soooo good. I just could never see this happening in my wildest dreams but I'm so fucking thankful that it did.

One other thing I'm incredibly happy about is that I was able to do it without attending NA or getting a sponsor or any of that. If that's your thing you need to be sober, more power to you. I just never saw that being my thing. I'm too antisocial and introverted. Also, as much as this may piss some people off, the people in NA and all that always struck me as super One-Dimensional and kind of annoying as fuck if I'm being honest. 

So yeah, I guess if I were to give you any kind of advice... Find a reason to live. You have to figure out what you want in life and be 100% honest with yourself. If you do that, I think you'll find that whatever it is you want, you won't be accomplishing it while actively using hardcore drugs.

Good luck man, I wish you all the best.",4,t3_1m33ecm

""Knowing how to feel better"" is an organic process made possibly only by first addressing the physical aspects of your current dilemma. I can't suggest to you HOW to do it ( getting free of the physical aspects of your addictions ) only that it is the very first thing you'll need to address.

You'll never feel ""better"" if you are being whipsawed by varying degrees of using/kicking/relapsing ad nauseum etc. Please forgive anything that reads as being ""unsympathetic"" but it's not. Ya just gotta get clean. First!

  
Best of luck to you brother. Your journey and life stage is such, that handling this shit NOW is wise. You've got plenty of time to turn it all around. Once you get clean. Also if that involves methadone or Subutex...( whatever it takes to clear the hurdles of the physical cravings if Rx'd - is good ) . The advent of the ""shot"" is really promising too when used as an aide to titration ( opiates were your DOC? ). I wish they'd had the sub;ocade when I tried getting off of Suboxone.

It can truly feel like you will *never* be able to get out. But you're absolutely right, no matter how deep in it you are, you can always get out.

You can't be afraid to ask for help, either. I tried getting clean on my own for years, because I had hid my fent addiction from absolutely everyone. No one knew I had a problem, I had a good job, in everyone else's eyes I was doing great. But in reality I was so deep in my addiction I genuinely thought death was the only way out for me. It wasn't until I reached a point where I was suffering so much that I knew it was either ask for help, or I would kill myself that day, that I finally reached out to my family and told them what was happening and how desperate I was to end the suffering. That was my first step in my long (and still ongoing) road to recovery.

That first step is the hardest. Because recovery will often change your life, I had to quit my job and move in with my family. But it was so worth it. Because it doesn't matter how good of a job you have, if you aren't alive anymore to do it. So like you said, when you're ready, you've just got to take that first step; whether that's opening up to family/friends and asking for help, or going to a MAT clinic, going to rehab, etc. That first step can be different for everyone. But that's where it starts. And once you take that step, like you said, that's when recovery begins.",3,t3_1lovska

I'm on day 10 clean off IV fen after a 6 year habit, began 10 years ago. I've relapsed trying to quit many, many times. 

This brings me to ask myself what was so wrong with me that the pain and suffering was ever worth it.  Only living to chase something to be well and not even get ""high"" after time. I was never whole to begin with, opiates gave me that happy feeling from my bloodline, too. Eventually I found myself broken and more empty than when I started.

The lifestyle, risks and suffering of self and others is too much to fucking handle anymore. Watching people die, having to save lives, can't even use without a friend anymore because you need someone to bring you back if you fall out...  Now I'm even MORE fucking broken from losing family and then losing addict family... Too much loss and pain. We are in 2025 and as you said, the dope isn't the same. 

Not sure why I'm sharing this, wanted more so to say the misery was too much for me to carry on in it. 

Its better on this side, but to your point- thank you for posting this. I want to help others as well and hopefully someone can learn from me. This post inspires me to start writing again. I will document and collect the way I feel, to remind myself down the road when thoughts such as yours pop up. When the beast starts talking, i'll spark a blunt and reflect on the choice to quit and why I fight. So thank you again. 

I think its important to share these thoughts and reflect back on the decision and reason- pain, suffering and death for a small, temporary relief is not worth it. For me anyway. There's a hope in the fact we can live happily after the fact. Life does get better. Sharing our pain so others don't suffer the way we have, I have anyway.

So thank you for sharing all what you shared. I have lost many close friends to this drug. Most sane people would never use again or at the very least blame or resent heroin. But I don't. No, all of my friends died alone. They died alone in their childhood bedrooms, in their bathrooms, one even died alone on a rooftop. I resent the treatment of addicts, drugs charges prevent me from getting a job. While I'm sober and trying desperately to get my life together I've been rejected from 367/367 jobs because of two drug charges.

Anyways I can’t remember why but I decided to take 2  tablets. From memory I might have had a headache and mum used  to give us kids Panadol( 500mg formulation of Acetaminophen)  for it sometimes  .

3786,mig7pyg,1je6nnc,A junkie's creed,[deleted],"True but I turned my life around on fentanyl lol. I relapsed in the back of a rental, homeless, and in 3 years saved 20K, got a 401K, bought a paid off a used car, got it totaled by a non insured driver, then bought a 2024 a week later, got a pretty nice apartment, became a top worker at my job, raised my credit by 250 points and got 2 credit cards with decent lines of credit, and now I'm almost finished with my GED. 

Keep in mind I was top of my class when I showed up though. Coming from a broken home and being the only voice of reason in it, I found comfort in opiates and used them as a way to stay even and balanced, not obliterated and chasing a high that doesn't exist.

I read recently that having alcoholic parents, despite whether they stayed sober during your conception and birth can cause a natural Beta-Endorphin deficiency which explains why children of alcoholics tend to gravitate toward alcohol or opiates. We literally have a deficiency lmao. It makes sense to me. People often say, ""opiates made me feel like I found the missing peice"" Well yeah, because those peices are literally missing. 

I think this is why countries that legalize opiates got it right. People love who I am on opiates, they just don't realize it because i am forced to hide it due to the stigma, but to me it's medication, not a drug. I'm not knocking sobriety for anyone who loves it. But if you're here after 10 years of sobriety, then it's hard for me to believe it really gets better lol.

I avoided Subs like this when I was still actively using because why would I want to waste time deluding myself into believing I wasn't a bit more cheerful and motivated for life when I know it's gonna be a sub full of people decades clean still chasing the glory days through their own memory? Instead I was living my life and enjoying it.

That's kinda what inspired this post.. I call it ""a junkies creed"" because we're all junkies, whether you use opiates or not. I think this is why so many intelligent, resourceful people are among the junkie community. We see through the things from the start to then end without having to experience them to see what's gonna happen. We know what we're motivated by in life and don't recieve as much pleasure as ""normal"" people do, hence how we became intelligent in the first place. We got bored easily and needed more of a rush, that inadvertently led us to chase our own reward system, a system where the cheese of the maze is endorphins. Alcoholics do the same thing. So does just about any other addict. But so ""regular"" people, but they either had stable, loving homes, mentors, etc, and never experienced the level of trauma and violence we did, or they lived long enough to build a life like that and escape their own memories and experiences, without ever knowing of a ""shortcut"". 

The real trick is to build a life so full of natural endorphins release that opiates lose their purpose, or inadvertently become a wrench in the spokes of the vehicle it drives: Yourself. 

I realize what I'm saying is a bit of a contradiction, but such is opiate addiction, and really life itself. I guess I'm just putting it all out there, and what you get out of it is up to you and your perception, or goals. I'd rather be transparent though, and say how I feel, share my real feelings and experiences and at the very least someone out there will relate and know that how they feel isn't a solitary experience. No matter what I say, I'm determined to get away from it all, but I'd by lying if I didn't share how I feel at the moment",8,t1_mig5sw3
3791,mijy4bq,1je6nnc,A junkie's creed,[deleted],"That's the realization that led me to get away from it. I literally dug myself out of homelessness and wound up doing better than some people who've never even touched drugs. A small minority of people, but it was small win for me to realize what I was capable of. I truly don't know if I could have done it without opiates, and that's just me being transparent. I'm not saying I couldn't have, just that I'll never know because that's not how it went. 

BUT... I realized that the things I truly want. The abstract things of importance, like love, real trust in relationships, true friendships, a family, maybe even some children or a lasting career, getting back into school, making music that really means something to me, and just generally experiencing life and the world? I couldn't experience those things and participate in them the way a person is supposed to, or at least strives to. It really hit me when I went to a concert with a girl I've known since high-school and I felt like I was just apart of the scenery. I had to force myself to really get into the music and experience everything, and literally had to prepare lines on a folded up card to snort while I was standing right next to her. Trying to figure out a way to do it so she wouldn't see. 

The whole night revolved around figuring out a way to keep up my habit, which is usually microdosing bumps once every hour or 2 throughout the day and half a bag to sleep, too quarters once hour after hour when I woke up. Dope became my clock, and time became the enemy. I had to basically just risk oding so I could do it without her knowing, yet drive too so she wouldn't think anything was strange, because as close to nodding as I was, of she drove and I sat, not only would I feel like it would put pressure on her to not drink and have a good time, but I'd nod tf out in less than 5 mins if I had nothing to do and probably ramble about nothing, thinking everything I'm saying is a bar. 

There were many instances like this, where I appreciated spending real time with real people, but in the back of my mind I was always thinking, ""when am I gonna start to feel like shit?"" How long can I keep up this act before the feeling turns to anxiety and chills? So even if people wanted to spend time I never really bothered, I was too caught in my own self made cell and I decorated tf out of that cell, had all the commissary you could get on canteen, even a TV, but I never bothered with the wreck room, too afraid to leave the cell, that I became the cell.",5,t1_mijo2qa
3792,mih2cjr,1je6nnc,A junkie's creed,[deleted],"I'm new to it too, so we'll  be new together lol. New now so we can look back when we're old and say ""wow...I remember when I wrote that, boy has shit changed"" and I'm betting in the best way possible. 

I was against NA for a long time because I wanted to hear positive, reinforcing shares all the time. I became so used to using to be able to illicit that vibe from myself in order to uplift others, but people become so depenant on that vibe, that in an essence, they're dependent on your dependence, without even realizing it, and if they do, they don't want to realize it, just like we don't want to realize that vibe is all manufactured. It's a grieving process imo. While you're grieving who you thought you could be, so is everyone around you, even the people who wanted you to change. 

That's the biggest mindfuck of it all for me. The same people who begged me to get clean, are the first ones to get upset when I'm not Mr. Invincible anymore. It's been a justification for me to go back countless times, but in the end, it's really me that ends up missing it the most. Can't count how many times I relapsed and was told ""you just have a glow about you when you're clean, this is the guy I missed"" while I'm literally on opiates, but told by those same people ""you are not yourself"" when I'm pushing through withdrawls, or even 2-3 months clean. 

It really made me realize that part of the reason I depended so much on opiates was because so many people depended on me. It's pretty unfair to have to take on the role of the adult as a child, and essentially play father to your own mother or brother. I felt opiates gave me an edge, but ironically it wasn't until after my brother was gone, and my mother wasn't coming home after work that I really got into them full time. Maybe that void of purpose led me to it, maybe it's physiological. I really don't know for sure, but at the moment I'm just focused on never going back to fentynal. If 4mg of methadone keeps it that way, I can't shame myself for that. Even if it took it for the rest of my life, fuck it. I don't plan to, but it's not off the table, because I planned on using fentynal for the rest of my life too, the problem was the fentynal seemed to want me rested; for life. 

It's a process though, and more emotionally than some people give it credit for. Sure it's physical, that's a big part of it, but I really feel alot of it comes down to emotions and memories, so writing helps me to examine those facets of the addiction and just my life in general",5,t1_migz6mb
3793,milv2ma,1je6nnc,A junkie's creed,[deleted],"True, and that's why I'm having such a hard time with maintenance. Even though I'm such a low dose, it makes me feel like I'm just satisfying the urge to do opiates, but for free. 

At the same time, the lower I go, the more I feel my body paying the price, even though I'm becoming more aware emotionally, even sharper mentally.

I'm caught in this crossroads of, is my 3 year run catching up with me? Or am I just feeling the effects of methadone withdrawal from tapering so fast? 

And with opiate withdrawal, it's so random in its physical and emotional manifestations. You have to relearn how to deal with emotions and physical pains but differentiating which one is the primary cause is such a dicey situation. Suddenly I have to eat 2-3 times as much, go to the bathroom twice as much, sleep twice as much and motivate myself to get up without anything forcing me to get up (aside from the clinic) 

Idk man. It's just such a weird situation to me, and it doesn't help that I've always been the type of person to do everything in my power to will my way through things even before opiates, opiates just made that approach less painful. I'm trying hard to be honest with myself while at the same time, literally being fed an opiate every morning.

My hope is to stay at a low dose for long enough to where i can get a week or 2 worth of take homes and start playing with a micro-reduction method using a syringe to measure .25-.5 reductions and see how that goes, but the longer I stay on maintenence, the more difficult it will be. 

It seems like no matter what you do, you gotta pay up, either slowly and less severe over time, or fast and severe, but then it's over.",2,t1_milqx6t
3794,mihstnk,1je6nnc,A junkie's creed,[deleted],"But that's the thing. There was a time when people were prescribed a low dose of some sort of opiate for natural pains in life. For me, I first realized how much opiates helped me a few years after being diagnosed with scoliosis and never using the brace recommended. I was about 11-12 years old, and the social pressure of fitting in, just made me not want to take on anything that would make me stick out, but around 14-16 that lower back pain really started to surface. I had the hardest time just sitting through class, and this was around the same time tensions peaked in my household. 

 A combination of the two separate sources of pain was instantly solved the first 2.5 mgs of oxy I ever did. I kept thinking, wow. This is a miracle, but I would definitely get addicted to this, so I avoided it. I tried just about every class of drug you could think of as a teen, but never really felt compelled to use any of them consistently. Only alcohol and opiates ever really gave me any sort of real pain relief,  but alcoholism decimated my family, and killed all 3 of my mother's brothers. Watching that made me kind of develop a built in, reflex of never drinking more than a few drinks and maybe twice a month or on special occasions at most, but still never alot.

This is why it's hard for me to know if my use was for physical benefit or for emotional reprieve, especially since the two tend to potentiaite each other. I guess I just kinda wish the opiate epidemic never took place. The people i used with always looked at me and kinda laughed at the way I used. Always with extreme caution and never more than I had to. I figured, if I can't enhance my life, then what's the point? I looked at it as a tool, not a weapon for self harm. Fentynal, of course changed that to an extent, since it's much harder to determine quality, quantity and potency, but somehow I made it work for 3 years. It was cheap, effective, but almost too effective, because I really thought, ""why even stop at this point?"" 

If I could have just walked into a store though, and said ""Yeah I'll take a prescription for 90 5mg oxycodone, no tylenol"" and popped 3 a day, I would have just done that. I worked with what I had at the time, but to me the opiate game has, and will always be about taming your tolerance. 

We all probably started with a miniscule amount and got more satisfied from that than whatever amount we progressed toward, and it makes perfect sense when you realize how the brain works and how these receptors switch off over time since all the hardwork is being done for them, but once that happens tolerance occurs and the effectiveness wears off, and that's why I always would force myself to wait as long as possible between uses and use as little as possible. 

That led me to realize, that what I was essentially doing was self admisntering my own opiate prescription without a doctors direction lol. And that's why I finally said fuck it, and just went on the lowest dose of maintenence possible. It's as close as I'm gonna get to pain management In the US era of an opiate epidemic, and I'm sure no pain management clinic would take me seriously with a bunch of programs and detoxes on my medical record. If only I had saught treatment for the scoliosis pain before self medicating, but again, maybe I'm just bullshiting myself? It's hard to really say at this point, especially after being told I'm an addict like 1,000's of times by people in the rehabilitation industry and NA",2,t1_mihmj9o
3795,miokphn,1je6nnc,A junkie's creed,[deleted],"I figured most would, at least on this sub. I've had conversations like this dozens if not hundreds of times with other junkies. It got to the point where I hated that it was relatable, and I was tired of being freinds with other junkies just to watch them bottom out and destroy everything in their lives, it was too much of a reminder of the reality of my own potential future. 

It's such a love/hate relationship. You hate to love it, it hates you back, but loves you when you try to leave. I think one of the most accurate potryals of opiate addiction I've ever heard was two separate songs for different reasons 

Opium by Marcy Playground

Baltimore Love Thing by 50 Cent

The first one really describes the numb content followed by the scary realization of how bad it can go so quick almost out of nowhere, then followed by what I'd assume is a relapse or the relief of almost dying but stealing back life like nothing even happened. 

And the second one really takes on a perspective of it I've never really considered much. It's such a strong and accurate portrayal of the drug speaking to you, that I've literally relapsed listening to it while trying to detox myself",2,t1_min7ww0
3796,mis34xq,1je6nnc,A junkie's creed,[deleted],"But your on a partial agonist tho, so no offense, but you don't miss it because it never totally left you lol. You just became used to the subs. Still though, even on subs you're regularly getting a higher level of endorphins and dopamine than the average person. That's how I lived on fentynal. I was level 90% of the time, the only time I felt it was when I woke up, when I had to motivate myself to do things I really didn't feel like doing, but had to for my own benefit and the benefit of people I love, and sometimes on a day off once I forced myself to use the bare minimum and had nothing to do on a Monday or Tuesday.  Me personally, I just enjoyed have the control to change my level of motivation on a dime, even if I didn't use it right away. It was comforting to know I could",1,t1_mir7y80

I couldnt do anything but be a hardcore junkie living for H. But When fent came around i liked it and used regularly clearly because i enjoyed it and had no choice but fent isnt as good as heroin. I got locked up and when i got out i got back on fent 45 minutes after getting home. However i figured i needed to make a life if i wanted to get high whenever and with fent i was able todo just that. I was able to start a business, brought my credit from 580 to 750 , and live life normal. I bought a 2024 corvette,  my own house. A boat, got an amazing girlfriend who i met while still on fent who supported me snd stuck by my side and never judged me even tho she was mad i initially didnt tell her i used. My business does 300k a year. I started it in 2019. I used street dope for 8 years and IV for 6.5/7 starting about 2015. 

BUT 5 months ago i started a month long fent taper and finally quit the needle and street dope and jumped to percs and roxies. I only use pharma oxy now. Ill eventually taper this shit as well and even tho its very costly its much easier to manage. Which is why i havent tapered yet. But anyway i do admit heroin was way harder to maintain and i was always so compulsive. I could never get enough and thought it was the greatest thing in the world. It hits different receptors and for some reason i could not be a functional addict on heroin but i was able to on fent. I find it weird.",1,t1_mig7pyg

But also, it didnt, because i relapsed when my mom died & i was seven months preg. Being pregnant didnt stop me. But me almost killing myself and my bby by sleeping thru my placenta rupturing, bleeding for up to 12 hours- that was made me stop. My mom had died, i almost selfishly joined her & i realized then i needed to get help and i begged for it- and stuck to it. But it took me a LONG time to realize that just because i figured it out- i cant force someone to listen and learn from my mistakes. All i can do is tell them my awful story, take my judgements when my day comes & hope to god that it can save someone too.

Subs keep you out of withdrawals and that's pretty much all. There's supposed to be some effect on curbing cravings but I never felt it has had much effect in that regard, particularly compared to methadone. 

Whatever benefit there is to subs I think the more important factor is just time. Literally the longer you go without the more those cravings start to diminish, whether or not you're on maintenance it still works the same way.",1,t1_mis34xq
3805,misdc0c,1je6nnc,A junkie's creed,[deleted],"Fentynal mainly effects NDMA receptors. It levels your mood and judgment for some reason, at least that's how it effected me. I was able to just push everything that wasn't relevant for the moment to the side and see clearly what mattered for my goals and what didn't. It made me get out of bed, and helped me enjoy the little time I had between working. BUT only when I was able to get real fent. Where I am, that's pretty rare. It came around last November and I stocked up for like 3-4 months and weened down to space it out but it hit me so hard I could barely move at work, luckily I work alone so things didn't completely break down but regardless most of my success was based purely on luck if I'm being totally honest. There were so many occurrences where I could have easily died or killed someone since I drive for a living. Everything caught up and I skimmed a guardrail but got the benefit of the doubt by everyone. ""He works too much"" blamed it on too much caffeine after 5pm since we work til 7-8 sometimes even 9-10 and I was working 5 days sometimes 6 days a week. Caffeine basically became my grand leveler lol. 

Honestly though, that close of a call just woke me up...for about 10 hours then I was back at it, but was gonna be safe this time...👀  lol. Did the same thing the next week but this time I somehow got away with it. Decided fuck this, I gotta cash in my chips while I'm still up. So here we are lol. I'm not wild about maintenence but at the same time that's what I was already doing. It's been 10 days since I did dope and I'm still pissing dirty for benzos, there was barely any Fentynal even in my system when initially dosed at the clinic, probably because of my 45 days taper from 5 bags to crumbs before hand and trying to bridge to oxies but knowing I would just end up dependent on oxies if I didn't go on the clinic. I'm trying to just take it a day at time and I go back to work soon, so we'll see how it all goes I suppose.

My goal was like yours tho, use fent until i have enough money and go to tech skill to seal career i could get wealthy from. Get wealthy then quit as comfortable as possible, and I kind of just accepted that dying was a possibility. It was a risk I was willing to take because I had no better alternatives. ""Get busy living or get busy dying"" lmao",1,t1_miqyz3w
3806,mijviu7,1je6nnc,A junkie's creed,[deleted],"Yeah fentynal sucks, I mean for pain relief it's pretty top notch lol, but the street stuff isn't really that good, or consistent in quality or potency, even the pharmaceutical grade patches were way more than I ever needed, so I avoided them even though I could get a 50mcg patch for like 10$ back in 2010. Nobody wanted them. Fentynal was actually the first opiate that opened me up to using opiates as a lifestyle rather than just recreationally. 
 
When I was Introduced to opiates it was always small lines of like a perc 5 or 10 or a vicodin, but it was always prepared crushed so I just did it that way. It wasn't until I was tapering off fentynal that I realized I got more out of oxycodone by just swallowing it. the effect was more consistent and pain relief based than about hitting a ceiling just to come crashing down worse and in more pain than I began with.

I definitely think pharmaceutical grade opiates, at a mild dosage, have a place in the world as a means to end for people in legitimate pain, but where it becomes confusing is when you realize it doesn't just kill physical pain, but emotional pain too. At that point you start to wonder, what pain am I really taking this for?",3,t1_mijs1s6
3807,mioo15j,1je6nnc,A junkie's creed,CheetohVera,Yep. The most dangerous thing about addiction and opiates is experiencing them during the war on drugs and in a capitalist hell hole.,3,t1_mihuwpx
3808,mivlpzk,1je6nnc,A junkie's creed,[deleted],"Yeah again, because you're satisfying those receptors. I'm not knocking it, but let's be real, the only way you could know that for sure is if you're off the subs. Like I have zero cravings right now, but I'm not naive. I'm replacing one opiate with another. And I did the same thing with kratom, which is also a partial agonist like subs are. It's not like I crave fentynal when I'm on fentynal or crave oxy when I'm on oxy lol. No one does, but with maintenence you know you're straight for as long as you want, so you don't even think about getting sick, which is the only thing that really motivates addiction after you become physically dependant",1,t1_mivky2z
3809,mivmuz3,1je6nnc,A junkie's creed,makhnovite,"Well I disagree a bit, the motivation is complex and for a fully dependent addict avoiding getting dope sick is a major part of it. But you’re still always chasing that high as well, that’s why people relapse after years of being clean. Even on subs I had major cravings at first and they came back quite hard after being given opioids for surgery, a few years ago I’d have probably relapsed by having been clean for years it just doesn’t have the same hold over me.

When I first went on subs I relapsed hard within a few months and wound up switching to methadone.

Have you tried suboxone? It’s nowhere near as strong as fentanyl, nor straight bupe.",1,t1_mivlpzk
3810,mivnkz3,1je6nnc,A junkie's creed,[deleted],"Suboxone has the longest half life of any medical opiate lol. It makes sense you relapsed when you first when on it, most people do, but overtime you realize, why even bother going through all that, when I can just take subs, pretty much for free, or a low copay, and never have to deal with dealers and running out of money? 

Again man, who cares really. Whatever gets you away from the skid row. But if they opened up a heroin, or oxy clinic that let you walk I'm everyday and do it how you felt, and you could eventually earn take homes for weeks or a month at a time, you still think you'd choose subs? Maybe at this point since you're used to it. But my point is it's still an opiate. If you lost access to subs tommarow, you'd most likely have ""cravings"" 2-3 days in

There's no shame in that either, do whatever u gotta do to stay away from dope or ""oxies"" these days. The gamble is way too high, and most people have to OD just to gain a tolerance",1,t1_mivmuz3

I’m not ashamed either that’s not my point, I’m saying that it takes time for the cravings to diminish, and they do eventually diminish. Coz it’s not just about staying out of withdrawals with opiates, the reason people relapse even once they’re clean is that they’ve craving the high. The longer you stay away the less power that memory of the high has, the less it has a hold over you mentally. This shouldn’t be controversial.

What’s the longest you’ve gone without fent or oxy or anything like that? Coz maintaining on fast acting opioids, even being on methadone, is extremely different to being on bupe and naloxone.",1,t1_mivnkz3
3813,miw2z87,1je6nnc,A junkie's creed,[deleted],"I've been on just about every opiate there is lol. I've spent the most time on oxys, and fentynal, but had a good 6 month run with heroin when it was still heroin. 

I get what your saying, I just know that for me personally, anything involving an endorphin release can easily trigger memories of opiates. Something as simple as the spring Sun after winter is over, or sex. A nice hot shower. It all releases Beta-Endorphins. 

The way I got sober the longest was to excercise, drink coffee when I felt I needed a quick endorphin rush to motivate me, and avoided unnecessary sugars and processed foods, that way if I was having a really rough time I could use those things to satisfy the urge. Eventually, yeah over time you learn to live without opiates and almost forget the high, but in my personal experience, that only happens when you stop feeding your brain synthetic endorphin release. 

We're not so much addicted to opiates and Endorphins as we are addicted to the control. Even if you just maintain on opiates and never get ""high"" it doesn't mean those receptors aren't being fed synthetically. 

Ask anyone who spent time on maintenence who is clean today, they'd most likely tell you they look back and don't consider maintenence as ""clean"" time. They only really understand the huge difference once they're off maintenence. But for sure you can learn to reinforce healthy habits and priorities if you've never done that due to your addiction and this will reinforce you to get off maintenence when your ready and willing.

I guess my point is that sooner or later, the sickness will resurface alot of thoughts and urges  you haven't had or knew where still in you to even have once you start to taper off maintenence and it will stick with you for a while because the crutch is gone. 

People who claim they don't get high on subs? I'm sorry man, but I got higher off of subs then I do the low dose of methadone I'm on, but it makes sense because the conversation rate is 7.5 meaning an 8mg sub = 60mgs of methadone to achieve the same effect.

I'm on 5mgs daily of methadone which would be about 0.6 of suboxone. However people choose to stay away from their DOC is their business though, and should be celebrated and encouraged regardless. Every day spent not gambling a life is a day won imo",1,t1_miw0y37

3816,ma9jvwb,1ien71u,Feeling sorry for yourself.,red_neck_beard,"41M and I've pissed away half my life and almost all my potential. I've had serious guilt and shame for the people I've hurt. When I was a kid my cousins lived with their mom who was a terrible and manipulative person and a lifelong addict. My uncle got custody and because of something I did he lost custody. So my cousins didn't even have a chance at a good life and are super fucked up. I still carry that shit with me but I have a good relationship with one of them. I called my best friend when he was in his motorcycle, he answered and immediately wrecked and died instantly. I still hear the wind whipping on the phone call and then the phone made the weirdest sound when it cut out. I still hear it. The worst is I made friends with this crazy old marine. He lived on my property for awhile. I really liked him, a good friend. He would never talk shit and tease like men do. He was always uplifting and saying something nice and positive. It was so refreshing and really made me think about how we as people talk to each other. This one really fucks with me and I'll carry the guilt forever. The property wasn't mine and he didn't leave for a long time. So it created a bunch of problems with my landlord and my wife at the time was annoyed as shit by him being around all the time. So he eventually had to leave. That's not where the guilt comes from. He came back around to say hi a couple years later. He had a newborn son. We became fast friends again for the next few years. He was so happy to have a kid but he had problems with his baby momma. He was crazy, I wasn't exaggerating, but I've never seen him scary crazy. Never seen him violent or thought he could be violent. Dude was big and he told a story about getting arrested and how he resisted arrest, wouldn't let them cuff him basically. He didn't fight the cops or anything. So that was the closest I've ever heard or seen him being violent or whatever. He adored his son and he took care of her and her kids. Well she was turning against him. Using the incident with the cops and claiming he was threatening or threatening to get him on DV. I don't fully know what happened but he got kicked out of the house. He shows up at my place. Middle of summer and it gets triple digits where I live. He had the look in his eyes I've seen before. He was manic. I'm sure he was freaking out because she was using the kid against him. He asked to use my phone to call her. Guess he broke his. No problem use my phone. I had her number in my phone because I knew them both and they would vacation where I work and I would take my kids to his house too. We lived a couple hours away from each other. He looked surprised that her name came up when he dialed her number. He was hella manic tho and dude was kinda crazy anyways. He called her and I was talking to him after about what was going on. He said he got kicked out. I'm pretty sure he was trying to ask if he could stay with me. Because of how it went down before I kinda panicked. My reaction wasn't super bad but it wasn't a good reaction. I asked him if he needed a place to stay. He said no and took off. Idk if it was cuz I had her in my contacts or most likely because of my reaction when he told me she kicked him out. He left and 2 or 3 days later he died of heat stroke living in his car while it was 100 degrees outside. I'll carry it with me for the rest of my life. 

I ruined my cousin's lives. There's no guarantee they would have had it better if they stayed with my uncle but they would have had a chance at least. I didn't make my friend answer his phone on his motorcycle but if I didn't call him then and there he would still be alive. With the last one with the ex marine I still break down and cry about it. There is so much I wish I would have done said or reacted differently. It will haunt me for the rest of my life. I don't feel like I killed him, she killed him. But I sure as shit could have saved him. Now his son grows up without a dad.  The whole situation is fucked. I don't want to engage with his ex but I owe it to him to have a relationship with his son so at least down the road I can tell him what a great guy his dad was. I've talked to her once and I've seen the son once since it happened. I never cried so hard after seeing his son. Now that I'm clean and getting my shit together I'm going to try and have a relationship with the son.

The only good that can come from mistakes is when we learn from them. Some mistakes there is no lesson, which sucks. My guilt and shame don't weigh me down anymore tho.

3820,mah9try,1ien71u,Feeling sorry for yourself.,wearythroway,"Regret and guilt and shame all go together. One thing that i found very helpful was working on an inventory of the suffering caused by my addiction. Obviously alot of that was caused by things that i wish i hadnt done/or wish i had. Writing it down, honestly, was really painful. When i shared it with my counselor, it was just like setting down the heaviest burden i could imagine. By admitting to myself all the bad things ive done, all the ways ive fucked up and suffered, and by letting it outside of my own head, it took away the power of that guilt and shame. Ive had the experience of being in a group of other people with addictions, and letting out my deepest secrets that ive judged myself for. Things i cant believe im admitting to out loud. And then i see the head nods, and one person says 'i can relate' and others say 'yeah ive done that too'. 

And then as im able to let go of the guilt shame and regret, im able to move past it. What happened, already happened, and those moments are gone now. The only thing that exists is right now, and thats the only place that i have any agency. I can learn from what happened in the past to do my best Right Now.

That instead of doing something to make up for lost time, or learning to better appreciate the time I *do* have, I decided to go ahead and waste MORE time about it.

3883,n42ghu1,1m2ie9h,Relapse incoming,Roxannex97,"Yep, came here to say this.

The drug scene is not at all what it was 6 years ago. You will not find heroin, nor legit pills. It’s all fentanyl and other weird shit. As a recovering addict (2 years as of today actually!) who started with heroin and ended with fentanyl, it’s not the same feeling or experience, at all. The odds are high that you would OD immediately. 

That feeling you’re looking for doesn’t exist anymore. It won’t be anything like what you’re remembering or hoping for. It’s simply not worth it.
You’ve come so far, don’t throw everything away, especially not for the shit that’s out there now. You absolutely can find a job as a felon. I’d be happy to help you look, feel free to DM me.

Using won’t fix any of your problems, it would only make them worse- or more likely, just kill you.

Wishing you the strength and perseverance needed to continue on your path of growth without straying. 🙏🏼",1,t1_n3qrs3x

Do you get the desire to watch comedy or funny videos and laugh your ass off and then for whatever reason cry from awe or the beauty of the world? I got that a few times in early acute withdrawal. 

Last time I went through withdrawal (clean for 4 years 6 months now) it also completely reset my sense of smell and removed my nose blindness to what the world actually smells like for a couple days. (It stinks! lol) 

Also at one point my brain reset too and for a couple of days I gained the ability to day dream full on sitcoms that had a plot and were funny af that I’d just lay in bed and watch in my head. Or alternatively was able to listen to amazing music compositions in my head. 

I think it can go farther than that tho because I seen one guy in rehab go through quite the bout of acute psychosis from withdrawal (fent-benzo) and he ended up believing and saying the craziest funniest things. At one point he took off in the middle of night in a snow storm because he thought through the power of thought alone he had ripped the roof of his room off lol. he got scared we’d all be mad at him lol.

This might feel like a near-miss, and maybe it was. But you didn't go through with it. And further, you came here to tell us about it and get some support. You also gave yourself some accountability. People who care that you chose sobriety even though it was hard. Even though you almost didn't. I know that two years on, it's easy to feel like nobody cares. I care. I actually care a lot. 

Now, there's a next step though. This may have worked out okay ish this time. But it's also pretty clear that you're needing some extra support. A phone call to set up some therapy for yourself would be extra smart. Or get your ass to a meeting. Set up some guard rails for yourself, you know? Reach out to someone IRL who is in a position to offer you support and accountability.

I’d always love when the crack was out then the fetty would completely wash that depression away but when I had a tolerance it did absolutely nothing but keep me well, so I’d have to rely on plastic bottle vodka to wash that depression away. 3 years that was every single day and I do not miss it.

I think that'll help. A meeting would probably help. A therapist definitely will. You can reach out to me by DM if you need to. 

As you get more solid and stable in your sobriety, you might feel more comfortable mentioning it in your life. I know you probably just cringed so hard at that idea, but, hear me out. It took me several years. I'm a dozen plus years out, and at this point, if it comes up naturally in conversation, I'll freely admit that I don't mess with opiates, cuz it was a problem for me. For many reasons. First, maybe I can help somebody else. Second, ""outing"" yourself as previously had a problem is another way to set some guard rails up in your life. If the people around you know that these things used to be problematic for you? You'll be more likely to stick on the straight and narrow, cuz you know that people are watching. Third, the more honest and forthright you are about it? The less isolation, shame, etc, you're feeling. Other people will come and tell you about their journey. You might get some sober friends out of it. I'm not saying you have to go ""out"" yourself to everybody right away. Just that maybe consider not hiding it quite so hard? You'd be shocked how many people have had a problem with one thing or another. Or have a close friend or family member who did.

I quit for 11 1/2 months (years ago), but did relapse.  I've tried to quit several times before, but haven't made it to 3 months yet, each time was due to the lack of sleep. There's not much worse than trying to sleep at night and doing nothing but staring at the walls. I will say that in my 11+ months I was clean, I forced myself to get in exercise. Mainly cardio and threw a few low weights in there. After the 5th month or so, my body had adjusted and I was able to sleep again.

I just found out that my hubby (who pointed me in the direction of this sub) has been struggling with opiates for about the last 8 years. It was a shock to find out, because I had absolutely no idea, so I hope you don't mind me asking, but what have been your biggest challenges in the first few months? My hubby said to me that he struggles with looking for help, because he didn't feel he ""deserved"" it, and that the heavy feelings of shame involved kept him from asking. Other than me, no-one else knows. I'm glad to hear that you have been able to move forwards and release yourself from the feelings of guilt and shame. That sounds really freeing.

I've been taking magnesium and B6 and it helps me get REM sleep so the quality of sleep I'm getting has improved. The super random dreams are kind of fun too. I definitely need to exercise more I just can't go for very long at a time but it is slowly getting better. I feel you on how shitty it is when trying to sleep and staring at the walls. First month and a half all I did was toss and turn all night. I would get delirious from the lack of sleep and if you aren't sleeping you aren't healing. It would get unbearable and then I would sleep a few hours every once in awhile and it was just enough to keep me going. I definitely don't miss that. Wish you the best and thanks again,2,t1_ma5amnz
3976,ma51xoc,1ie5ror,3 months clean off fentanyl,red_neck_beard,"I did a homemade medical detox lol for acute withdrawal. No MAT but I take bupropion for depression. For supplements I take vitamin C and magnesium and vitamin B6. Mentally and emotionally I'm doing good but physically I'm not fully back. Still don't sleep worth a shit and low energy. Mag and B6 help me get REM sleep, have the most random dreams but what little sleep I'm getting is more refreshing than before I was taking those supplements.

I got tired of killing myself and by the end it wasn't a slow suicide anymore. Being ready helped but I'm so thankful somebody suggested NA. It is making all the difference for me and literally saved my life",3,t1_ma50cbk
3977,ma5oedz,1ie5ror,3 months clean off fentanyl,red_neck_beard,The first time I detoxed I did cold turkey off of blues. Worst 5 days of my life but day 6 I slept like a baby and was almost back to %100. I've never even heard of that happening to anyone else. The second time was 3 months ago. I basically did a homebrew medical detox. I'm gonna try and get some sleep but if you want to know exactly what I did I can tell you in the morning. I live in WA state and over here there are a few medical detox facilities and online clinics for medical detox and Suboxone. There are options. Cold turkey from fentanyl is so terrible that most people can't handle it. I don't know how I did it off of blues before. I guess I did a quick taper before I tried. In about 5 days to a week I cut my usage to a third of what I was doing before and I still don't know how I made it through. I stayed clean for about 6 months and thought I would get some oxy 30's for my bday. They didn't do shit and before I knew it I was doing fentanyl again but instead of blues I was snorting powder. I wanted to quit the whole time I was doing the powder but I was so scared of the detox I never tried to quit. I was only able to quit when I cobbled together some meds that I thought would help and they worked just enough to get me thru it but it was just barely. There are options out there if you are trying to find a way out of it or off of fentanyl. It's not easy and unfortunately there isn't a way to detox without withdrawal. There are options to help make the withdrawal doable at least. My ex went to a good detox facility and I never thought she would get clean. She would have seizures in jail and shit. She was living in the gutter and was deep into it. She went to the detox facility and now is in some hippie inpatient place that she really likes and is right up her alley. There is hope. I'm gonna try and get some sleep but if you have questions or anything hit me up. I will respond in the morning for sure or if I can't sleep I'll get back to you,1,t1_ma5l5q2
3978,ma7vj31,1ie5ror,3 months clean off fentanyl,red_neck_beard,"Thank you. I'm glad your husband opened up to you. The saying goes secrets make us sick. I always struggled with depression and self worth. Not feeling worthy was always a big deal for me. The pitfalls while staying clean depend on the person but it's really what triggers somebody. A lot of addiction gets to the point that you're just numbing out from the pain or emotions in general. I think men in particular have a hard time with emotions because we're taught to see emotion as weakness. So a lot of men it seems like don't even know what it is they're feeling or why and that is scary. 

I really want to answer your question in a way that satisfies you but I haven't had my coffee yet and I'm finding it difficult right now. What I really want to say to you though isn't about what to avoid. The challenges are many and focusing on them idk how much it helps. For me it's not about what I'm not doing to stay clean, but what I am doing to stay clean. You guys have a pretty strong relationship for him to open up to you and for you to not freak out. Takes a lot of love and understanding from both of you. 

I've been writing this for awhile now and I think I'm beating around the bush because I don't want to be off putting but I'm just gonna say it. I think what the challenges are might be the wrong question. To me the question is about what helps. You obviously want to help your husband and he's a very lucky guy to have your love in his life. If you're not an addict in recovery though the help you can offer him to go for recovery is minimal. Just your husband talking to you about his addiction or trying to explain it can trigger shame and guilt. Doesn't mean he shouldn't talk to you about it, but those discussions are probably better for your guys relationship than it is for his recovery. 

The biggest difference for me and why I feel I have a real chance at recovery and hope for my life is the NA program. Peer support has been invaluable for me staying clean. Just knowing that we addicts aren't alone is a big comfort. Being surrounded by people with totally different backgrounds but know exactly what I'm going through because they went through it too. The help care and advice I get from the fellowship of NA is saving my life. It also makes a big difference to know that there is a successful blueprint that I can follow. It's not easy but it's simplified. In meetings I've heard somebody say 100 times or more that you can come to meetings and stay clean but if you want to go after true recovery you have to do the 12 steps. Step work is serious. You get a sponsor and then you get a guide book. The book walks you through each step and it asks you a bunch of questions. The first step has the most questions at almost 70. It forces you to really look at yourself and clean out the closet.

There's a lot of different meetings and programs out there. In person or zoom meetings. If you really want to help your husband I would try and encourage him about getting in a recovery program. Just the peer support can make a huge difference. I've been lucky with my meetings. I live in a rural area so there are only NA or AA meetings, but I've been to every NA meeting I can except for 1 and there is only one meeting that I won't go back to. That meeting wasn't bad, it's just really big and chaotic and not my cup of tea. Every other meeting I really like though. So if your husband does want to check out a program I would suggest he goes to a lot of different meetings to check them out and see which ones he likes and would go back to. 

Dang I've been writing this for an hour lol. Hope it helps, wish you both the best. Your husbands struggles with shame, guilt, and worthiness are what we all struggle with. He's worth it and hopefully your love and understanding can help him feel that you both deserve his recovery",2,t1_ma6f3tb
3979,ma95ce6,1ie5ror,3 months clean off fentanyl,red_neck_beard,Thank you. I definitely don't want to get cocky. I know I don't got it figured out. My sponsor is a big biker dude. He said he isn't a hard sponsor and I told him if I needed someone on my ass I wouldn't do it. I told him I needed someone to check me when I got too big for my britches.

And yea that natural sleep is priceless and one of the most rewarding things. I underestimated the value of quality natural sleep. It does wonders for the body and your health.

It's definitely helped!",2,t1_ma7vj31
3983,ma5agd4,1ie5ror,3 months clean off fentanyl,red_neck_beard,"I do it in person. So I really like NA for a few reasons. First is peer support. You have to lose all your old friends and contacts, if you're lucky you gain some family back, but even most family don't know what it's like to be an addict or know what it is you really need. So I started going to meetings and I'm surrounded by people who have gone through the struggle and know exactly what I'm going through. It's a fellowship and a camaraderie and instead of doing it alone and on my own strength I have people who can help, who I can talk to, and most importantly are already living recovery. I also like the fact there is a proven blueprint for staying clean and being in recovery. I'm literally following in the footsteps of those who came before me. It's not easy and I'm sure it never will be, but it takes a lot of the noise out of it. Simplifies the process I guess. It's comforting that I know it has worked before. I'm lucky tho because I don't live in a big city so it's not like 80 people in a meeting. I can't even imagine what that would be like. I hit 5 meetings a week about and there's anywhere from 10-20 people in them. It seems like the perfect amount for me. You can share and listen and still get to know people. Some meetings I've gone to and I won't go back. Some can be kind of a shit show. But I've hit all but one meeting in my area and know which ones I want to go to.

With NA in one of the readings it says that basically the only thing that can hinder someone's benefit of the program is not being open to the spiritual principles. Some people think it's a religious program but it's a spiritual program. Some people believe in God but the basic wording is your higher power. The higher power of your choosing. So nobody has to agree on what the higher power is, just that we need a higher power to be successful. Something else I've heard a lot of people say in meetings is that when they first started coming to meetings they thought it was a cult and they would never drink the Kool aid. They had to come to meetings through drug court and just showed up to get their papers signed but those people are normally the ones who go the hardest for NA. It can seem like a cult I guess because we do the serenity prayer together in the beginning and at the end of meetings we circle up and there's another, I wouldn't call it a prayer but whatever it is we recite together. When I started and didn't know the words or even what the fuck was going on I felt kinda like an outsider but people are really welcoming and the words get learned in time. 

Long reply but you asked! Seriously tho you got clean and are staying clean and you're doing it on your own? That is really fucking impressive, you are a savage. That takes strength. 

If you're interested in checking out a program there are a lot of options other than NA. My ex is in inpatient right now and I guess she is doing some sort of offshoot of NA but with Buddhist principles. I don't know what that really means or looks like but she really likes it. There's SMART and other programs. Where I live it's only NA or AA but with zoom you can find any kind of meeting I'm sure. Congrats on getting off the shit and staying off it. You're awesome",3,t1_ma540v7

Everything you’re saying, including the things you’re just considering, should be celebrated, imo. The “return of feelings” really is *such* a roller coaster. Coming off of morphine, I remember the feelings very, very well.

The way you describe being affected by opioids (morphine) read like something I wrote myself. The stimulant-like motivation and productivity is what I enjoyed most. It’s also what kept me addicted. Obviously, upon discontinuation, the pendulum swings the other way. And I remember feeling like I could never have the same kind of enjoyment for life nor productivity without it. I now know how common that fear is, and the neurobiology behind it. And boy was I wrong.

Whether intentional or not, I hope this break is an opportunity to unburden yourself. No judgment whatsoever, but are you planning to keep this going? If so, do you have planned any new behaviors or support elements to guide you through this journey? Because if you do want to continue it, ime, you will *need* those things. Not just to “make it,” but to optimize everything about this situation for yourself. Fighting it with your own mind is usually a stalemate: limbic system vs. limbic system.

I suddenly care about things i didn't give a fuck about 13 days ago. For instance, today, i flipped shit on my partner for leaving snack wrappers on the end table in the living room. He was in complete shock, but he didn't get mad. His response: ""It's nice to see you actually care about the house being nice like you used to."" I've made more progress in my life/affairs in the last 2 days than i did in the last 2 months because I'm awake. Coherent and aware of every little thing i pushed to the side while using. It's overwhelming but also refreshing. I also just want to be happy and wish my brain was normal, but it isn't. Unfortunately, i damaged it by using drugs.

I am planning on keeping this up. My situation is unique. I’m currently undergoing chemotherapy, and I got addicted because I developed chronic pain. Now, I have basically lost opioid privilege, and I don’t blame them. It still makes me sad to think of how my medical team must see me. A junkie or somebody that just struggled to wean off properly?

Anyways, I have somewhat of a support system, but it’s not something I can really talk about with anyone I know. I am planning on finding some online support groups, and I need to start going to therapy again. I need to find healthier ways to gain motivation.

That it means that to you — reading that — it gave me a visceral warmth. So thank you for sharing that. I have been in recovery for about seven years now, and yes, I’m incredibly grateful for that. It was a long and lonely road before realizing I needed support. I’m sorry to hear of the circumstances around this for you. I’ve worked with people in different kinds of treatment, including chemotherapy, but I’ve not experienced that myself. It makes me sad that you’re concerned about what your treatment team thinks of you “morally.” They are medical professionals. 1) I think it’s unlikely they are judging you in that way; 2) *IF* they were, I’d worry about their professionalism and aptitude. Because if this is their area of medicine, and they lack experience or understanding around the function of opioid pain medication and human response — that’d represent some *alarming* ignorance within the medical community; 3) Perhaps the most important ability/practice for long-term recovery is shame-resiliency. Most people are awesome at imagining and then heaping shame on themselves that exists nowhere else. This is based on a lot of conditioning, projection, and long-held illogical beliefs. It’s not a coincidence that shame-resiliency is so strongly correlated to — not just long-term recovery — but happiness, and general well-being. It is an indispensable life skill that I’m so lucky to have acquired through recovery. 

Personally, I experienced a rather protracted period of anhedonia. A specific timeline is hard to nail down because the change was gradual, but I do know (from journaling) I had an experience just before six weeks in which I experienced real joy. This was an inflection point for me because it increased my hope, and commitment to healing. That “turnaround time” is different for everyone and based on many factors. You can also help expedite that process with practices that encourage neural repair and improve perspective and understanding.

Well done for reaching out I admire that. Lord knows I have been there alone enough times.
Your still young,,, I won’t presume to know is anything that I do not but if nothing else you have so, much, time,   Believe me when I say that many of us here would kill for those years to have to live, when we get better.

With good information, and with some support you can make life better. 

Please take one day at a time right now, once you can get some kind of stable, some calm, then the next step becomes easier to see.

Why not try letting us know your situation in regards to DOC, dosage, history, current situation and resources and I bet we can help,

Some great people here with loads of experience and people that care too.

I hope your day gets better 🙏 please hang in there there",4,t3_1i841v9
4005,m8qw3fh,1i841v9,I’m giving up. I don’t want to be here anymore.,Notoriousgod9210,"Have you thought about taking subs for a couple weeks just to get stable and buy some time?

If you don’t have access to subs Couple other unorthodox comfort meds to get through the first few weeks
1. 5-HTP
2. Gas station heroin (Tianeptine) - be careful w this one. Despite the nick name it received your body will still be kicking the dope while you’re taking this but only take it for the first week max then switch to Kratom. 
3. GABApentin at 2000 mg and redbull. When you mix 2000-3000 mg of GP with a large redbull it has an engergizing euphoric effect that will give you the energy to get off your ass which is usually super hard the first week. (Extreme circumstances call for extreme measures).
4. Colanidine - Blood pressure med - don’t take if you have low BP!  I personally thought this did me really well for sweats and cold/hot flashes but you have to be super careful. If you already have low BP only start with a super low dose. One time I took this I thought my heart was gonna stop. But there was other times where I wanted to die and then I took this and could actually relax a little bit. 
5. California Poppy - studies show it works. I don’t think I took enough
6. Loperamide - definitely works. You gotta take like 10-20 2 mg pills then drink orange juice and taurine energy drink like bawls…but again - can be very dangerous. I’ve done this atleast 10 times and had no issues besides 4 days of constipation but that’s a good thing the first week. If you do it make sure you only do it ONE TIME and the first week during the heaviest withdrawal. 
7. Trazadone - great for sleep you probably know this one.",8,t3_1i841v9

Give yourself a real chance after you stop “catastrophizing” from the rehab denial.  Millions have made it without rehab.  I’m once again tapering down after a 2-month flare-up (chronic pain from broken vertebrae).  It just sucks.  Loperimide 2-4mg (not 40! Jaysus!) and clonidine really help.  Atavan/Clonazapam for the anxiety.  Or edible cannabis which really helps me get to sleep at night instead of wide awake until 4-5am feeling like a bag of wasps.  Just for 1-2 weeks to get through the worst WDs. 
But most importantly don’t give up today.  Get to a meeting if that works for you (not me, too much glorifying of past binges) but no matter what give yourself some more time, you can beat this despite likely feeling hopeless right now.

Just nice to have people to talk to that actual have been though it and understand. I always feel like no one around me gets it. I don't expect them too but it's still hard.

I would be searching for people on reddit that are in your area that have some insight. Like maybe make a post about being from London and looking for services for addiction. There's no other resources? Here in U.S. there are multiple organizations to go to.  All sorts of resources here. I don't understand. :( so annoying. Its like yeah they give free healthcare to you guys but doesn't seem like it's anything good. Just the bare minimum and less than that. Because I see posts from people in your area that are struggling to find resources and it's just not fair. They make it hard here sometimes too but not like that.

It's never too late to do better than yesterday.. People who haven't been through a heroin / opioid addiction can't really understand; it's not their fault but they'll never know just how hard it is.

Have you tried to taper down at all? It's a difficult process, it requires patience but if you can find something healthy in your life to replace any enjoyment you may get from drugs; it's certainly possible to get clean basically with little external support (though it's hard and most people will prefer to get support via NA or get into detox).

It may seem impossible to be clean or happy from your current perspective but the future can be much better for you than the past 7 or more years.

If ur gonna take 5htp u should take it together with green tea extract that contains egcg, the ratio of it should be 1mg 5htp to 4mg of egcg.

It is to ensure 5htp crossing the blood brain barrier. If u dont do it, it goes straight to the hearth. Which can in turn put u at risk of developing serotonin syndrome. 

I would also advice taking l-tyrosine with it (with a ratio of twice the amount of 5htp). 5htp can deplete dopamine, l-tyrosine boosts production of dopamine.",3,t1_m8qw3fh

Also in my opinion I think the kratom works better. The tianeptine is actually more of an antidepressant at a lower dose. And then metabolizes to an opiate at a higher dose. It's a weird ass research drug that I don't trust, mostly because no one really seems to understand how it actually even works like that.

Edit: I see you said then switch to kratom, my bad, missed that part. Idk, I'd still just start with kratom. But i see what you're saying though bc the gas station tianeptine is probably gonna be the same amount of gamble as what can be ordered online. 

But the kratom ordered online is gonna be much more effective and legitimate than most gas station kratom. (Also I've gotten some weird ass blacklisted OPMS kratom pills before from a gas station, they worked ok until they made me feel like shit, like POISONED the next morning once they wore off. I've never had that issue with ordering kratom powder. And I've ordered from several different places.)",1,t1_m8qw3fh

Gabapentin and pregabalin are both rx only.

Same clonidine (I assume that’s what you meant).

Opium poppies are legal to grow in the UK for ornamental purposes. This isn’t an overnight thing, but seeds are readily available, so PST is an option but not really a solution.

Loperamide is an opioid that doesn’t cross the blood brain barrier at therapeutic doses. It will help with the shits, but at doses required to relieve WD there’s a risk of cardiotoxicity.

Trazodone, also rx only.

So you mean well I’m sure, but these aren’t really solutions. 5-HTP should be available as a supplement, but no guarantees of efficacy.

2 years of fentynal for me then a short 2 month stint of methadone at 10mgs, and im 85 days in.


Somedays I feel motivated, with enough energy to do the things I need to do, somedays all I wanna do is lay around and sleep. I'll feel so flat and low that getting pleasure out of anything feels pointless and simple tasks like cleaning feel overwhelming.


On the good days I feel good enough to work out a bit, even crack jokes or have a good conversation.

I finally realize how dumb it all is lol. I spent so much of my life blaming the drugs for being exactly what we all knew they were and not enough time asking myself why they ever seemed like a choice I should make.


I explored a lot of the trauma, upbringing, social, and even financial aspects of how I came to be me, and realized what drove my decision making. Ultimately I was trying to find peace, but that isn't something I eve got from compulsively obsessing over drugs. Its never something I got from doing the same with women, social relationships, money, status, the gym, any of it. 


I finally came to this realization that normal, at peace people dont obsess over those things, those things aren't just goals to attain, they're byproducts of a healthy mind and life. 


Id get clean and try to play catch up by forcing all these aspects of my life together in an effort of some sort of validation for myself and others, but I didnt don't organically and so the pressure would break me. Id ignore my own unhappiness and stress to keep the show looking good, but the insecurity would amplify and the denial of my own happiness would increase.


Dealing with PAWS which I was denial of while playing this game, just made it even more confusing and eventually id just cave into a relapse not even caring if I lived or died, probably subconsciously hoping I did.


Im not 100% myself again, maybe wont be for a long time, but ive made with the consequences, knowing its the last time ill ever have to deal with it",2,t1_nd31081

Ive reached about 7-8 months before, almost entirely over PAWS, at least to the point where I barely felt it when I did get minor moments of it. When I was that far in I would forget almost completely how bad things got. More importantly I was so deep in denial out of the shame of what I was, once I was seen as people knew I could be, that I struggled to recognize that even outside of PAWS, on the other side there will still be occasional mental and emotional challenges.


It took me a long time to appreciate the down times, and understand that not being able to accept them is often the nature of which addiction builds itself upon. 


I went through so much so young, that rather than process it, I saught quick fixes, anything that would distract me from how I felt. It may not have been my fault, or even fair, but ultimately its my life, and my responsibility to deal with and make worth living despite those hard times.  Ironically, accepting and processing those painful times was always waiting for me the whole time and its what made me see addiction for what it really is. And inability or refusal to deal with processing pain or confusion. 


With those healthy coping skills, it seems almost funny how much time I wasted. I used to look back or try not to look back out of horror, guilt and shame of the time I spent running in circles, but today, for the most part I just sort of laugh at how obviously pointless it was lol. I just gotta take life as it comes, not how I want or expect it to go. Today I just do the best I can, and if the best doesn't come my way, who knows what the future holds, I gotta be present to see it unfold though ",2,t1_nd72ewl

I was scripted codeine at 17, which started an addiction until I was 36. I moved onto Dihydrocodeine and at the end was swallowing 60 x 30mg per dose, daily. My tolerance was at over a gram per dose, sometimes I'd throw more on top through the day. My liver ached and I was sedated up to my eyeballs, I don't really know just how out of it I really was at the end. The spiral goes deep even on these so called weak opioids. I lost it and confessed to a friend, who drove me to my local addiction services the next day. I started on buprenorphine and it was the beginning of finally changing my life and addressing my shit.  It's been a hard journey though, and though I'm 3yrs into recovery I'm still on the long acting bupe injection, working on coming off in the future. 

Don't end up like me. Reach out for help if you need it, and take the support that is offered. It doesn't have to be medication if you don't want that. My biggest change has come from behavioural changes and connecting with others through support groups. You can do this. Life is so much more without living in the fog of sedation.

Edit: Gabapentin actually helps to alleviate the majority of withdrawal symptoms. If you're able to use your Gabapentin script without abusing it (as it's also addictive and has its own set of withdrawals so must be careful to manage it), then you should be able to get through the worst of it without too much suffering, at least physically.",1,t3_1iw5bsa

4091,mcx21mb,1iq46sw,I can’t cope being sober,lopethrowaway,"I think pretty much everyone on this forum can relate to what you just wrote. Most of our addictions started at that age.

I think earliest on my justification was ""yeah, opiates are bad, but *I'm* going to find a way to make them work for me"". But it is literally, humanly, impossible. The part of your brain right now that wants to go back to either one last use, or some kind of occasional use, whatever, is, obviously, flawed. If you like opiates and you continue to take them they'll continue to control you. That's all there is to it.

Unfortunately there is no easy way to continue with sobriety other then trying to override what your limbic system *wants* you to do with some serious conscious effort. If you go back to some pattern of using opiates, you'll either sink into daily use again, and have a huge problem, or you'll ""only"" set your recovery back to square one in terms of the mental game.

I’m fortunate I don’t have the side effects some people do. OP I don’t want to suggest methadone at your age but if you are still dealing with this in 5 years please look into it. For now if I were you I’d go to an NA meeting. You don’t have to be religious to get something out of it. They have young people groups where you’d meet other people your age who will understand what you’re going through more than anyone else. Just don’t give up! You aren’t going to be happy every day. That’s just life. Get involved in things to stay busy. The more active you are the less you think about using. I promise you that you aren’t alone. You have to give sobriety a go completely to really experience the positives. I wish you the best and am sending you strength and peace ❤️,3,t1_mczhqkx

But at the end of the day, you have one simple choice of action - to use or not to use. Make your body refrain from drugs (go through the motions), and your brain will eventually follow.


Do not trust your brain in these early days. It's wired now to unconsciously put drugs above all else for your ""survival"". The only way to get rid of this pathway is abstinence and create a new ""rut"" for it to follow ie. a sober lifestyle. I highly recommend staying as busy as you can doing ""normal"" things, it makes the early days go quicker and reinforces a different pattern for your brain to follow. You probably don't feel like it at all, thinking the whole time how much better it would be if you were high, but staying super busy really helped me.

But I'm just doing what research shows had the best results and what feels right for me. My doctor said id have to go 5 days without until I'd feel any withdrawls which would mean I'd have to wait AT LEAST that long if I did want to get high. And since I've never had a 5 day long craving, I think this is the safest route for me at the moment. I personally don't care if I have to take suboxone for the rest of my life if it means I never do dope again. The suboxone also REALLY helps with cravings for me. I wish there was a medication like suboxone for meth and crack cravings. I've been clean from meth for 7 years and just two days ago had a VERY intense, vivid dream and in the dream my desire for meth was enormous and uncontrollable. It was crazy dream. I was with my son (he's 1) and I just had to get my hands on some meth. But even in the dream I was feeling guilt about trying to get it. I had the thoughts of like 'I can't do this! I'm going to feel so horrible after! But actually I'll be high so I won't. It doesn't matter. I have to have it right now'. It was EXACTLY like a craving but in a dream. Really weird. I've also been clean from crack for 2 years and my cravings for that are also EXTREMELY intense, although less frequent than before. It was a 24/7 battle in my head for a loooooooong time. But the suboxone is very effective at curbing my cravings for dope. I've been around it countless times this past year and never slipped not even once. 

I honestly NEVER thought I'd be able to say I haven't gotten high in a year! I couldn't even say a week for decades! I hope the same for you as well!",7,t1_mboqkws

And good childhood does not equal no addiction as an adult. So the issue doesn't really seem to trace back to childhood conditions alot of the time. It points towards genetic predisposition largely. That's not the rule though. Many circumstances can lead people to drug abuse. But I believe most people who end up way off the deep end were predisposed to do so anyways. It's just a matter of what triggered that dormant addictive tendency. This is just my thoughts not science. Science may disagree with me completely,1,t1_m201iqx

OC made it seem that addiction always stems from childhood trauma or abuse which is just not true. I've had a very privileged life with zero trauma.

Why are you trying to talk about something you don’t know anything about? I don’t get it.

Keep telling it to someone who knows even less than you do. 

Because you aren’t telling this 51 year old recovered addict with a degree In psychology.",1,t1_m2075mw
4187,nsf5oe1,1peup0i,I got a funny question for yall who’ve gone through withdrawal for at least a week or more. Esp women,wearythroway,Yeah i always found that i had a very distinctive stink when i had bad withdrawals. Itll get better. Our bodies/minds go through a lot trying to return to homeostasis when we stop using.,18,t3_1peup0i

Esp women,Fringelunaticman,"As a guy, we go from having very few erections to wet dreams and nonstop erections during withdrawal. And we cannot last more than a few seconds masturbating or having sex. Honestly, I probably masterbated 10 times one day during the acute stage because I kept getting erections and since it only took 5 seconds, why not. 

Maybe the same thing is happening to you as a woman? You know, the body is just trying to return to equilibrium and thats just one aspect of the body doing its job? Idk, though since I haven't personally experienced it",25,t3_1peup0i

Me (25)my dad (54) and my brother (26) all got off fent at the same time during the last hurricane here in Florida…. Def some uh smells permitting the area😂we called it the detox stank.

My period completely stopped when I was using daily, I didn't need deodorant,  and I barely sweated. When I quit, holy shit the smell...

You're doing great!",7,t3_1peup0i

Especially testosterone but it can impact estrogen too and they all balance each other. We stink as teenagers when they’re all fluctuating so it stands to reason this could be the cause.

It’s from sweating so much. Do you wear thongs? If so switch to granny panties, 100% cotton. Also use baby powder - the cornstarch one. Even if you don’t shower everyday wash the front and back area with baby shampoo and whatever soap you use. Then put on the baby powder. Check your butt crack- sometimes the sweat accumulates there and you end up with a bunch of bacteria that STINKS! (Why baby shampoo? IDK why but that’s my method and it WORKS!) good luck!",3,t3_1peup0i

Drink lots of water so you also don’t get dehydrated either. But it will eventually go away!

And wear cotton panties, no thongs. But at night when sleeping, don’t wear anything down there and let her air out. But during the day I’d def wear some panties so jeans or whatever other materials aren’t rubbing all in your whoo-ha lol.

And stay away from perfumes or scented stuff down there too. Boric acid is amazing though! I use a women’s wash for down there that has Boric acid in it and I love it.",2,t3_1peup0i

Esp women,cross_fader,"Opioids are great antitusives (dry things up- that's why they are in cough medicine). Your body always aims to maintain homeostasis, so if a *rug is taken chronically that drys things up, the opposite will happen during withdrawal- eyes watering, nose running, sweating, clammy, diarhoea.. The sweating can last months after cessation.


Lots of water, exercise, good foods, is about all you can do about it to be honest..",1,t3_1peup0i

But this is unrelated to that mostly. Cause anytime I masturbate I clean it up right away. And even if I don’t touch myself down there it’s still happening constantly. Even when I’m not turned on at all. It’s more like discharge that I used to get during puberty but 100x worse. That’s why I’m hoping another chick will chime in lol.",7,t1_nsf52cb

So when I sleep I usually like to wear pants or shorts at least, but I never wear any form of underwear. My mom taught me growing up you should not wear underwear to bed to “air her out” like you said. I’m in New England and it’s 20 degrees out and the fam is trying to save money on the heating bill. So it’s like too hard for me to go to bed completely nude down there, but I did just buy some new warmer sheets so it might be worth trying. I just also feel like being totally nude down there is just gonna make my sheets and blankets smell like it more too 🥴😭",1,t1_nsjsc7b

I was stable on a daily dose for a year and then all of the sudden about an hour or so after dosing I would get insanely nauseous and dizzy. I tried telling them about it and the people at the clinic just brushed me off. I ended up getting take homes and I would have a snack with it and take it before bed and then I’d be mostly fine. It also made me sweat to an embarrassing amount. I went to a job interview in August (it was like 75 degrees out) and the people had the heat on.. I literally was completely and obviously drenched in sweat. Like my hair looked like I had just dunked my head in the sink. I had to lie and tell them I had really bad nerves and it was my first interview in a long time. I actually had to interrupt the interviewer and walk out and go sit in their bathroom and take my shirt off and try to cool down. I was so embarrassed I told them I wasn’t feeling well and I had to cut the interview short and apologized. They actually offered me the job still which I found WILD. Like called me two weeks later and asked if I still wanted the position. I think I was just over qualified tbh and they probably spent that two weeks looking for someone less sweaty but didn’t find any as qualified maybe. 💀😂I didn’t take it for the sole reason of their building being way too hot and I knew i would sweat that much every single day there.,1,t1_nsk055x

I was constantly sweating on it. And I had absolutely no problems “getting wet” either the whole time I was on it. I’m actually sweating less now during withdrawal than when I was taking it daily.

(I was on gabs short term for the RLS. Seroquel for sleep, and Wellbutrin for the depression) I was able to just walk off of all of those with zero side effects after a couple of months. If your totally against that (which I get) try some over the counter magnesium. I would also highly recommend buying ""ON Amino Energy"" it's available OTC at CVS. It's just a powder you mix in water. Amino acids are Uber important for speed running through PAWS. After a month I can't stress getting some sort of regular exercise in as well.

The first 45 days are tough and your gonna be questioning every life decision you've ever made and whether or not your strong enough to carry on.

I’ll share my story, but I’ll make it quick
(Side note i’ve been day trading for a long time) 

 • In 2021, i slowly weaned myself by using simple math. Slowly extending the time between each use & eventually lowering the amount simultaneously. It was painless, it took 24/7 dedication and being 100% DONE with it, i no longer had the desire. I wanted my life back. 

After implementing this for 3-4 weeks i woke up one morning & went to the bathroom and for the first time in years I WAS FREE ! 

I go back to my room and do some research on the stock market. (This was before AMC & GameStop ran from $1 to $500.) 

i bought $140 of AMC and held it , long story short i made $9,800 over 2-3 weeks.

Like others have said it’s all a mental game now, there’s going to be rough days but there will also be good days so hold onto any positive energy you can get. Your brain is already healing! It may take another couple years but you fucking got this I promise you! You’ve already made it through the worst of withdrawals and it’s only going to go up from here! You’re absolutely amazing. This internet stranger is so goddamn proud of you! Keep focusing on the little things like the sunsets, the breeze, the moon, treat yourself with your favorite hot or cold (nonalcoholic ofc) beverages, foods or desserts, and any time you get a craving remind yourself YOU do not have to bring that craving to life by turning it into a relapse and disrupting your reality if you don’t want to. When I first got clean, I would always go take a shower when I was having cravings and I’d imagine the water was washing any bad vibes and shitty thoughts away. Or you could go on walks (sounds like you’re doing this and exercising, keep it up! I regret not doing more of this when I first got sober) or whatever else to take your mind off the craving, depressing thought, whatever till it passes. 

Because only you have the power to go back to the drugs now and you absolutely never have to let it happen. If you’re having a bad time just remind yourself you’re so much stronger than you’re even aware and you’ve already survived so much, so you can get through anything! A craving? HA that’s nothing compared to everything else you’ve endured in your lifetime. Even if you don’t believe it at first, make sure you tell yourself you’re confident in your ability to stay sober until one day you actually do mean it.

You should be really proud of yourself and I’m so glad to hear you’re at 9 days now. Before you know it that’ll be a month, 6 months, a year, two years and you’ll look back and be like wow I’m so glad I stuck to this. Slowly everything in life WILL come together the way it’s supposed to but that can only happen if you stay sober. 

If I had relapsed I wouldn’t have been able to go back to school, I wouldn’t have been able to be with my kid (today was her last day of kindergarten 😭 I got clean while I was pregnant and never looked back) I wouldn’t have been able to marry the love of my life, I wouldn’t have a good job and a future with my career, I wouldn’t have a strong support system like I do now and I’d probably still be a mess mentally. I wouldn’t have money for things I want to get or do, I’d still be in the negative I’m sure. I can actually travel once in a while now too. Lots of things that would’ve never been possible before if I kept sniffing dope. 

There are still things I hope will happen soon, like I lost my license when I was 19 and using and still haven’t gotten it back so that really sucks but I’m just hoping soon I’ll be able to afford to do that. I know it’ll happen but getting pretty tired of it taking so long. Oh well, aside from that for the most part life is way better than I ever imagined it would be back when I was still using dope or cocaine constantly. I truly just wanted to end it all and never expected to survive this long so actually having to do so was a mindfuck at first, but I now try to take every day as a gift. A gift from the past me who did ultimately decide enough was enough and it was time to get clean, a gift from her to the me today who has a lot to thank that girl for. 

Anyway just take it day by day, I swear it does get easier. I once in a while have a drug dream but I don’t get cravings anymore even when something horrible happens, when my first thought would’ve been “time to get high” in the past. I think the cravings stopped around 2ish years which makes sense since that’s about the time it takes for your mind to recover from the drugs off-balancing everything. And even if I wanted to relapse I’d be too afraid with all the evil shit they cut everything with these days so I’m fairly confident it’ll never happen. Ofc you can never say never as an addict but you can become so strong willed about recovery that you’re pretty damn sure using is now a thing of the past. You’ll get there soon! Don’t give up on yourself. I believe in you OP, you’re a badass for getting through the first 9 days. Here’s to many many years more ❤️ please never stop believing in yourself!

My guess would be that after nine days the worst of it is behind you. The rest is slow and steady wins the race. Stay off that shit unless you need it.

The Lyrica WAS a lifesaver for me. The clonodine was amazing for when my heart was racing but after about ten days, I didn’t need it as much anymore. But I still would relapse after a couple of weeks. I used for five years and I’ll be real: I failed a drug test on probation and spent 4.5 months in jail. Withdrawal sucked in there but when I was done, I was so clear-headed. We were allowed an hour every two weeks of outdoor time and two hours a week of church or classes so I know ppl say exercise is key but I didn’t get any of that. Also no fresh fruit or veggies, no vitamin C, just warm water and lots of peanut butter sandwiches. Journaling helped, talking to others also getting clean helped. But being off it was enough, a big enough success. I was so dead-set: I’d never go back on that shit. 

So here’s my advice. 

When I got out, the biggest issue for me was getting back into my normal life and realizing I had to face real life problems without the safety net I used to have for the Bad Feelings lol. Like any time I stressed about money or my relationship as a user, I just used and things seemed manageable. Sober, it wasn’t like that. Even after all those months, I wanted to use. So I moved 1,000 miles away and got on subs bc I didn’t trust myself. I am not thrilled to be on subs but life is a far cry from the way it was before and I feel more in control this way. You are going to struggle when you are no longer in a controlled environment and you have access to oxy again. Your situation will be exactly the same except for your mindset so your mindset has to be stronger than your surroundings. If you start to falter, MAT is ok. Moving away until you feel stronger is ok. I wish I’d done some therapy to figure out better coping skills, something besides numbing myself, so that I hadn’t gone on subs at all. But I didn’t have the money or the discipline, I felt, to stay off shit using simply the struggle-bus brain that put me in that situation to start. Just start planning now for what you’re gonna do when you feel the need to use out there. Support systems, NA, MAT, etc. Plan now so you’re not lost when you start to falter bc you will, at some low points, think about it. 

You can totally do this! You’ve come this far and I have no doubt you’ll make it the rest of the way. You’re full of gratitude and drive just by reading your comments. You will be just fine :)",2,t3_1la8dvw

But give yourself some grace. Listen to your body, sleep if you need it, eat healthy, and I swear exercising helps. Even if it’s just walking to the mailbox and back.

I relapsed with kratom for a few months, only taking it once a day for a while, then onion heroin for about 1-2 weeks. 

I was extremely resistant to getting back on any maintenance but I realised that is where I’m at in my recovery and am now stable on an extremely low dose of bupe; like 1 mg or less per day. It’s not perfect but it’s better than where I was heading.

4379,muzbmf0,1kwx0lz,3 months clean from methadone and relapsed hard,Mrcrunch08,"Please don't give up hope. Any form of treatment is better and safer than gambling on the streets, especially when the possibility of a careless supplier could mean life and death. Personally, methadone never worked for me due to my weakness, location, and learning what the combination was like. Subs helped change my life. Even switching to straight bup allowed me to sustain myself for years and make progress without slipping. Saying that, I eventually lost my insurance, and my new insurance wasn't accepted by any local doctors who offered the script. I had to get resourceful and get myself down from an 8 in the morning and an 8 at night to just 1mg in the morning and 1mg at night. I maintained that small dose for another 6 months to then cut that in half for a month before eventually running out. Despite such a low dose, the withdrawal may have been the worst I have ever experienced. It wasn't as intense as precipitated withdrawal, but it was bad from day 3 to day 10 without improvement. Over a month later, I still wanted to break every limb at the joint to alleviate the restlessness and pain. I ended up getting desperate and breaking out the old loperamide and grapefruit juice from back in the day. Oddly, after doing that, things rapidly improved without regressing back into how I felt previously. 

I say all of that just to emphasize that doctors don't really know how these meds make us feel and what it's like getting off. I have always found people like those here and from other forums where everyone is named swim if I remember to be a better source of knowledge, and if they support the shot, it may be worth looking into. If you feel you don't have the strength and still need ritual, sub/bup is a great choice. Just make sure you have an exit plan for when you are ready, and don't just trust your doctor. The longer you're on, the harder it is to get off. That could be where the shot comes in unless you have the mental part beat. Good luck and stay positive.",2,t3_1kwx0lz

Maybe you weren't ready or dont have enough supports in your life to come off.  But if you're not looking to get back on maintenance dose why not just take low dose for a week titrated. 30mg is enough to hold off w/d symptoms and just slowly titrate down for the week. There's no shame in having to take medication though. Maybe bupe would be a better fit. Good luck ,1,t3_1kwx0lz

Withdrawal wise and ptsd wise it  changed my life so much. I tried everything to get off of Subutex before. I tried sublocade, Brixadi, lucemyra, clonidine, tricking my system with other meds. Ibogaine was the only thing that worked for me. My body is weird so none of the sublocade/brixadi shots just would absorb in my system for some reason. It’s crazy because most people can’t get it out of their system after they take their last shot, but I didn’t test positive for bupe even with shots. I talked to both manufacturers. My doctor talked to other doctors and we never could figure it out. I was desperate, so I did ibogaine. Super grateful for the experience.

What you’ve done with your life, and where you’re at right now is one of the best moments you’ll have associated with the success of sobriety.

Getting clean off fentanyl is something people don’t do - less than 2% of people do it - so remind yourself everyday, that makes you just as successful, just as strong, just as rare and special and unique as the 1% of America! Those upper echelons of society that beat the odds and make billions and control our world. All that power and success, drive and otherworldly influence. You, are just as rare as them, only in a better and stronger way. You are one of a kind and your children are so lucky and blessed to have that kind of love and commitment in their lives.

Far be it from me to discourage somebody who wants to stop using to abandon their quest. But yeah I was kind of worried about whether he would need that prescription later. I assume he has it under control and knows what is best for him though. 

Peer pressure can be weird- Once I was on an online NA meeting and everybody encouraged this person to throw their drugs into the toilet and it turned out it was a prescribed medication for a pain condition and i really thought it irresponsible of the group to loudly encourage this person to throw their drugs away when they did not even know that it was medicine or what the medicine was for or any of the other details.",6,t1_mame1or
4433,man1rb1,1ig409c,Day 4 coming off Oxy and Heroin,VajraHound,"Yep, I’ve had that in my head for YEARS. Believe me. I’ve been prescribed Oxys for 29 years. I’m only prescribed 200mg
per day atm, but back in the 2000’s I was on MASSIVE doses. They were giving them out like candy. Now, they only prescribe
Oxys for terminal illness. 

Here’s the killer - if I give them up, I will never be prescribed them again (unless I get a terminal illness of course). So I’ll be
giving them up for good. But I also know many many Heroin dealers. So it scares me that, if I’m in times of great pain, that I’ll 
just go and score some Smack. And the Gear here is excellent, and quite cheap (£150 for a quarter ounce - edit - that’s about 
$120 for a quarter ounce of prime afghan#3).

I controlled my Oxy use really well for years. But 2 years ago I had massive trauma - I was stabbed by a lunatic, and shortly
after that I was the only witness to a death by dangerous driving. I gave the man CPR, but I couldn’t save him. Following these
events my Oxy use went out of control, and I started filling in the gaps with Heroin. The problem was, the Heroin is much stronger
than my Oxys, so the Oxys were consumed even quicker.

So this has led to me wanting to live totally clean. No opiates, no nothing. I don’t drink alcohol (I can’t because stomach cancer
has left me a mess). So, after 29 years, I’m giving it all up. I’m pretty sure it wasn’t doing much for my pain either. I’d just become
a serious drug addict. My consumption has been enormous. So fuck it all off. I wanna live.",2,t1_mame1or

4439,man3n5a,1ig409c,Day 4 coming off Oxy and Heroin,VajraHound,"Thanks for the reply my friend. Yes, I have thought about asking my (adult) daughters to pick them up for me, or my
ex-wife, who is my closest confidante. But I live out in the sticks (Peak District, UK) and they’re all in Manchester. It’s
only about 30 miles, and I guess I could ask my GP to send my meds to a pharmacy in Manchester?

Yeah, I’m only on Day 4 (nearly Day 5) so these thoughts are constantly racing through my head. Thoughts of removing
the turquoise film from an Oxy 80, crushing it up and snorting it to send me to heaven. But that just leaves me with other
thoughts of breaking up a huge rock of Heroin onto some foil and having a toot to paradise. It’s fucking hard, man.

I just wanna break this addiction and start afresh. But yeah, if I give up my script. Never again😕",1,t1_mamzbep
4440,maumgtr,1ig409c,Day 4 coming off Oxy and Heroin,l45k,"You're doing great by the sounds of things as in passion to be free of the chains. Having an oxy dependence is a full time Lease. It's not a job because a job pays you:) a Leaae or mortgage strangles life from you and it's payment is always due without exception! If you don't have the pills there is penalty interest....it will audit you and make you suffer until it's debt is paid. Sometimes you even try to pay off some principle thinking that will suffice for the day, only.to be redosing again and again more and more. I'm actually amazed at high doses you were cognitively undeterred for your role. I remember doing a minor in Philosophy and some of the critical thinking and logical if then not else....was taxing on the opiate brain letalone the very dense reading of Loche or Hobbs. I bet you must enjoy watching the Good Place ;) albeit Chiddi prob doesn't represent you haha.  I always hated hearing just quit for your kids but in my addiction mind it convenes that you can't be a father let alone function without oxy so you have to keep paying the Lease and not be bed ridden or miserable. 
The thing that got me through last time was alot of wim hof breath work, ice or cold plunges and weight training. Yoga and stretching was also great but I needed the rush and endorphins as fast as possible. 
One thing that I find really difficult to overcome is going out or doing literally anything without having my security on me..knowing that pill is in my pocket and there's another one after that... the sad reality of only being content or safe when I had a new script with full boxes.

Anyway wishing you the best and hope you keep finding the strength to happy life without a oxy Lease (leash)!",2,t1_maptloo

So yeah, one minute, one hour, one day at a time. I’ve been listening to ‘Trane a lot today and literally sobbing
my eyes out at the beauty of the music. I’m stroking my dog and it’s like feeling his fur for the first time. It’s

This person was brand new to the meeting and it sounded like also to NA generally. I recall that everybody got fired up with the spirit after one kind of experienced/well respected person possibly the speaker (?) or the person who invited the speaker idk anyway they scolded the group and said we were not doing enough to help this new person and suddenly everyone started encouraging her to throw her stuff away - which to be fair I think she had expressed that she wanted to do? Honestly I don't remember. She just later in this ordeal of throwing them away and sharing etc like mentioned that they were opiate pills prescribed and it wasn't the abundant-prescriptions era so it occurred to me that this person maybe really needed those meds or whatever and here we bunch of idiots just yelled at her until she flushed them away? What if she now gets sick when she could possibly have tapered? I dunno. Eventually that meeting disbanded I think because there was difficulty finding enough people to pitch in and help host and so on or maybe some other reason related or not to dynamics like such that were displayed in the incident I just described (thinking about it now maybe would not be shocking - idk I did really enjoy the meeting generally especially at first when I was really trying to give NA a go). 

Definitely glad you clarified that this is not normal or part of the program in fact at most meetings in my experience ""cross talking"" or addressing other people directly in the group isn't done... normally that didn't happen at this meeting either it just happened suddenly that day.

Thank You again - testicular - two seminomas (lost both) so yeah, I could be described as a Eunuch, Lol ( You gotta see the funny side) also Stomach Cancer (Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumour - that was the real MF), followed by a rather annoying tongue cancer (squamous-cell carcinoma).

But considering I've been through so much, I'm actually doing well - I run half-marathons,  I'm at the Gym most days too. I may have lost my bollocks, my stomach, and just a third of my tongue, I've still got my looks (vain bastard, Lol 😂) and I can still speak very well normally, and sexually  TRT covers erections (sorry to be so crass).

But. I'm very concerned that without the Oxy and Heroin my running performance and gym days will be much more difficult. I can't argue when I ran, or met my mates at the Gym and I'd just snorted 3x80 Oxy's ---- I was on FIRE on track and on the weights🔥

But anyways, thank You so much - I can't tell You how much I appreciate people's support here. I've been here a long time, and it's full of great people with sound advice.

So I'm nearly at the end of Day 5, and it is getting slightly better each day (slightly😬). The main thing I gotta do is take my beautiful dog out twice a day, and although that's been a real challenge just to put one foot in front of the other, I've not let my boy down once.

I'm a family man, and they come first. They've been very worried about the Heroin thing - I tell my kids everything - and the last thing I wanna do is worry my children.

I'm also a runner and it's also my dream to compete in a Triathlon. I can't actually swim Lol (I fell into a well when I was 3, and my Dad rescued me, which also risked his life - but he got us both out. I've never been submerged fully in water since) but I've booked up for adult lessons starting next week. My goal is, within a year, I will be competing in a local Triathlon. Without Opiates.

Bupe is very very hard to OD on especially if you already have a high tolerance for opiates (which I did at the time), so she said it was relatively safe. 
Took my first 8mg sub at the 24 hour clean mark, went into precips in a matter of like 15-20 mins, then took an additional 8mg sub every 30 mins or so until I got out of it. Probably ended up taking 5-6 8mg subs total over a couple hours but it fuckin worked— pulled me out of precips within a couple hours and helped me start induction on subs without needing to wait several days, micro dose, all that shit. Bernes method never worked for me but macrodosing subs to get out of precips 100% did. 
I still felt pretty shitty because my body had just been put thru the ringer for like 6 hours, but I slept it off and was able to continue subs the next day at the normal dose (8mg) and felt much better by day 2-3. No major withdrawal symptoms, just overall feeling ehhh as my body adjusted to being on suboxone and not fent, and recovering after being on such a long bender and terrible health overall lol. 

I would recommend this every time for anyone, it’s helped several people get OUT of precips. I don’t know why more detoxes don’t allow you to macro dose subs. The way my doctor explained it to me was that you have to “fill your opiate receptors with so much bupe it knocks the fent analogs off your recepetors”. Precips happen when the bupe & fent are fighting themselves to stay stuck on your receptors, essentially. 

Note you’ll need at least, I would say, 8-10 sub strips minimum just to be safe AND you’ll probably need enough to continue taking subs during your vacation… I don’t know how you’d feel if you macrodosed subs and then stopped taking any subs. Withdrawal symptoms would probably return, I’d think? Also any comfort meds you can get your hands on for the days following— gabapentin, muscle relaxants, etc. 

Good luck man 🤞🏼 I know this shit is a beast. If you can get thru vacation & start on subs, get yourself on Sublocade asap when you’re back home — only thing that helped me get to 2 years clean & 10000% better than Suboxone in maintaining recovery imo.",4,t3_1ojiz8a

I will say though man, it is wayyyy more worth just waiting it out then doing that. Precip is rough. Especially as you get older. I have been dependent on opioids for around 14 years. I am on suboxone steady now and have been for 3 years at this point.  
Precip the last couple times I did it to myself, would make me act like I was possessed by a fucking demon or something. I would made vocal outbursts or absolutely random shit. It was something I could not  control whatsoever. Screaming at the top of my lungs (a way to make your neighbors think you are absolutely fucking insane to the say the least) I have my own home at least, so not in an apartment.  
It is very much well worth waiting out the 24-72h you may need to  wait to score high enough on COWS scale. The relief you receive from doing that is exponentially better than putting yourself through a hellish time waiting for that suboxone to actually work. No matter if I would put myself through precip, it would take at least a full 24h-36hr for that suboxone to work.

I did carry subs with me. I used right before getting on an about 12hr. Flight. I got there and was completely fine till about 6am approx 20-24 hours later I was by the resort pool and almost threw up in some bushes but I made it to my room and instantly started throwing up. I layed in that room going through the wd motions for couple days then took small pieces of sub but they were brittle and old and had little effect. So I started researching western countries nearby where I could go cop something because I'm the type of addict that I'll fly across the world to quit only to fly somewhere else to use. Anyway I really wanted to attend my brother's wedding so I waited 5 days and on the morning of the wedding I just flew home, missing the wedding. I used immediately as I got home. I basically wasted like 6k and if I had a longer layover in Paris, I would have definitely left the airport and went and found something there. Looking back, I wish I would've just taken fent with me as I would've enjoyed the country and wedding. If you can find someone with some methadone take homes and buy them, that'd be your best bet. Idk what you use but I had enough fent in my system to go close to, if not, 24hrs without starting wd. You shouldn't have to worry about the plane ride unless you have long layovers and/or multiple connections. Given what I went through, I'd not ruin a vacation instead take care of yourself first. I recently just quit cold turkey as the last two times I shot up it felt like the world was falling on my head so that feeling gave me enough motivation to quit. I did have adavan the first few days and little methadone on day 8 and 9 and day 15 and 16 and day 20. I'm still extremely tired and sleep schedule is crazy off and I'm at day 21 rn. I did take kratom here and there but I don't think it did anything. I quit abruptly but if I could go back I'd have planned a little bit. Also been through pwd before.  I'd never go through that again. Hope my experiences help some.",2,t3_1ojiz8a

I’m on high doses of oxy daily for pain and sometimes I choose to come off them. I set myself up for withdrawal, comfort meds, a long back/leg pillow, magnesium spray for my restless legs, zofran for nausea, clonodine, and klonopin for anxiety and anything that will knock me out to sleep (usually trazadone) and it takes me about 3 days in bed to get over that weak awful sick feeling of WD. And I have been using opiates since 2014 medically. 3 days of withdrawal. Unless you are a recreational user and your method of consumption is different? Unsure but no judgement here my brother is a recovering IV fetanyl user. I’d never judge anyone. Feel free to inbox me. I def don’t recommend precipitated withdrawal it scares me even to read someone wants to do that but I get it. Also if you must do this I really suggest when you get to the airport to go to the counter and see if they can switch some seating around and get you an aisle close to a bathroom.

However, if there are NO OTHER options, be prepared. You really need someone to watch over you for a couple of days. Precipitated withdrawals are where it can get dangerous. Make sure to stay hydrated and eat regularly, even if it's just a little. Magnesium, vitamin C, and Milk Thistle may help a bit.

I was on 180mg daily of clean oxy and just desperate to get off. My parents were coming to visit and in my mind I just didn’t want to be on drugs anymore.  I was on monthly vivitrol injection for the last several months before lapsing and using for a month straight. At the end of the month of using and when I was scheduled for my vivitrol injection, I said fuck it, got clean urine, and went to the clinic for the shot (they would never give you the viv injection while hot).  So after I tested negative w the clean urine, I got the shot which took maybe 30 min before my bowels liquified and I was profusely sweating. I was driving home and had to stop and pay at a gas station to use their private  toilet because I would not have made it home.  



Once I got home, I was vomiting and shitting myself for 4 days straight - couldn’t sleep couldn’t eat, felt like I was going to die or at least wanted to kill myself.  After 4 days and the oxy finally out of my system, I stopped throwing up from both ends and started to feel somewhat normal.  This was the worst wd I’ve ever experienced and I’ve been through it plenty of times.  Putting yourself thru PWD is just dangerous and I do not recommend.  Side note - I got clean from something called Ibogaine which is a miracle plant that has worked wonders for me that vivitrol and any maintenance meds never could.  First time in 12 years I literally have not type of MAT in me or oxy etc.  and I feel no cravings or wd since my Ibogaine treatment. Good luck!!

Side note - I’ve also done the rapid detox under anesthesia - thankfully I’ve somehow had money during all my years of opiate / pill addiction.  But they told me I was vomiting the whole time while under thank god I didn’t aspirate.  And it was a waste of over 20k cuz I still relapsed.

Waited a full 24 hours, absolutely agonising. Tried to blunt the pain with 1000mg of lyrica. That shit just made it way worse. Like your drunk. 

Hit the max score on Cows. 

Started taking 2mg of bupe on the 24th hour. And shit got crazy insane. 

Went into precipitated withdrawal. Normally I sweat like like I'm in oven but this time I was vomiting, shitting whilst every bone in my body felt like liquid nitrogen had been injected into them. 

Over the next 6 hours I took more and more bupe. Shit I shot up the subutex. Blew past 32mg.

I was having convulsions, couldn't stop moving. Hallucinations, hearing shit. Crawled to the shower and found the only relief was under the shower. Spent the next 7 hours in the shower, passed out. Flooded the house. 

Woke up to water everywhere. Still sick. Huddled on the couch and finally at 5am the bupe kicked in. 

Felt like I had the living shit beaten out of me. I've had cluster headaches, cerebral haemorrhages, kidney stones, multiple broken limbs, lots of burns and knife wounds, and more inner ear infections then I can count. 

That night coming off the gear was hands down the worst pain of my entire life, combined. 

Fuck Buprenorphine, that shit never felt right and is impossible to come off unless you get the subcutaneous shot, though for many the rate of release into blood is anything but steady. 

Methadone is far far superior and a lot easier to taper off. With a sub 1ml syringette you can easily taper down smaller amounts every 2-4 weeks without any negative experience. 

Slow, really fucking slow, and steady wins the race.

Opiates are a cruel mistress. 

The worst thing is that their technically not even withdrawals. It's the build up of two chemicals, Morphine-3-glucuronide which your body misinterprets as the molecular junk of a virus. 

In turn it your body makes these things called Proinflammatory cytokines. These cytokines are used to fight infections, which they cause diarrhoea, cramps, fever, aches and paon (as they attack vulnerable tissue) (think back when you had a bad flu, it's the same chemicals that cause that), which you normally don't feel coz all the good opiate shit is blocking the pain. 

Until you run out of the good opiates, morphine-6-glucuronide.

There are online retailers and even rehabs that now provide a drug to block the production of cytokines, called ibudilast. One of the safest drugs ever discovered. 

With a bit of ibudilast dosed for a month before you jump off it'll remove a good 80-90% of the pain we call opiates withdrawal.",6,t1_nmaqyeh

What was her dose? The phase III B trial that MediciNova did for opiate addiction had very miminal side effects with a 80% reduction in symptoms.

Plus what the material said about its use in Japan to treat bronchitis.

>have yet to see any rehabs use it when I was working in drug counseling/rehabilitation therapy

I was talking to a rehab senior consultant about ibudilast, she said that high end clinics in the US were giving it to patients. I was pushing her for it but at that point the TGA (Australian FDA) wouldn't consider it.

Anyway i got off the gear so it ceased to be a boulder I was willing to push (there was a route for off label importation but the paper work was immense).

Black market ibudilast didn't seem to be a prudent avenue either as it meant going back into the dark net (like a baby in a candy store)......

It was actually during the phase 2 MS ibudilast clinical trial I believe it was if I recall correctly, they don't actually prescribe it here in America but she was part of the clinical trial. And it did help her, it slowed down her brain atrophy. But for her the side effects became too much. But I do know that a lot of ppl in the trials didn't get those side effects, so if it truly can help, hopefully the FDA will approve it here. That's how I found out about it, I did a bunch of research when she was on it and seen that they were also doing trials for opiate withdrawals. I remember my mom saying that the medical team that was helping her said that so far they were seeing some pretty positive outcomes from ibudilast.

I was in your shoes after getting clean. What I did was hit up every recovery meeting in my area (across several fellowships not just NA). Some were duds, but at others people took me under their wing. I asked for phone lists and reached out to people.

I now hang out with wonderful people every day. I wake up to my phone blowing up with texts wishing me a wonderful day and reminding me how loved I am.

I also had issues stemming from my childhood. They didn't go away when I stopped using. In fact, they seemed far more overwhelming without having drugs and alcohol to numb them away. I got into therapy and peer support groups to work on them. I've made a few breakthroughs since, and am keeping at it.

My brain chemicals were a little off balance and I was having depression, anxiety, and sleep issues. I worked with a psychiatrist to have them addressed.

If people aren't welcoming and friendly than fuck that meeting and try a new one.

For the first time I was receptive to what they were talking about and could see how it related to all my bullshit. I'm a real logical thinker, it has to make sense and there has to be proof of why it works for me to even consider excepting something, an IOP program in conjunction with meetings just kind of made the shit click one day.

I'd pretty much made peace with the fact that's just who I was going to be until the day I died.

I say all that shit to say 1) be proud of how far you have come, and don't forget where you came from 2) find your ppl, it makes a world of difference 3) really consider applying the 12 steps to your recovery (even if you don't go to the meetings) bc it's some pretty solid advice for anyone to go by not just addicts.

I know exactly what you mean.. it’s like it feels like it’s been a lifetime since you were in what felt like the cycle you’ll never get out of & at the same time it’s like it was just yesterday that you were living it & dug yourself out. 

Don’t be too hard on yourself on the amount of time spent on heroin - at the very least, the struggle & the bad days helped build character and in the words of Jelly Roll;
 “I hate the man I used to be.. 
But he’ll always be a part of me. 
Right now, lookin’ at my past, I know it’s unpretty.. 
Can’t hide the pain that I’ve been through, 
I wear my scars like my tattoos.. 
The man who I was, was wrong … 
But he’s the one who built me”
🫶🏽

It’s normal to be afraid of relapsing, esp when youve put in sooo much work to rebuild your life and yourself! …Just remember not to put too much pressure on yourself by saying things like “I’ll never touch drugs again.” That’s where I’ve always messed up. I used to say that but I learned that I don’t feel the weight of it on my shoulders as much when I say i will spend every bad day trying to strengthen my coping skills so that I don’t turn to drugs again. It took me a while to learn to cope with bad days and the urges and cravings I’d get when having a bad day because when it’s good it’s great and I have no worries .. but every single day isn’t going to always be good. Remember to try to give yourself grace. You spent 12 years in the cycle of hell on earth.. you didn’t get where you were over night, so everything won’t be fixed overnight either. 

Keep fighting the good fight.

Anybody that emerge his from addiction is an incredibly strong person, even though it sounds like you have done things you’re not proud of, going through that battle and emerging victorious reveals a strength of character that you should be extremely proud of.  

I’m not totally clean right now, I cycle between taking Oxy, subs, and then I try to stay clean for as long as possible.  I can relate to what you said very, very clearly, when I am sober I just feels like life is paused, it’s like I’m just going through the motions until I can get high next.  It’s like I’m not really able to be myself until I have some oxy.  It’s not just a monkey on my back, it’s a 800 pound gorilla.

Spanish PM announced it on March 13, and on March 14, I called my parents to ask if they would let me stay with them during the lockdown. They agreed, and I took my last dose right after hanging up that call. The lockdown lasted until May. During that time, I barely slept, and it was really tough, but when going outside was allowed again, I had already been clean for two months. I had wasted other opportunities before, but this time I didn’t screw it up. I stayed clean and started seeing a psychologist, paid for by my parents.

It was hard, but I needed to do it. In 2019, I had two epileptic seizures, and I was so shattered that I could only think about ending my life.

Then I started taking small steps. I moved to another city, found a good job, and little by little, time passed until today—five years clean.

I understand your situation. To quit using drugs, you also have to change the rest of your life. You can’t quit an addiction if everything else stays the same because everything—your house, your job, your routines—will remind you of the times when you were high, and you’ll miss it. Changing cities and habits helped me a lot.

The things we addicts do when we’re trapped by drugs are incredible.

I hope you get lucky and are ready to clean yourself up soon. It also seemed impossible to me, but it's possible to defeat this demon, believe me. One day, you wake up and think, “I’m sick of this shitty life,” and that’s when you’re ready to do it.

I never understood it either. Yeah I used, but I see all these people who stole their families stuff and money get welcomed back with open arms. Mine kicked me out when they first found out I had a problem. 

Its all forgiven with my father now...bc he got addicted to oxy at the big age of 70 and I detoxed him with my methadone so the rest of the family wouldnt find out. 

At the end I had my wife, gf at the time, but she was just about done with me too. She paid my first month at the methadone clinic. I found out later that was her car payment and she didnt have papers at the time. An illegal immigrant gave me their car payment for my methadone and I was out on pre trial release bc I got RORed.

as with common problems, addicts in recovery have developed straightforward solutions. fellowships of addicts will love you until you learn to love yourself again. they'll give you a social network of people who will listen to your thoughts and help you process your emotions. they'll keep you company so you never have to be lonely again.",6,t3_1oej495

Also if you were anything like the type of addict I was, I probably wouldn’t give a fuck about you (me) either. And it’s not necessarily that you’re not loved, we as addicts are extremely selfish and don’t realize the agony and suffering families/friends go through just by watching us deteriorate. 

Again if you’re anything like me, when I burned bridges, they were almost always never getting rebuilt. People can only take so much. If it wasn’t for my father being in recovery, my family wouldn’t understand. An he was an alcoholic, opiate addiction is just impossible to  understand unless you’ve experienced it yourself. I mean I was injecting 80mg OCs when I was 16 and on the streets by that point.

Id also cling to any girl who was interested in me. Anything to keep me from being alone with myself. 


To me, even though I would have done anything to be clean, once id get there id disregard myself almost automatically. ""I dont have anyone so who am I really?"" It's taken me a long time to see that the value of my life isn't dependent on who's there and who isn't. Its a life, its My life. 


When I see strangers in the street looking disheveled or a person well groomed getting into a new Cadillac, I dont base the importance of their life on what it looks like their lives are equally as valuable. Who knows how their lives started and who knows how they will end, or what they've offered to the world, or what they didnt. They could be looking at me thinking the same, but ultimately its up to me to value my life. No one can do that except for me.


Ive seen plenty of addicts and alcoholics that had dozens of people, loved one, etc behind them, and even more who had no one and ultimately ive seen more people die from addiction with tons of supporters than ones who had no one, but it can happen either way, because again, its up to us to value our own lives, and face ourselves and the hard truths of why we even ended up not valuing them enough to make the decisions we did


I definitely can relate to not letting people in, mainly out of shame, but even more so because of how I grew up, which also involved alot of shame. Im learning to find a balance between being an open book for the whole world to read, and being entirely closed off. It seems to get easier to feel out as my body and mind repair, but its taken alot of deep cleaning and research of my own memories to help repair in a healthy way so that I can be assured I can cope in healthy ways for the rest of my life",2,t3_1oej495

Its a bit different but I also had almost no one the last years, I lost touch/fell out with everyone but my parents who I lived with, and we didn’t talk much. Getting sober I felt so awful about how so many other addicts still had people who cared about them, partners and friends and relationships they’d actually maintained. I felt like there must be something wrong with me if so many other addicts had that. I’m grateful my family did care and I could repair our relationship somewhat, but it took me a while to learn how to talk to anyone and be a human again and I still feel heavy about how behind I am and not having anyone in addiction, I still get jealous of what other addicts have. I used to think about how if I died, I don’t think anyone outside of family would’ve known let alone cared. It is lonely and sucks to feel even more isolated when addiction is already isolating, and making friends again is amazing but it still feels hard to not feel othered and ashamed by those years alone.

In the end everyone is different and half of it is luck, the grass usually isn’t greener. There’s a long list of things I’ve had it easier with, including stuff directly related to that isolation that’s made recovery easier in some ways",2,t3_1oej495

If you need someone to chat with at 3am, someone will respond. The people are mainly from the US however we have members that are from the UK, Australia, Mexico etc. It’s a great resource. We only uplift eachother and talk about what worked for us or helped along the way. I love the group and have made many friends through the chat. Many people have told me that the group chat is different than other groups they tried before. It really does help and you get many different people’s perspectives and experiences to learn from. We focus on preparation first, then the actual detox, last and most important is aftercare. The group is not the answer, it just really helps to know that you can be open, honest and lean on others. Sometimes we just need someone to talk with about our problems and there is no judgement in our group because it’s people that have been through addiction and some people in the group are still struggling with recovery. We have system that works and we want that for others. I created the group in 2021 and started with just 5 people and generally have just added people one at a time so it’s a grassroots community. Many of us have become close friends and it’s my favorite place to hang out. It is a private group however I know that addicts and recovering addicts are getting great benefits from it. It is my passion. If this is something that interests you, send me a message or DM. I love to grow the community for individuals that are really seeking help. I have only had to remove 3 people over the years because they were too negative and toxic for the group. I was on Subutex for over a decade so I get it. I know what it’s like to not feel normal and feel lonely. I don’t claim to have all the answers however there is a lot of knowledge in the group, community or tribe (whatever you want to call it). Don’t hesitate to message me. I come from a place of understanding and passion to help.

I imagine there are going to be a number of hands raised for this because there is solid correlation between “age of entry” and achieving long-term recovery (usually defined as either >3 years or >5 years). The statistical distribution is a version of a bell curve, and your age (34-36) is the peak. Now there are *a lot* of elements to this and the data can be sketchy because of that. But in general (without regard to specific substance, gender, term or addiction, etc.), recidivism rates are higher for people under 30 (with high “early relapse” risk that tracks as you go younger) and, people over 40-45.

Anecdotally, this matches what I see. I can explain more about why this is if you’d like. But to your direct question, there is most definitely hope. I was in active addiction for 14 years (hidden), and while people characterized me as an “extremely high-functioning addict” (a term I reject and a concept I absolutely don’t believe in), I was *bad,* man. I was masking a ton of misery and my level of dependence was consistently through the roof. I would have *never* been able to imagine my life as it is today. It’s definitely not perfect, but it’s just so fucking different. One of the first adjectives that comes to mind is “easy.” Don’t get me wrong; I have and continue to face lots of challenges. I can honestly say I worked my ass off to get here, and still do — personally and professionally. But when I reflect on it, I can’t even describe how much *easier* it is. I’ve re-married someone amazing, have a four-month old daughter now and my life just has so much joy in it. I’m not fighting the world, my brain and my secret everyday. Saying it’s been worth it is a massive understatement. I’d be dead, and instead I get to live this life I want. 

I sincerely wish you the best and hope you’ll go for it. If I can help in any way or answer anything, just ask. And thanks for making me pause for a minute and feel such overwhelming gratitude. 💞",8,t3_1n0z8ox

The biggest obstacle you're going to face is not going to be job interviewers or judgmental glares or any of that.

The biggest obstacle is going to be you. I say this out of a place of love and respect, not animosity, because I've been there. It's natural and normal to be anxious, worried, and afraid in your position. It would be insane not to be. 

However, don't let that fear hold you back. Don't let it control you. The more time you spend asking yourself whether or not you can do something, the more time you're taking away from actually doing it. 

You're going to hear things you don't want to; hear a lot of negativity from people. You're going to get a lot of no's. There will be times where you get your hopes up and then you get let down, whether it's your fault or not. There will be times where you get frustrated and just want to say fuck this and give up. There will be times when you wonder what is even the point; whether or not there is even a light at the end of the tunnel or if it's just an infinite expanse of black. 

I bet you will wonder all of those things, and a whole lot more, many times over the next few years. But if you take it seriously, put in the work, and completely amputate that former part of your life, then I can make you a promise: You will find yourself still asking those questions, yet slowly but surely, you'll find that the answers you have for yourself have changed.

And then one day maybe you'll be sitting there in class/at work and it hits you. You realize it's been over a week and that ever present, ever questioning, nagging voice you've lived with for so long hasn't spoken in days, a week, maybe weeks even. 

This isn't a pep talk, nor is it a bunch of banal bromides. This is as real as I can be, speaking from my own experience. There is no reason you have to allow your past to define you, nor do you have to allow others to define you by your past. 

By all accounts I should not be alive multiple times over, and many of my friends were not so lucky. I got into a lot of trouble and did a lot of dumb stuff when I was younger. I got my shit together in my thirties, finished my education, and am building a real career in a field I love at a company that's just incredible.

4820,n27e2j6,1lvbw8t,Celebrating my one year clean from fentanyl...,xzxnightshade,"Congrats—that’s huge. Fentanyl is such a dirty drug. While it does have legitimate medical uses, especially in surgeries and end-of-life care, the street version is usually low-quality and cut with all kinds of garbage. Unlike other opioids, fentanyl can build up in your fat cells with long-term use, which means it can linger in your system for weeks or even months. Some people still test positive after 60–90 days of being clean.

It also exits the system more slowly at first—sometimes taking 5 to 14 days just to clear enough to start treatment. That throws off the standard timelines most rehabs follow for starting Suboxone. With heroin or oxy, you just wait 12–36 hours. But with fent, that same window can lead to precipitated withdrawal, which is brutal. At my rehab, we had people still deep in withdrawal even after 10 days when they were supposed to be “ready” for residential care.

This forced rehabs to rework their entire protocol. The problem is, no place wants to risk giving Suboxone early and triggering PWDs—some so severe people end up in the hospital. So the options are either wait it out 5–10 days (which can feel like hell), or go straight to methadone. But when someone’s suffering and just wants relief, what are they realistically going to do?

And now, with fent being cut with benzos and other sedatives, the danger has escalated. Labs are finding substances in street samples no one ever expected. You’re honestly lucky to be getting out of this now—it’s a complete mess, and it’s only getting worse.",3,t3_1lvbw8t

Thank you for being brave enough to share this. I know it probably took everything in you to even post it. You’re not alone, even if it feels like it right now. The pain you’re in is real, but so is your strength. You’ve already done something amazing—you’re finding your way out. That’s huge. You said it yourself: you’ve got your own space, a good job, and you’re rebuilding. That isn’t nothing. That’s proof that something inside you wants to live, not just exist.

Relapsing won’t bring you the peace you’re craving. It’s a trick. A lie. The bliss it promises always comes with a brutal price tag. You already know that—your spirit is literally fighting for your future in this post.

You don’t need to be perfect. You just need to keep choosing yourself. Choose the light. Even if it’s one tiny moment at a time. You are not trash. You are not alone. You are not beyond help.
You are loved, even if you don’t feel it right now. And the world needs your story—your comeback—more than you know.

One of your triggers is your own mother. She knows you have an addiction and still gives in Everytime. 

I know you do not want to admit it but you may need to kick her out because as long as she is right there with you, you will have easy access. 

I was a heavy user and it took me quite awhile to finally quit. I had to cut a lot of people out of my life to get to the healthy place I am now.

I went to a bunch of AA meetings, then eventually transitioned to doing SMART pretty much exclusively as 12 step doesn’t resonate for a bunch of reasons. All the meetings helped me meet people who I genuinely like and talk to/hang out with regularly, and this has been integral to my recovery thus far.

Of course, keeping busy with meaningful work, trying to find other things you enjoy, practicing self care, and engaging with community can all help with recovery, as everyone says. But personally, for the first several months of my sobriety, it felt like nothing really helped much of the time. I’ll be honest, it was fucking brutal for a while. The only thing that fixed that was time. 

You’ve already made it a month in - that’s one month you won’t have to go through again if you stick this out. Do whatever it takes to just get you through the next few weeks/months/however long. Lay in bed doomscrolling all day, eat a shit ton of candy, skip school/work every once in a while if you have to. Anything but using again. Then, one day you’ll slowly start to feel like it’s all worth it, at least a little. But that’s just what helped for me.

ETA: You always have the choice to use again. What are the pros and cons of using, and what are the pros and cons of sobriety?

Ok so that’s established. Now what? Now we have to make a plan and take it step by step. Hour by hour. Day by day. 

Another problem is we want to go directly to the end. We want to be through with the wds with the PAWS. But remember we didn’t get here in one day or one week even. We dug this hole slowly everyday. So getting out is going to take as much time if not more.

At first, I remember obsessing over clean time and how long 1 month felt and how I'd never survive to a year, let alone years.

Honestly, distracting yourself and keeping your mind busy is your best bet. If you don't work, maybe look for a job? Maybe look into going to school? If that all seems like too much right now, try looking into volunteering somewhere. I considered volunteering at a local animal shelter when working during early sobriety seemed like a bad idea (I was worried about having money to spend). 

Do you have any hobbies? When I first got sober I realized that I really didn't know myself or what I liked. It might feel silly, trying to figure out what you like, but it really helped me! I got back into reading and playing video games; making puzzles and making things with perler beads also interested me.

It's hard to not have substances to make you feel alive. I thought I was going to die; I thought I was going to be a boring, miserable loser. It took some serious effort to keep myself busy and exhausting myself with being busy in order to keep my mind occupied. But then it became more natural and I was able to slow down a bit. Now I genuinely feel like I never want to drink or use drugs again, no matter what shitty thing comes up in life. You can definitely get to that point, even though I know you probably don't believe it right now.",5,t3_1k12w9g
4896,mnn78s5,1k12w9g,How do you guys do this?,PatsyClinesDaughter,"Understanding why you feel the need to use will help a lot. I remember when I was early in my recovery from H I wondered if I would ever be happy again without it/ without substances. I got on Suboxone a day or two into my recovery and while I don’t necessarily recommend it, it helped me to learn to live without heroin while relearning how to be happy and find joy without it. I was on Suboxone for 4 1/2 years and then slowly, over the course of 5 months tapered myself down from the very small dose I was on, and then stopped using it. That was 2 years ago last week. I have a job in a career that I worked my ass off for and I can’t believe it when I think about where I used to be VS where I am now.

It took a few short relapses and time for my life to get back on track and for me to come to the realisation that the idea of using was much nicer as a thought, than actually using, and you will realise this too at some point, if you are staying sober for the most part. Sometimes slips are part of you coming to your own realisations. You will notice that if you stay sober and you put effort in to things that serve you, like health, work, relationships and hobbies, your life will start to get better, as dreadful as it feels now, I get it.

I'm 36 now and life continues to pass every day whether you're clean or using. You have a lot more choices when you're not using compared to using and you're still at a point where you can decide where you want your life to go within the rest of your lifetime. It's not easy to stay sober all the time but you're on the right track. I'd give it 6 months to a year to try and live life the best you can sober or get on Suboxone and if it's still awful and miserable in a year, the drugs are always going to be around. It takes a while for your brain chemicals to balance themselves out so give it some time and you'll definitely feel better, no doubt about it.",3,t3_1k12w9g
4905,mnm8yjb,1k12w9g,How do you guys do this?,UnusualFriendship408,"A friend and I talked about how if they were more honest during the ""Don't Do Drugs!!!"" talks throughout our younger years, things might have been different. Not that I advocate for anti-drug scare tactics to try to keep kids sober, kids (and humans in general) are going to experiment, they're going to be curious, and at some point they might even actively look for an escape.


We joked about going to classrooms and saying ""You're not going to smoke weed one day and immediately become a junkie that's pawning your mom's TV and ruining your relationships. Drugs are actually pretty cool. But opioids? You're going to try them and it's going to be the best experience of your life. Nothing will beat it. NOTHING. Nothing will match the comfort and joy and good feelings you get from them. Nothing will ever compare. You'll be seeking that level of joy forever, and never be able to match it without that substance. Also you can't cum. Good luck!""


I wonder how that would have changed my perspective as a spongey-brained teenager. I wonder if it would have prevented the path I chose to go down. I understand how bad you're struggling, and I understand how painful it is. I know you don't wanna hear ""it gets better! Stick with it! It works if you work it!"" and a never ending chant of the serenity prayer. It does nothing when you KNOW nothing will match the feeling of using. 


And nothing will. 


It's a combination of the perfect feeling and how instantaneously that feeling comes on. Unfortunately, nothing will compare. But it does get better, it does get easier, and you have to believe everyone telling you that. It's a lot of fucking work dude. Therapy, behavioral coaching, and finding ways to make your brain make the happy chemicals are going to get you out of that rut. The hardest part is willing yourself you do ANY of those things, but forcing yourself into it is the first step. And having the resources for getting external help isn't possible for a lot of us.


Work through the underlying issues, the initial reason for you using in the first place. Break it down until you can't anymore, and work up from there.


You're going to struggle. You're going to be miserable. You're more than likely going to relapse. We all did, we all do. It's where you go from there that determines where you'll be. And it'll happen again and again. Just like we try to tell kids, or heard as kids our entire lives: it's okay to fail, as long as you learn. And each time gets a little easier, a little better, and eventually you won't feel so tied down by that craving. That little voice that says ""it'd be easier to use, using makes us feel good! We suck anyway!"" will get quieter.


You've got this. We're all proud of you. Have patience and grace with yourself. It takes time and it's really fucking hard. But you can do it, even if you suck at it sometimes. We all do. 💕",3,t3_1k12w9g

4939,m7225o4,1i0nzhv,One week sober ,TheSunIsAlsoMine,"Very relatable I’ve been on a journey that sounds almost identical to yours. 3 years on an off (had gotten clean multiple times during these however none of those times stuck out, unfortunately) no one knowing about it, and I was able to keep up my major life responsibilities like a job with high pay, and basic life shit, again with no one knowing or questioning anything, but I indeed started withdrawing from everyone and like you said exactly - when I did go do things I would literally just wait to get back home to my pills and doing lines of crushed powder. I lost any interest in doing anything outside of taking my dog places and making sure he has the best doggy life he could have, but really other than that I would just be looking forward to sitting just scrolling on my phone endlessly with my hand mirror and straw next to me. I knew it was a huge problem as soon as the first time I had to go through withdrawals so like I knew damn will I am a fucking addict or junkie within that first year, but I also looked at them as my antidepressants - just like you. 

I was conflicted as hell because I really did think they helped my existential depression (wrong…wrong af thought/assumption i made)  while at the same time knowing I can’t possibly expect to live like this long term and that my supply running low is always going to be a huge issue and my mind constantly worrying about it had become such an energy and time consuming monster that I was ready to just be done, but never had the will power to actually be done. I’d constantly be tapering to as low as possible - only to go up again when it was time to try jumping off entirely. 

I will go ahead and say that I’ve been on day 7 of being clean multiple times, like more times that I’d like to ever admit, over the course of just 3 years, and that it was always around then that I’d feel extra strong and motivated to stay clean and had a pink cloud phase for a few days, but PAWS always caught up with me because I never actually changed anything about my life. My environment was the same my setting was the same and I always failed and caved in because I should have focused on what and how I stay clean instead of the actual getting clean part which is the “easy” part (easy as in absolute hell on earth physically but somehow when you’re past it, you look back and don’t think it was THAT hard, but when you’re in it it’s like literally the worst thing I’ve ever experienced and I’ve experienced some nasty shit). In any case - amazing job getting here - but you should look at what led you to this path you were on, what was going on in your life (or maybe NOT going on and lacking in your life ) that got you here in the first place. Is your job miserable? Is your partner someone you don’t enjoy spending time with/around? Because whatever was there before will still be there now that you’re clean and sober and if you don’t address whatever that initial problem was that got you here - then a relapse can happen so easily - and I can say from experience it’s the most shitty thing to realize - that you’re just back to square 1 and have to do all that shit again. All that pain and suffering I did each of those times feels like a huge waste (it probably isn’t, I probably learned something from each time, but still, what a shitty way to learn). 

In any case awesome work and keep going!! Stay strong (for both of us - because I sure as fuck didn’t keep my promise to myself and will have to do this shitty WD thing again). 💪🏻💪🏻✨✨",1,t3_1i0nzhv

4950,m736zu8,1i0nzhv,One week sober ,[deleted],"This wasn’t my first time getting clean, but my previous attempts didn’t last long because the pros always seemed to outweigh the cons. Recently, I was diagnosed with ADHD, which completely changed my perspective on why I behave the way I do. My main triggers were sleep issues and overthinking, drugs quieted my brain when I needed it, with the added bonus of pleasure.

I was a poly addict for a few years, using cocaine, Xanax, Valium, and drinking heavily. I managed to quit those because I couldn’t function day-to-day, but opiates were different. They helped me sleep, gave me a warm, comforting feeling, and allowed me to wake up and function normally.

Understanding more about my body and how my mind works has given me a new perspective—almost like seeing myself in the third person. I’ve never fallen into depression during my time using, which is rare but also dangerous because it made everything seem manageable. I love my job, my family, my girlfriend—everything in my life—but I just felt like I needed that little extra.

I even tried quitting nicotine at the same time and started reading a book about it. Some of the strategies for quitting smoking applied to drugs too, and they’ve helped. Now, after just a week clean, life already feels brighter.

My program has been writing my emotions and reading stories from this subreddit. Since I quit, I’ve written around 20,000 words of gibberish. I wanted to make a post when I first quit, but I didn’t want to get overconfident and think I was done, only to relapse. It’s still very early, and I know I have a lot of work to do. I’ve looked into programs that I might start soon, but I want to make sure I’m done with it for good. I’d feel like a fraud speaking with people knowing I’m going to go back.

Again I had days in the pink cloud where I felt so strong and like I could never even consider ever touching them again and how life sober was actually cool and great and how nice it was to feel emotions and not just be numb all the time, but very quickly that cloud faded for me and I was hit with such strong PAWS that I didn’t know where to hide from my own brain. It was brutal and it’s always what’s gotten me. I could get to day 30 and then just get so depressed for a week and I still didn’t have strong enough coping skills to stop myself from running back to picking a little bit up which led to full blown relapse and to me back to square 1. It sucked. But keep it up and work on your defense and coping mechanism for those days when you hit PAWS, and you should be well on  your way to long term recovery.

We can't assume a person who just got brought back to life will be interested in or willing to go to treatment right away. Idea: There could be a mobile clinic roaming around with the narcan and slow-induction bupe you propose that is connected to a treatment place and then give the revived people a ride to treatment after they're revived and cogent.

It activates the opioid receptor in a different way than full agonists like fentanyl. In theory it gives pain relief without the same respiratory depression or withdrawal issues. But it’s not buprenorphine-class and it doesn’t block fentanyl the way bupe does, so it wouldn’t replace the bridge I’m talking about.

What I mean when I talk about the bridge is to safely transition someone onto bupe so their receptors are protected. SR-17018 can’t do that because it doesn’t have the same super-high receptor affinity or the blockade effect. It’s promising for pain, but not for preventing post-Narcan overdoses or avoiding PW.

The point of this idea isn’t about who can afford treatment, or who wants it, or what kind of facility they’d end up in. The gap I’m talking about is earlier than all of that. I'm talking about the first 24–48 hours after an overdose. That window is brutal in the fentanyl era.

The device concept isn’t about forcing recovery or picking treatment centers. It’s simply about stabilizing people long enough so they survive long enough to make those decisions.

That being said after someone recieves narcan to reverse an OD the opiod receptors in your brain are almost completely cleared, that means you could start taking suboxone almost immidiately and it should have a stabilizing effect... still feels like crap though but not as bad as being narcanned. You would need to take it regularly to prevent relapse though, getting the brixadi or sublocade shot would be the only way i can think of to ensure someone wouldn't 'be able' to use again.

I think the real issue is you can't force someone to take suboxone or get on the shot, you can give someone narcan if they are in a medical emergency but they need to consent to further meds or treatment.

Quick to clear bloodstream, but it sits on receptors way longer because it’s insanely lipophilic. That’s why people get PW  24–36 hours after their last use.

After a Narcan reversal, someone looks out of the woods but the receptors are still occupied by fentanyl fragments. That’s why “just start Suboxone right away” works for some people and not others. The timing is unpredictable.

This would be for people who want Suboxone but keep getting slammed into PW or can’t time induction because fentanyl makes the window unpredictable. Or for someone who just got Narcan’d and is very likely to die again in the next day from the same dose that almost killed them.

Vivitrol requires 7–10 days completely opioid-free, so it doesn’t apply to the window I’m talking about. The danger zone is the first 24–48 hours after a reversal, when people are at one of the highest risks of another fatal OD.

I know forcing treatment doesn’t work and I’d never suggest anything that does. This idea is about two things: giving people a safer, more predictable way to start bupe without violent PW, and creating actual stabilization after Narcan instead of sending people back out with zero protection.

What doesn’t exist is someone packaging these into a single tool or an immediate potential for profit without government money, bulk order guarantees, and insurance coding.

I absolutely agree a bernese method type of induction is necessary but it still needs to be done over days not hours. Unless you invent a new medication because suboxone is long acting with a half life of a week or more. Bupe peaks about 40min to 3 hours after dose but take much longer to fully drop, if you take .5mg every 4hrs at the 24hr mark your blood levels would be similar to if you just took 4mg once.

My point is there is definitely a way to induce bupe without causing PW and starting post narcan OD reversal is a good place to start a micro induction. The problem is the person *needs* to consent to treatment and it would be much more dangerous for them to not do it under medical supervision. The faster the induction the higher the risk for PW and with suboxone the fastest micro induction is typically dosing every 12hrs until a steady state is reached. It would be impossible to do it much faster than that and it is illegal and immoral to force it on anyone even after an OD.",2,t1_np5ng4t

the second is the idea that people want any protection post od/narcan. if they did, they'd simply check in to treatment. go to a mat clinic. something. they don't. you are worried about them dying from fatal od, they aren't. they have agency",1,t1_np5qn56

The idea is a controlled absorption delivery that avoids the blood-level spikes that trigger PW. You’re right that the current meds can’t do that… which is exactly why a new delivery tool is needed.

And for the OD group, this isn’t “forcing treatment.” For this use case it is emergency medicine that uses implied consent in the same way that the Narcan does without explicit consent. A short stabilization window isn’t treatment. It’s keeping them alive long enough so they have an opportunity to make a real choice later.

Right now we do Narcan → nothing → high chance of dying again.

IMO suboxone/sublocade should only be used for chronic relapsers or people who just can't handle withdrawals. And you're already past most of the withdrawals, so I honestly wouldn't recommend it.  

I'd definitely recommend toning down on the drinking, but I'm sure you already know that.

I honestly feel alive again after quitting and detest the idea of anything opiate related, however I do now have crippling anxiety despite taking valium but I'm hoping this will gradually fade away. 

I also now no longer live in my home country and travel a lot with my dog so its too tricky to find a semi permanent prescriptions for scheduled substances. 

I quit heroin before in my early 20s and left my country behind and never once relapsed abroad on opiates despite moving to some cities with serious drug issues. I only relapsed a year ago due to returning to my home city.

What you're describing, 18 years of opioid use tied to real chronic pain, is a brutal combination, and you're right that it makes quitting exponentially harder.

I’ve been through addiction myself (daily IV heroin and benzos), but I didn’t have the added weight of ongoing physical pain. I can’t pretend to know what that’s like, but I respect the fact that you’re still here. The fact you are still trying, and still talking about it shows strength, not weakness.

You mentioned feeling like a shell without opiates. That hits hard. I felt the same. I didn’t recognize myself sober, and for a long time, I hated who I was. But over time, that slowly changed. Not overnight, not easily, but it did.

About Kratom... if it’s what’s helping you function and stay away from the harder stuff, then it’s serving a purpose. Ideally, you'd be working with a doctor, but I get that access and trust in the system aren’t always realistic.

Please don’t isolate. Pain lies and it tells you that you’re alone, but you’re not. People do care, even strangers like me. If you ever want to talk, vent, ask questions, I'm here.",9,t3_1lxzr3w

However with the help of kratom I know longer am a slave to fentanyl or oxy. I have DDD, a torn hip labrum and spinal stenosis. There are a lot of us with chronic pain and the same stories. You need to be kinder to yourself. You have come along way and been thru too much to just give up. Find things you enjoy doing and stick to them.

5029,n2r4r9y,1lxzr3w,It’s way harder to quit opiates if you have a lifelong back pain issue,BeneficialTop5136,"I do. I broke my pelvis and fractured my neck when I was younger, which has caused tons of pain in my life. I was on prescription pain medication for 17 years, quit for four years but the physical pain was overwhelming and over those years, I stopped doing pretty much anything but going to work, because I was always in pain. I went to an orthopedic doctor, and had an MRI done, and the doc explained what was wrong and what needed to be done to help. I was elated. Until I found out that my insurance wouldn’t cover any of it. In fact, my insurance wouldn’t cover the MRI either; I had to fork out the $700 for that (took out a loan from my boss). The procedure I needed cost thousands of dollars. I felt hopeless. The doc gave me Celebrex for arthritis but it didn’t help. I tried Kratom too but it makes my hair fall out and makes me feel really, really depressed. 

After much prayer and consideration, I went to the methadone clinic and got put on methadone. I was honest with the doctor there - I absolutely had a drug problem for all the years I took prescription pain meds. I ran out early all the time, I took them when I wasn’t in pain, etc. The main reason I stopped taking pain meds though was because it was so hard to get my prescription, my insurance wouldn’t cover a pain specialist and to be honest, I wanted to see if I could do it. But the life I was living was functional, but not fulfilling. I was stable, have my own house, I pay all my own bills and make good money, but I am only 40 and not living. 

Guess what - my insurance covers the methadone clinic 100%. Aside from how messed up that is, ir was a blessing. Now that my pain is under control, I’m able to exercise, be active and enjoy life. But since the clinic controls my use, I also can’t overtake my meds. I still plan on eventually having the medical procedure I need, but it’s not financially feasible for me right now. 

Anyway, I offer this story because I used to say what OP is saying - that it was really hard to deal with an opiate addiction, while simultaneously dealing with serious physical pain. But I didn’t go straight to the clinic - over the course of 7 months, I spent so much money and time trying to address the problem without pain meds, only to be hit with financial roadblocks. I’m happy with what I chose to do though.",3,t3_1lxzr3w

I don’t think people without a chronic injury or many chronic injuries under understand what it’s like to not physically be able to get out of the bed. It is not nor was it ever a recreational thing. It was a medicinal tool that allowed you to literally walk. So it is a challenge. It’s a good place to come and just keep some positive thinking, but they are two different things.

Waking up in agony every fucking day in a horrible mood until I have just enough to function while still calculating whether I can ""afford"" to take them and last until the end of the month because long gone are the days of refills.

It's draining, leaves you emotionally dead and life in black and white, and this is just from a legal but insufficient supply.

Drugs can have very varied use cases. Your situation is one of those use cases. 17 months is a long time, and I think you've got this OP.

I think this is an area both clinicians and people in recovery need to talk about more, specifically.
 
I don’t know anything about your situation, but there are some elements I generally recommend for people in this position. 1) Have a clear plan going in; 2) Make certain the surgical and/or aftercare team is aware of your SUD; 3) Fortify the areas that have gotten you to 17 months. Whatever you’ve been working  as a program that works for you: redouble your efforts. Injuries (physically or psychic) make us more vulnerable to maladaptive behaviors, including relapse. Understanding that is important for maintaining your mental health, generally. When people really accept that fact, they’re more likely to step up their vigilance. 4) As a corollary to #1, know what the medication plan is upon discharge (with consideration to your SUD). If you must take medication home with you, I highly recommend having someone help you with administration. This can look many different ways.

I’m sorry you’re feeling fear because of this — I imagine I would, too. And I hope you’re getting healthier. You say it would be a death sentence: do everything you can to place as many obstacles as possible between that outcome and your recovery. I don’t know your family situation/support network but this is the time to lean on them. Express your fears. While exposure to opioids can bring back some feelings, if you’ve experienced a major psychic change, you are no longer that “junkie.” That doesn’t mean you don’t still have OUD, but that person you were in active addiction has evolved.

They told me exactly. 

Were you unconscious when they put the Dilaudid ? If they couldn't wake you up they couldn't do different. They have to follow the protocol unless they didn't act following the protocol, and it was mandatory to have your senses aka your consent for giving opiates. Shame on them then, knowing the opis epidemic situation. Here they just put meds and if you don't ask what you were given, you'll never know what they put.

It's incredibly how easily they give strong opis in U.S
In hospitals. In my country in EU the most you would get for such a trauma is IV Tramadol, NSAIDs, APAP, maybe some Lyrica, then when exiting they might prescribe like 1000s more NSAIDs (all meds are OTC here -except narcotics- nonetheless they like printing prescriptions to get the meds from one out of the up to 100.000 pharmacies we have) and after some months if you were not aware how catastrophic are the NSAIDs to your kidneys (never take NSAIDs more than 14 days in a row) you will come again the hospital with kidneys and liver failure.

In my case they only put Diazepam IV along with NaCl ofc. I told em I had a Xanax quiting seizure, 4-6mg per day - dk how long, every day but iirc not more than a year. I asked the  nurse, she says ""Diazepam"", I ask, ""how much"" ? She says ""please ask the doctor"". The doctor said 5mg. I said ""whaaat ?"" ""For 6mg Xanax per day I would need at least 100mg"" (~5mg Xanax) to not seize again or get in status epilepticus and then get a prescription to keep tapering, which they never did. The doctor gave me a wtf look without saying anything and just left me there to deal with other patients. I didn't seize after that, *there*. I was discharged from another hospital the next day (was transferred with ambulance, thankfully our healthcare system is everything free) without a single med and thankfully I didn't seize or had any intense WDs after getting home. The remarkable : I didn't seize till I relapsed again on benzos, and seized again after some months due to abrupt taper. My opioid dependency WDs were gone to my surprise, and my benzo WDs were lessened. That seizure did sth to my brain apart from killing a shit ton of brain cells from the convulsions and getting my brain into the CT scanner.",3,t3_1juy4ju

Otherwise, I'd say it's about habits. If I were in your shoes, I'd be sure to keep it out of my control or make sure someone is monitoring my usage. I'd keep the dose as low as possible to get through the pain. I'd use for as short a time as possible, and I'd try to keep it inconsistent, like take breaks.

That and staying busy daily was got me through the first 5 days. Each day after that was an improvement, and by day 8-9 I began feeling back to normal. I couldn’t eat the first few days so when my appetite came back I was craving food every 2 hours. Depending on how heavy and long your use was dictates how long this goes on. I stopped cold turkey, and used kratom for the severest days. If you end up in really bad shape and need help, the ER will not do much except try to send you to detox. If you found a compassionate doc you might get a script for a few days worth of clonidine/ativan but I wouldn’t count on it. also some detoxes are really poorly staffed and equipped where you’ll leave worse off, and the good ones can have a waitlist so long your symptoms may pass by the time you are offered a bed.

Hear me out. You've taken oxy before. Perhaps, many many times before. You got nothing out of it then, and it didn't stop you from using again. So perhaps the lesson that oxy won't make you feel better isn't worth very much.

There are details in your story worth drawing lessons from. First, staying clean isn't easy even when withdrawal is quick/mild because it isn't the physical dependence that keeps us going back. It's the need for drugs as a crutch to deal with what's on your mind.

Second, you got angry, you lost it, and you dealt with that anger by seeking and using drugs. The lesson isn't don't get angry, the lesson here is that you need a find better tools for dealing with big feelings. You need people you can call to talk about your feelings when they are bothering you. You need to train yourself to ease up knowing that you'll have a chance to share whats on your mind later after work. For that, you need a support network, and you'll get one on a silver platter at recovery meetings.

Reality is only a reflection of you internally. Once you realize your peace has always lived in you, you won't seek it outside becsuse it's not outside, it's inside. It always has been. What you perceive outside of you, is filtered by your perception of what's outside. That starts inside. It starts with thoughts, thoughts govern emotions. The balance of your emotions direct your perception to the blank canvas of reailty. Your perception receives through your senses. Your senses govern your movements, your words, your reactions, your actions, your non actions. Those create your reailty. 


If let your reailty govern your senses, your senses will govern your perception, your perception will govern your emotions, and your emotions will govern your thoughts. If you allow that to happen, you'll assume peace must be outside of you and you'll become anxious and depressed, Searching for something outside of yourself that doesnt exist outside of yourself.

5129,niq9ahz,1o2sdz9,I can’t get through Detox,Ok_Barnacle_2195,"1 - Never go cold turkey. Above all, it's unnecessary suffering. And suffering matters by itself, believe it or not. Furthermore, it's not even a good sacrifice for anything. Cold turkey achieves nothing but both giving you PTSD and screwing your opioid system, compared to a slow, months long taper. That is, it makes you much more prone to relapse than a taper. For some reason, tapering is the only medically recommended way to quit any dependence forming drug. It's only the bad internet advice that promotes cold turkey in favor of tapering.

2 - It's the prohibition of the opioids, not the opioids, what destroys our life. If we all could just buy morphine or oxy from the pharmacy at a fair price, there wouldn't be any crime, homelessness, drug-fueled prostitution, ODs from unknown potency, prison time, bankruptcy, job loss, family ostracization, etc. So my advice is to get on a legal opioid, the best option being kratom, and he second methadone/buprenorphine.

3 - Once you're stable on a legal opioid, spending 300 bucks per month instead of thousands, you'll realize that it was never the opioids what destroyed your life, but their prohibition. Then you can start tapering and quit, with ease, with no rush. Even if you fail (you can always try again), your life will be a lot easier, opioid dependent or not.",22,t3_1o2sdz9

A lot of people there come in all fucked up like so you won't be alone in the disaster your life has become (don't worry you're not alone - my life has become a disaster too). Don't AMA this time. Stay your ass in there. The only thing that might suck for you is that the pillows there are very uncomfortable like made of plastic and there are like 70 people in treatment there and you can only go out to smoke or vape at appointed times rather than at whim. Oh it is also really loud when all the people are awake and in the dining area but that might not bother you as much as it did me. We don't need to smoke crack man it is totally unimportant - but I get it. I live near a midatlantic city now where ready rock is everywhere. I didn't really find people using it on the west coast so much so maybe you will enjoy going to Del Mar CA and benefit from crack not being so nearby because I always found it not so much on the west coast like I had to make it myself it was not a thing I could just go buy there. 

Cmon we gotta make better choices. We can do it. I am there with you the only thing keeping me from indulging my extremely robust opiate cravings is I can't drive to the sales area of the nearby city because I got a traumatic brain injury recently and I am too lazy to walk a long distance to take a long bus ride from the suburbs.

I hate to promote suboxone or methadone but it's better than the stuff on the street. I am insane too because the impulse control part of my brain got wrecked when I got a TBI so I can relate to you a great deal.

Methadone is okay in a significant amount not the starter amount but honestly I like smoking fentanyl powder off tin foil not drinking a methadone drink or chewing on a wafer or taking a pill normally and smoking fentanyl powder has overdosed me like 30 times at this point. So I respectfully disagree for myself I do not think prohibition is my problem I think I personally got very addicted to a deadly drug that I need to not use ever again.

5149,nir44s6,1o2sdz9,I can’t get through Detox,BlackCatxo,"I’m gonna have to do a hard disagree that opioids being legalized would stop crime. Here we have alcohol as a prime example. As a legal drug, people still drink and drive and kill other people, cause huge amounts of damage, monetarily and to their life and others lives. People do prostitute for alcohol. Alcoholics are homeless. And on and on. 

I also disagree with “never go cold turkey”. Sure, i also would not want anyone suffering unnecessarily. However i think cold turkey or tapering does come down to the individual. For example, myself i preferred cold turkey because i wanted to get through the withdrawals once and for all, all at once, instead of drawing it out over time, and be done with it. There are also examples, like my friend who commented below, who has overdosed 30 times, who very much may benefit from cold turkey. That is, making a decision and a commitment to just put it down once and for all. Actually, having supply and access to taper may actually be more of a danger to this person, as if they make one decision to do more and overdose, they could die.

The state will earn a shit ton of money from taxes, and the people will get their DOC without being in danger regarding what's inside the pill (aka contamination with zenes etc). Both parties will be happy. Buprenorphine should be already yeaaaars ago available to ppl without a prescription. Take it without tolerance -> get violently sick. Take it with tolerance, it's just a WDs blocker. Nothing more. At least for me (am at 4mg/day generics), there's no high, no buzz, nothing. Only a very mild increase in talkativeness or a very slight motivation at the +2-2,5hrs post melting which lasts like an hour or two and it's feltable only if you're sitting still ? Nevertheless it's barely there, like taking e.g 1g of kratom with ultra low tolerance.

But the problem is one : Tolerance (!!). Imagine tolerance to never rise! Sounds heavenly?!
Eventually the pharmacies will need to rent a factory sized warehouse with opioids etc so a customer comes, asks for 50 packs of Oxy e.g due to tolerance and they will be selling 1000s of boxes every day. Idk how can this work. It CAN work, but if a country decides to try it, I'm pretty sure will have strict limitations with ID and getting a specific number of blisters per month.

I've never heard in my country (EU) at least of a lethal (or non lethal) traffic accident where the culprit was weed or opis ALONE. It is always alcohol, or alcohol mixed with drugs. Nevertheless, on Sunday news we hear hear usually a number of 1-10 people dying in the streets Saturday nights or towards the Sunday's morning due to going out, drink like there's no tomorrow and then drive, thinking they drive better if they are drunk.

People lives only go one direction being on opiods, I’ve never heard someone talk about how their life got so much better after getting addicted to opiods.  People rarely use responsibly, opiods are scheduled by the FDa for a reason.  Long term, people are never more productive needing To rely on a substance.

I suppose you could taper yourself with methadone from the street as well like people sell their methadone bottles regularly perhaps you can get ahold of some of those. I did a research study to get clean once that got everybody on a strong pharma opiate and then tapered us off. That was by far the fastest cleanest and easiest detox I ever did even after the ""naloxone challenge"" that was part of the study. Unfortunately I didn't stay clean for super long after the study but anyways it did work well. If you're in a town where there is crack perhaps you can also find people selling their methadone bottles and do it yourself. I know in my city there are a couple open air markets where people do sell their methadone. The methadone clinic will start you too low to use it as a taper so that probably isn't a great idea unless you want to get on methadone which would be better than fentanyl and crack I dunno.

you don’t actually have to wait two days! look into the burnese method and find an outpatient center near you who will use that protocol! it’s basically micro dosing suboxone little by little while still being able to use your DOC until you get to a high enough dose then you can stop your DOC. no withdrawal and it’s helping so many people!

you can also get off suboxone pretty easily by switching to sublocade. there’s also brixadi, but my experience was with the sublocade. i didn’t have any withdrawal and it was completely out of my system in a matter of months!

As someone who enters his 5th month on MAT on 4mg/day on buprenorphine and suffers from treatment resistant depression, could be benefited from Methadone :

1) Is full agonist -> antidepressant effects like all full agonists 

2) No danger of PWDs like Bupe, and no suffering to wait 24-72hrs to induce it. You take it whenever you want afaik, obviously not when you are already buzzed

3) No agony with wondering if PWDs will pop or not while you wait for the tablet or strip to melt. Methadone wins here.

4) Bupe needs time to melt in some ppl like me (I take 2x2mg Bupe generics and they take like half an hour to melt, terribly inconvenient 

5) Bupe can't handle the cravings that good, so methadone again wins

6) Methadone will offer additional benefits to people with OUD that have baseline depression. Bupe has also antidepressant properties, but in doses under 0.75mg and provided the tolerance is zero or almost zero. Methadone doesn't have this, so methadone wins again. It also has very mild NMDA action, plus it's a norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitor. 

Finally, I don't buy the ""Bupe is easier to quit"". Both are difficult to quit and their WDs last at least a month.

Why I'm on Bupe ? Because our fkin government banned methadone in all clinics throughout the country, apart from 3-4 facilities found in the capital city and the 2nd biggest city of my country in EU, and I don't live in either.

Also, at least in my dose of 4mg of Bupe generics, it helps depression by flattening all the emotions and you feel nothing. You also feel like doing nothing and wander like a zombie, trying to find a single thing to give you a pleasure. That's horrible. You can't call this antidepressant action. Nothing worked as good as O-DSMT for my depression. I'm treatment resistant and that was the one and only opi metabolite it helped tremendously, but with the price of crazy tolerance building.

The one and only good thing with bupe, is that tolerance builds extremely slow. The quite opposite of O-DSMT. You can be years at the same dose. So is Kratom.",1,t1_niqtjk1

5172,niutoxc,1o2sdz9,I can’t get through Detox,Ok_Barnacle_2195,"The fentanyl they sell in the street is much more prone to cause ODs than pharma fentanyl, because of 3 factors: potency variations (and unknown potency), hot spots, and most times coming mixed with another sedative from a different class (xylazine), because mixing 2 different sedative classes multiplies the sedation and therefore the risk of OD.

Still, there will always be reckless people who will overdose a lot, even on clean pharma opioids, mainly through the consumption of several sedative classes at once. That's what makes it really easy to OD, because on opioids alone it's actually kind of difficult, even more when tolerance sets in. Yet that's no reason to prohibit it. Because firstly, the damage will always be much greater with prohibition (as seen with alcohol prohibition a century ago, and even today, where 100 thousand Americans are dying per year of drug overdose, more than many wars combined, and it's also 10 times more than in the height of the pill mill days), and secondly it's just an attack on basic human rights. There will always be people who can't really do without this or that drug, and the only humane and even not-socially-destructive thing to do is provide medical treatment, not prohibition and/or incarceration.

That's bonkers. So you're worried about logistics, not enough space for all those pills? Lmao. 

Ever heard of, I don't know, bigger pills? Which should already exist btw, if it wasn't for the moral panic. After all the actual volume of the drug itself is extremely tiny. You need way more space for alcohol and tobacco, magnitudes more actually.

Also, consumption amounts tend to stabilize, it doesn't go up indefinitely. Plus, it only takes 200 euros to produce a kilogram of fentanyl, since all it takes is pretty cheap precursors. Opioid shortage would never occur, if legalization occured.",1,t1_nj38x6e
5178,nj7x8n4,1o2sdz9,I can’t get through Detox,Ok_Barnacle_2195,"> As someone who used to spend 15k a month on oxy, I can understand the thought, my issues came from having to drive all over to avoid WD, spending way too much time procuring.  But, you know what caused that need? Choosing to take way too much of an addictive substance.

That's ridiculous. Even a person on a ""moderate"" amount of 100mg of omg per day in the US will already spent 100 dollars per day, aka a full living wage.

Plus, what's even consuming too much opioids? They're not even taxing to the organs, like alcohol or cocaine. They aren't even heavily inebriating, specially once tolerance kicks in. They also don't cause psychotic behavior in big quantities like stimulants, or violent behavior like alcohol.

For some reason tons of people are on hundreds of milligrams of methadone, which is a ton of opioids,and they're doing fine. And yes, it's less euphoric, but after a year on 800mg of oxy per day you'll always be sober too.

>Long term, people are never more productive needing To rely on a substance.  Creating a system that just enables people to develop a drug addiction has no benefits.  

Of course, let's just forget all the carnage that prohibition creates, like for example the fact that currently 110.000 Americans die every year or drug OD, which is 10 times as much as in 2005, in the height of the pill mill days, where anyone could get opioids from a doctor.

Just because theoretically people wouldn't be as productive with legal opioids, even though there's even no reason to believe that that, not even that the user numbers would soar, given that in the late 19th century in the US morphine and heroin were sold over the counter yet the addicted population was half of what it is now.

Or just think of Russia, 10% of the male population are alcoholics. Imagine the benefits of prohibiting alcohol. Sure. It's just that prohibitionists never look at the costs, which are always much bigger. One just has to look at the past for alcohol, or the present for opioids.

5191,njc7fay,1o2sdz9,I can’t get through Detox,Other_Bluejay4324,"in my opinion, methadone only makes sense for those who failed multiple prior treatments. it’s a full agonist, so in reality, they’re still addicted to opiates. you can say the same for suboxone, but it’s a partial agonist, sliding it down the scale a tiny bit. 

methadone has a much higher overdose risk, along with frequent visits to clinics (due to it being a full agonist, high risk of abuse). suboxone isn’t like that, you see your doctor or get a call every month and get your script. yes you have to endure some withdrawal period before you take suboxone, but overall, you feel more clear headed once you’re stabilized. it’s also easier to taper suboxone vs methadone.

i honestly don’t think methadone is needed for the majority of addicts that want to recover. i think a small minority would benefit, but everyone else (majority) would have more benefits from suboxone. i guess it comes down to the individual. my ex used to abuse methadone, so it could be my bias showing here.",1,t1_nj3cbbn

The same with opioids, or any other drug. In a world with legal opioids, most people would just be chill at home doing their thing, not getting arrested, not getting fired, not getting blocked by their families, and specially not ODing in the completely reckless numbers as of currently - a whopping 110 thousand OD deaths per year in the US (most with opioids involved), which btw is 10 times more than in the height of the pill mill days, where anyone could easily get oxy from a doctor.

That's pure bollocks, sorry. Why is it that almost every single person on methadone is functional? Why is it that almost single person getting it from a doctor is functional?

And before you say that it's because methadone is barely euphoric, firstly there's the known honeymoon phase, which lasts a couple months on average, and we don't observe any decrease in functionality in that period. Secondly, many addicts (if not most) are so tolerant by the time they get to methadone, that they weren't even getting high anymore, just using to avoid withdrawal, so there's not much difference with methadone really.

It's more than obvious that what makes many opioid addicts non functional is the price of the black market stuff, and other issues. Barely anyone can remain functional when you have to make sometimes more than a minimum wage or two just not to remain sick, and when you're also constantly threatened with arrest, dying from an OD that wouldn't happen with unadulterated opioids of known potency, being fired, being blocked by your family, etc.

Plus there's no functional homeless people, for starters. (and it's easy to go homeless when you have to choose between paying rent and avoiding withdrawal)

>its also hard on the body

Opioids are actually much, much less hard on the body than alcohol.

>and alcohol might be legal- but people still die from it directly and indirectly, and its legality leads people to believe they dont have a problem drinking

True. So what. Would prohibition be better? That worked wonderfully 100 years ago, didn't it? 

Opioid prohibition is working wonderfully as of currently, isn't it? 110.000 OD deaths per year in the US alone, 10 times more than in 2005 when anyone could get oxy from a doctor.

>Opioid overdose is also much easier than alcohol overdose, for various reasons- legally and illegally.

Most stem from illegality really. The rest from stupidity, since if you Google the lethal oral morphine dose for an opioid naive person, it's 200mg, which is 10 times a dose that will already leave them pretty high (20mg). So I'd say that it's only really possible to OD on clean opioids if you either mix with other sedatives or consume 5-10 times as much as normal.

And again... 20 years ago when everyone could just get oxy from a doctor in the US, OD deaths were 10% of today. It's more than obvious that prohibition will always kill way more people. Because yes, there was still quite a lot of people in the pill mill days ODing due to mixing the stuff with benzos or booze, or relapsing while doing the same dose as in their former tolerance peak, but even those negligence ODs will never begin to compare to the destruction caused by street opioids mixed with horse tranquilizer and/or of unknown potency.

I wasn’t even horny or anything my brain was just so desperate for a dopamine hit that the littlest touch did it. 

Whatever you can to survive acutes, right?  Later in recovery (like months in when going through the heart of PAWS) I would say frequent orgasms works against you because your brain is trying to rewire the reward system to not rely on dopamine spikes so frequently having them reinforces the drive for instant gratification (whether that’s orgasm, doom scrolling, nicotine, etc).  But at this part of your recovery your brain and body are in fight or flight mode so whatever it takes to survive.

That's odd cause that's extreamly common since opiates make people extreamly constipated. This is TMI but whatever I havr BPD aswell so I do alot of over sharing.

I live in Tel Aviv (please don’t come for me. Im a progressive left-wing secular normal Bibi-hating Israeli like half the country…I hate telling people on Reddit I’m Israeli so now I automatically feel like I need to qualify it). The black market for pharmaceuticals is so crazy here, I really wish I knew how the dealers got their hands on the shit they sell.",2,t1_n9b04uc
5271,n9by86h,1mraqb4,Question mostly for the ladies but all welcome,seriouslydavka,Makes total sense. Pretty unappealing and not too convenient to masturbate when you’re shitting yourself and puking simultaneously!,2,t1_n9b0bwy
5272,n9bz4w7,1mraqb4,Question mostly for the ladies but all welcome,seriouslydavka,"My stomach certainly hurts and cramps but I’m really putting my body through hell while using. I don’t eat, I hardly even drink. I’ve lost a lot of weight that I had no room losing to begin with. And BPD over here too so you’re safe with me haha. Also, sucks to be us hey? Addicts and borderline! Fun combo, totally don’t passively pray for death… 

Anyway, I’m sure if I consumed more calories I’d probably get the shits. Or maybe it’s just because I haven’t let myself get far enough into CT WD for it to reach that point. Like I said, the vomiting I’ve only experienced once and was lucky enough to have my dealer show up within five minutes of the onset of puking so I was able to get well pretty fast from that point. For all I know it was vomiting that would have led to shitting🤷🏼‍♀️ but yeah I certainly wasn’t masturbating at that stage of withdrawal. 

Got my first dose of methadone today. 30mg even though everyone at clinic reckons I’ll need over 100mg. Going to be a slow and frankly very annoying journey until I get take homes. I just hope it works. The addiction cycle is bankrupting me mentally, emotionally, physically and literally like from a financial standpoint haha.",1,t1_n9b0mu7

5275,n9cv5h6,1mraqb4,Question mostly for the ladies but all welcome,MissMelissa1993,"Random story. I will never forget the time me and my ex were in bad withdrawals. I had money but we owed our dealer money. So I told him. Tell him we are suck and ask if we csn just pick up for now if he says  no, keep the money we will call someone else. He comes back says pur guy said no and made him give up the cash. So I'm laying there dying and all thr sudden he wants to have sex. I'm like WTF why would you wanna do that right now. He said maybe it will make us feel better. I really didn't want to but I was like whatever and started doing it. It had been about 4 hours since he had returned from our dealers place. Mid sexual activity I had to stop, I'm like I just can't do it. Then I got up and said I was going to get some water. Then suddenly he threw a baggie down on the bed infront of me with dope in it. At first I was thrilled and so happy, but 5 seconds later I was like WTF you let me sit here sick thinking you didn't get it for over 4 hours. Tried to get ke to have sex with you knowing I'm dying of withdrawals and I'm thinking you were too. Yet this whole fucking time you've had the stuff!... I'll never forget that. It was just such a sinister thing to do.",1,t1_n9by86h
5276,n9cqbit,1mraqb4,Question mostly for the ladies but all welcome,MissMelissa1993,"Yeah I've been on methadone for years. The constipation thing believe it or not gets even worse with methadone. So don't miss 3 doses in a row and get kicked off the program. Because you will surely get hit with that issue. Maybe not tho because usually after your first few months on methadone they asked you about how frequent your bowel moments are. And if your answer is like almost never , they give you a prescription to help with it. That's what they said with me. Back when I was on methadone for like 9 years.

5277,n9h26ij,1mraqb4,Question mostly for the ladies but all welcome,seriouslydavka,"That’s nice to hear from a westerner honestly. Not to make it about that but on the first day I tried going to the  methadone clinic this week, I physically couldn’t get there because the country was at standstill due to protests.  Before October 7th happened, which the world got over pretty quick but that’s another story, there were daily protests trying to get our criminal king thrown in prison. That all went away when the war broke out and he’s an absolute demonic fuck puppet but most Israelis are just normal nice people. Have this country has been pushing for a Palestinian state for decades. The nuance doesn’t matter. Israelis are absolute pariahs on the world stage  despite having underwent one of the most grotesque, cruel, inhumane terror attacks of recent memory. But despite our collective broken hearts following October 7th and despite the fact that we never got out hostages home even though we released thousand of genuine criminals Ike exchange for one single innocent hostage….despite all that, Bibi and his cronies are disgusting and power hunger and dangerous. I can’t view footage out of Gaza anyone because even though I know Hamas is doing what they can to further sully our image in the eyes of the world, we’re more powerful than Hamas and we should have been able to operate different. There were countless different strategies we could have gone with but not with those fuck heads leading this country straight to hell. Trust, we’re not all blind, dead, genocidal lunatics. I guess Israeli protests don’t make foreign news though. We have the world’s worst PR.",2,t1_n9g74s0

At first I was like yeah fuck you, but then I went running. I lived put on the street with him just so he wouldn't have endure it alone. In the end. He did the same thing to me a second time. Cheated on me behind my back for months. It was obvious because I'm very intuitive so for months I would scream at him to admit wrf was going on and ge would swear up and down nothing. Then one day it was just like hey I'm sick can you bring me some down. So I brought him some  he turned and had hockey's all over his neck I flipped then he dumped me for thr girl in had infact been cheating on me for months and lying to me about it, yet AGAIN. That was the one thing I asked too when I took him back. I said never do that shit again. If you meet someone else you ducking tell me and you leave.

1st:  Althought Valium is for sure something that would help with opiate withdrawal, it wouldn't take it completely away. Like your still going to go through some hell with or without anything. Benzos are great and I'm not sure about anywhere else but when I was using fentanyl in Ottawa, Canada, the fentanyl on the street was always cut with Benzos, making the withdrawal just that much more fun. Adderall wouldn't keep you from feeling the withdrawal symptoms either, trust me, if this was true then a lot more people would somehow manage to get over their opiate dependency. There is really no miracle drug when it comes to going from full blown opiate dependency to a normal and healthy state. If there was you would know it. Even Valium and Adderall together wont keep you from feeling withdrawal symptoms indefinitely until the end. The only thing that actually helped me through It with next to no ""discomfort"" lol was meth, but I also almost jumped out of a car going 150km/h because I was in psychosis but at least I got off the opiates that time, every time I felt like any withdrawal symptoms I would inject a few points of crystal. 

2nd: I didn't get back on the valium and Adderall until a month after I was released from jail. 
Also I don't take them, I sell them, or give the valium to my best friend who actually needs them for anxiety but his Dr wont prescribe. The Adderall I end up giving away to friends so I take nothing on a daily basis except my weed and sometimes a bit of jib.",1,t1_n1c9y38

Methadone can also teach you discipline, and give you structure to get started with a recovery routine. People talk about the withdrawal, but at the end of the day, I’m not worried about that.

5373,mk8cj2d,1jlv4zv,Methadone Stigma,xzxnightshade,"Awesome post. I’ve had so many patients in the past be totally against any form of MAT, for old reasons/stories they’ve heard. The issue with fent today is it can stay in your system for long amounts of time, it’s actually fat soluble… so the normal timeline for sub use is out the window.. so methadone becomes an easier option bc you can start right away. at the right dose, with therapy and the right support, it can and will give you the stability to live a normal life. 

try to read reviews on the clinic, and their rules and system. when I went, I was fortunate enough that it was a good program with solid staff and nurses. dosing hours were 5 am- noon, most of the time you were in and out in 5 mins. If there was a line, maybe 10 mins. They only allowed up to 15 take homes though as opposed to 28 at others. I once had to dose at their sister facility, and had to wait 2 hours to dose, absolute nightmare and not a way to live. So do your homework if possible so it can work for you.

But really aside from getting your dose right. The key to long term success is having a healthy life around it all. the clinics offer therapy/groups which is a good start. you have to do the work, build a new life of healthy relationships and support, find new meaning to yourself of what gets you up in the morning, having healthy ways to cope. staying busy (but not too much) helps. a lot of people want to get on the ground running from years of loss time and productivity, and sometimes bc they do that they take too much on, and crash and burn a few months later leading to another relapse. It’s better to build up on things, adding things little by little as you build yourself up and move forward in your recovery.. don’t let anyone rush you, you want to get this right and you alone can make it happen 👍🏻❤️",3,t3_1jlv4zv

5380,mk6r9a1,1jlv4zv,Methadone Stigma,[deleted],"And that's exactly what I'm trying to convey here. It's often times the first real step an opiate addict can realistically take in surrendering to the fact that they've lost control, or maybe never had any to begin with and need some medical/professional help. 

I can't speak for every addict, but for me opiate addiction was a way of life, a way to cope. I was looking for a 'fix' way before I even found opiates. So many of us think the opiates are the problem, or the root cause of our misery and instability, but truly it's just a bandaid to hide the wound gushing blood below it. We keep putting new bandaids over the old one for so long that by the time we take every other one off and see the gross, infected original band aid, we blame it for the wound being so bad and seemingly unfixable, disregarding the fact that the wound existed before the bandaid was there, and we were the ones that put it there, the band aid that is. Medical intervention from professionals and support from loved ones is the only way to heal it instead of ""fixing"" it.

Often times, we were even the ones who caused that wound, and truthfully opiates made life bearable while we figured all of this out, so I don't hate them or blame them. I respect the fact that I had anything to help at all and thank God I survived long enough to realize the problem and discoverd a real path towards solving it.

Pride is often what makes us stay in the cycle of addiction, addicted to control even in sobriety, so nothing ever truly changes, and the cycle progresses and lapses. Too many of us have passed on because of this, so I encourage anyone to toss their pride to the side and try methadone if suboxone doesn't work. Subs didn't for me personally, but they do for some. They made me irritable, restless, unable to sleep through the night, and made my skin extremely hot with bright red rashes on my face.",9,t1_mk6pivs
5381,mk79car,1jlv4zv,Methadone Stigma,[deleted],"That's the thing, some people act as if methadone withdrawal is worse than dying from street opiates, or in some recovery circles they'll silently shame or judge those who are on it, and of course there's people who literally just treat methadone as clean, extended release heroin, but it's their choice to make, and even doing that is much better alternative than chasing unregulated stret dope. At least those people are able to contribute to their lives and quell the anxiety of those close to them.

Then you have people on it who only want to stabilize and fend off cravings. Those people usually have been through enough and for long enough to realize it's a blessing to have the assistance at their disposal, while rebuilding or maitnaing their life, learning to live without a constant urge to use a bunch of times in a day, and combat any and all negative feelings with immediate gratification regardless of the consequences. 

Finally you have the people who have stabilized and are actively tapering slowly. Some people try to go too fast and feel fine on the way down until that 8th day when the rebound of reductions kick all the way in and catch up, hence why slow and steady tapers over a 8 month - 2 year period works the best realistically, for long term sobriety. And again, those fast tapers are almost always a result of societal pressure and guilt. ""I'm not REALLY clean, I can't collect key tags in NA, my sponsor wants me to wait to do step work"" etc and so on. But if you relapsed they'd be the first people to hold you accountable also. 

Thing is all 3 of these approaches beats a daily game of Russian roulette, and even the most dead set on abusing methadone, can easily become the ones who taper off years later and live entirely without opiates for the rest of their lives, but had they not got onto maintenence, they may have never lived long enough to make that change or even get the opportunity to want to change. 

That's why I say, you know what? My life is up to me, theirs is up to them. I gotta go at my pace, on my time, in my way, because I'm the one that had to live my life, and I know myself. As long as we're honest in maintenence with ourselves, we're taking a step toward the right direction",9,t1_mk6t4s3
5382,mk76m8y,1jlv4zv,Methadone Stigma,LuckyClover3,Yes 👍🏻!!,4,t1_mk6xs0b
5383,mk6n2os,1jlv4zv,Methadone Stigma,[deleted],"Agreed, tbh, as much as i respect and owe owe NA and AA and the people in it, it almost stopped me from considering maintenance. No one judged me outwardly, but I was constantly told ""no one needs to know your on it if you go on it"" and to me that made me apprehensive, and then I'd chip with fentynal or oxy instead as if that's somehow more acceptable.

Even my sponsor now seems way more distant and less willing to go out of his way to check on me and make sure I'm staying involved, which kinda just reinforces why I never took it that seriously in the past, and he's the one that told me to do it and not feel guilty, but not to tell anyone lol.. it's like wtf man.

But regardless it's my life, my path to sobriety, my decisions to live with, and as long as I'm still living to make decisions, that's a victory in my eyes. I could and probably should be dead, it's a miracle I'm alive that defies all probability. 

My ex even gave me a ton of shit about methadone too, since she's on Subuclade, but tbh, I'm glad I'm seeing all this, it really makes me realize that my life is up to me, and theirs is up to them and thank God for that. Thank God we GET to direct our own lives and thank God we DONT get to direct the lives of others",5,t1_mk6kvft
5384,mk9gtnw,1jlv4zv,Methadone Stigma,maximusjay100,"When I was on methadone I quit ALL other drugs, and alcohol too, so I was definitely clean. I had people try to tell me I wasn’t, but they really didn’t know shit. It was the first time I was sober from everything since I was like 11 or 12 years old. It’s definitely a maintenance drug, and I kinda get why people say that, but they’re just plain wrong. If you’re on methadone and have quit all other substances, you’re clean.",6,t1_mk76ds4
5385,mkovnim,1jlv4zv,Methadone Stigma,[deleted],"My advice is, definitely find the dose that works for you, and the same for your GF, and just be honest with yourself. It's really easy to let the clinic take over and just keep upping your dose until you're at like 90mgs and above, but you'll know by the end of the day if it's too much. Let them know your intentions right off the bat, and advocate for yourself! Keep in mind that many of the counselors have a lot of experience with addicts, but usually aren't addicts themselves. Some are, but in my experience, most are the ""regular"" people, so they tend to take your word for it since they really don't have personal experience. To them, if you're coming back every day and your tox screens are clean, then your dose must be right.

That's not to say you should torture yourself either, though. Going too low and making yourself suffer is counterintuitive, but at least for me, I went as low as I could stand until I felt slight cravings then slowly went back up until they went away again and I felt normal. Not high, not sluggish or drowsy, just enough to make me feel like I did before I ever got into opiates. Today, I have no cravings, and I can function normally. Instead of opiates dominating my mind, and having to remind myself to do basic things like eat, sleep at a decent time, personal hygiene, etc, my mind is more dominated by my future goals like finishing school, managing my money, yet present enough to take care of my immediate goals and still balance it with leisure and social life. 

Regardless, though, do whatever you two can do to stay away from the street and that lifestyle. Through this, you can rediscover the love you share and the life you want to build together. Rediscover yourselves really, and that's a beautiful thing to even have the opportunity to do. 

OH, also. Some guys worry about their testosterone levels when on methadone (ironic, since Opiates in general run the same risk, lol) but one way you can combat this and increase T levels naturally is with Ginseng Complex, which can be purchased at any local pharmacy, I got mine from the supplement isle at Market 32(Price Chopper)for about 15$ (75 capsules) I open the capsules and add them to tea in the morning to avoid the needless capsules. This will aid in getting your T levels stabilized without running the risks of testosterone replacement therapy. Working out and staying active in general will help, as well as eating clean, too.",1,t1_mknhq3i
5386,mkga908,1jlv4zv,Methadone Stigma,[deleted],"I think part of the stigma of it comes from the fact that there's a decent amount of people who go on it then continue to use anyway, or decide to abuse other classes of drugs while on it, which is technically easily possible to do, but to me, it makes zero sense to do that lol. Why destroy your tolerance and keep yourself stuck in a destructive cycle? Anytime I see those people at the clinic, they look absolutely miserable and are usually on the phone complaining about something, erratically pacing around with a ride waiting outside, usually state funded. 

At first I wanted to run away and not come back, feeling like the workers must automatically group us all together, but now in retrospect I feel fortunate to see that and be reminded of how out of control and rough I looked just a few months ago. People believe so many negative myths about methadone, like bone density or teeth crumbling, ""it gets in your bones!"" And this is all pretty much bullshit lol. It really comes down to the fact that there's so many people who continually abuse other drugs simultaneously, and many people coming into the clinic already had poor self care to begin with, leading to bad teeth or not getting enough nutrients daily. The people who get on as low as a stabilizing dose as needed are more likely to make healthier choices and prioritize their health",3,t1_mkg2onp
5387,mkd2szo,1jlv4zv,Methadone Stigma,[deleted],"That's the biggest point I'm trying to drive home here really, is that staying completely ""clean"" and ""sober"" almost out of spite or misplaced pride is more detrimental in early recovery than staying in active addiction, since that's almost always when people OD hard enough to die. I've seen and heard of it so many times, and luckily, I was there to revive a few people, but who knows what would have happened if I wasn't. Especially now, one nasal spray canister of narcan doesn't keep someone from falling back out anymore, specifically when they just relapsed or recently relapsed. You basically have to OD just to build a tolerance now.

Imo, that's more dangerous than actually just staying in active addiction since at least an addict maintaining everyday use has built a tolerance and is less likely to OD.
That's where we're at now, and I've tried other routes of harm reduction like Kratom, and once I went off that abruptly i was hurled into a psychosis from a year and half of pretty moderate-heavy use of it. I'm sure smoking extremely potent THC/THA and drinking a nip or 2 a night didn't help either. 

Suboxone affected me much like Kratom did also, irritability, hyperactivity with no real goal, sleep issues, especially staying asleep, and sleep paralysis often, and this was just while being on them, nvm the symptoms of getting off them.

Methadone literally just makes me feel normal, I kind of get a boost a few hours after my dose, but nothing I would classify as ""high"". I don't nod, and I don't feel a rush, I just feel like I can function without every task being an inward battle. And really the main thing is, I don't have cravings to use anything else. In fact is the opposite, if anything I crave taking care of myself and working towards the goals I put off for so long.

When I was maintaining with fent and first tapered down I kept trying to convince myself that it gave me motivation and drive, but that's really not true. Even when I did experience little boosts of ambition, I'd fall asleep half the time or get extremely self conscious to the point of isolating all the time and avoiding conversation on purpose until I ""did just the right amount"" but even then I would be clueless as to what to say and what not to say constantly questioning myself before and after dwelling on every text or call. So glad I don't live that way anymore",3,t1_mkaiy6p

5393,mm1ajyt,1jlv4zv,Methadone Stigma,[deleted],"Same, it's usually the people who wanna just move on and pretend they were never addicts, never address anything that lead them there, and oddly enough it seems to happen to the people who have literally the most support (in my experience). 

Almost every person I know who died from opiates (and alcohol) wasn't ""outcasted"" or abandoned from their families, freinds, etc and usually they'd be the ones that crossed over to ""the bad side of town"" or hung around with the ""lower"" class or town piriahs, as if they aren't anything like them. I can't count how many people I got high with that were doing crazier drugs, methods of use, and way more reckless with their use, yet somehow they looked down on me still, and honestly I think it's because the people surrounding them on the daily made it easy to convince themselves that they weren't, and that false sense of security made them feel like they could do no wrong and nothing bad would happen.

My freinds and I already knew the risks from the jump, and grew up around alot of addiction and it's consequences, so I think we respected the power of it a bit more, and we're more realistic about what could potentially happen. 

But yeah, anyway. Seems like they'd get clean for a time, then relapse, and because there was this immense shame and pressure to keep up with their ""upper class"" circle, they would use alone during a relapse and end up never waking up. At least with methadone, even being on a low dose consistently will prevent ODs a bit since there's a tolerance built, rather than just going from 0 to 100",2,t1_mlznwsd
5394,mm2f09p,1jlv4zv,Methadone Stigma,GradatimRecovery,"Somehow I feel that family, ""normie"" friends, and user friends don't really count as support.

The trouble with your arguement is that the less conservative party in america is not in power right now, and really hasnt been in a generation or more.  The republicans control the executive branch, the house, the senate, the judiciary. So democrats do not  have the power to do what youre claiming. Thats a classic tactic, to set up a bogeyman and say that theyre ultra powerful, when in fact the governing body has all the power. Its the same way that folks run for election on the idea that the government doesnt work. When they win, they ARE the government, so they are in fact admitting that they are not able to govern effectively, and in fact have no desire to do so. 

Anyway, best wishes to you. I hope we can all see that we have everything in common as humans, and resist the urge to fight eachother for the benfit of the rich and powerful.

This is so true. Our addictions try to isolate us to protect themselves. If no one else knows, the addiction is free to progress without interference. 

On the flip side, ive found that when i do tell people the truth, it feels so good. Its so scary but it feels like just putting down the heaviest weight you can imagine. I havent told every single person in my life, but in general i feel so much better since i dont have to carry secrets any more. I feel so much lighter. 

OP had a similar experience. They were concerned that they would get judgement and hate, and everyone was supportive and now theyre 6 years sober! 

Obviously its not as simple as just telling everyone all the time. But do keep in mind that the shame and isolation are a method that our addiction uses to keep us sick.

I think you already know what you need to do.

Use this holiday as an opportunity to get sober is number one.

Number two is the hard part.

You're 15, you need to be open and honest with your parents (assuming they will understand and help) and ask for that help. Whatever it is, moving hoods, changing friends, you need to do all that shit too but the first thing is being honest about what's up because then you've got people on your side. Your family will never fully understand what you're going through unless they are addicts themselves, so they won't be able to change much, but it's the accountability that will help.

After that, after you've had the conversation and been honest. Figure out your easiest ways to score and just cancel the fucking numbers and find a counselor.

  
You're young, you'll bounce back but take this shit seriously. In all honesty if you don't stop with this shit now you're in for a hard time. I've been shooting dope and coke on and off for years now but I wasn't smoking crack at 15, that's too much too fast and it's unsustainable in the long term.

Good luck, I wanted to write more but there's only so much one can handle and take in. Just know you're a good person and things will be okay eventually if you never quit quitting.

I know it's scary and probably one of the hardest things you'll ever have to do but at the end of the day your parents just want to see you succeed and do better. Even your pops wants that. It might be difficult to see or understand that at the moment but I promise he just wants to help but can only do what he feels is best. It may not have been the best for you but it's the best he can think to do if you get what I mean.

When you get home, the cravings are gonna kick your ass I'm not gonna lie to you. The thing that helped me get sober is imagining the life i want to live vs. the life I will have if I keep following my current path/choices. Get rid of all the paraphernalia. Cut off the plugs. Have your fam hold you accountable in these actions. 

You're a smart enough kid to see that you have an issue and you should also realize, the older you get the harder it will be to overcome this thing called addiction. You're so young that if you quit now and keep good and sober, your brain will get rid of these bad habits and heal so much. You said you Fried your brain but that's not true at all. If you keep doin this then ya, that'll happen in no time. If you quit then you'll heal and be back to normal in no time.

You got this man I promise. You just gotta buckle down. Deal with the uncomfortable days, the hard conversations, and get a hold of your mind. Your body will heal itself but only you can heal your mind. Its gonna be a constant fight for a bit. That makes it hard. Hard don't mean impossible though. You got this",8,t3_1hl191z

You're young so you're shapeable and you have contact to that very strong drugs. Use that sober weeks and chill the fuck up. You already realized the problem and you should turn your pissed mood on the addiction itself and slap yourself for doing that shit. You should see your vacation as a very good opportunity to do your wd which is fucked up but it will be over soon and then there is the craving afterwards you're scared of. Just become angry on that feeling and learn to hate it firstly before you learn to accept it to leave it. Your brain can rewire unlike many older people. That's just my 5 cent to that topic. I wish you to be health and stay out of misery.

I'm curious what is actually going on here. Crack has a pretty dang specific way of being consumed, and it isn't as simple as 'toss it in a bowl or joint'. 

And OP, my mom was a crack addict. The first time I stole from her stash and tried some, it was my sophomore year of HS at the beginning of the year. I was 15 as well. 

I didn't do it properly, I just dropped (what I now understand was a fucking MASSIVE amount) into a chillum with a steel screen and went to town.. 10 minutes before my ride to school picked us up on the corner. 

Probably killed most of substance because of method, but since I put so much, it still did the job. 

Thank god I did it before school while she was passed out because I spent the day obsessing about it. 100% planned on taking more when I got home. Fortunately, I took enough for her to notice, and that was the last time she left her shit out for me to easily find. 

Tried cocaine a few months later, meh compared to base. Easy to have a connect and not constantly use it because what i truly loved was norcos/oxy/morphine.

 However, I'd have been completely and totally fucked if I had a Hard connect at that point. 

Not that I wasn't already cultivating a serious opiate issue at that point, but I digress. 

My point is.. if you are actually smoking crack.. treatment is the only option here. 

Doesn't matter if people are mad at you. Doesn't matter if you get in trouble. Doesn't matter if you have to put school on hold. Literally NOTHING else matters except for treatment.. because without it, you are about to spend a difficult to swallow amount of time dedicating every part of your existence to using drugs/not using drugs.",2,t1_m3kdk2v

It’s a PTSD response and basically makes it where I’m terrified to actually fall completely asleep. Not a professional, not saying this is what’s happening, just offering up a perspective. Also: you sound like a very good partner and father OP and I hope everything works out for your little family.",24,t3_1hcwgd2
5476,m1rsa39,1hcwgd2,Ex-opiate addicts avoid sleep to obtain a nod,Strange_Television,"Thanks for this post because it's kind of startled me to realise I might be doing this on some subconscious level. Wtf. I've always been a night owl too but it's gotten pretty ridiculous the last year or two. I've been in recovery (on the bupe shot) for 3 years. I find myself staying up late for pretty much no reason, I just 'feel' like I want to. Usually sit up in bed with my laptop on me and eventually just started falling asleep sat up and ending up in that nodding position. Yet I'll continue to stay like that despite startling myself awake over and over. Eventually I'll lay down for like 2 hrs, get up, work all day and then begin it again the next evening. Its exhausting but like I said I just feel like I want to do it. Never made any connection to this before. I can't tell if your SO is purposefully chasing that nodding off thing or is that what you suspect? Personally like I said, I've never made the connection but now I read this I'm second guessing myself because it's been a weird compulsion for me across an otherwise good period of recovery. My sleep habits is the one thing I've not been able to address. Maybe this is why. Definitely going to be doing some thinking now.",16,t3_1hcwgd2

Sit her down and be like, this is what i see, this is what I think, tell me what you think. Just voice your concerns and how it's affecting you and the family etc. If you haven't done that I would. 

As someone who has severe problems with sleep, and when I quit opiates it's unbearable, I can tell you how important sleep is. Not sure if a doctor would agree with me but imho she is damaging her brain. Look a the dude who got the last genisses world record for not sleeping (before they discontinued it as an official record) ... he was never the same after he stayed up for 18 days. Had lifelong insomnia after that. I've had tremendous stretches of not sleeping, in my recollection, periods that dwarf 18 days. If it's possible at all for anyone, they should be getting regular sleep. It will improve every aspect of her life. These days I can't sleep for long, but I can fall asleep and get 2 or 3 or 4 hours so I constantly nap and go back to bed at night and get as much sleep as I possibly can. I treasure it now.

Do I do it purposely for that reason? No, not intentionally. But I wake up at 7am for work and I'm tired all day. I tell myself I'm gonna go to bed early for once. But do I? Never. I stay awake with my phone, nodding out over and over. I know I should go to sleep, but I keep reading. I've always been a night owl also and it's like a soon as nighttime comes, I'm awake. Even if barely. 

Now I will say this. As it could mean maybe the same thing for her. If I'm not like so tired that I'm nodding out when I go to sleep then I can't sleep. If I just decide hey I'm going to bed and put my phone down and close my eyes then my brain starts racing and I always end up picking my phone back up just to get out of my thoughts and distract myself. I prefer nodding off to sleep and falling asleep without realizing I'm actually going to sleep because it leaves no time for my mind to race.  Sometimes even when I'm nodding off and think I can fall asleep, just the time it takes to put my phone on the charger and get comfortable is enough to wake my brain back up and then I'm back at square one.

I don't know why I didn't want to repeat myself, since I am sharing experience- but, habits I guess.

Alas, I HAVE experienced this, or something close to it. I stay up, sometimes, or often, later than intended.

But a lot of times I forget to even set the boundary for what time I would like to be aim to be asleep by. (And even,. WHEN I do set that boundary for myself, well I don't think I have ever actually achieved it.)

Can't remember a single time

I have always been this way. Since before using. As a child I remember being this way. There's a lot to why I think this is.
Just to give a little more perspective. I think it's partly due to poor impulse control,. enjoying my time awake so much.
And a little bit poor discipline. Like that's probably my smallest issue. 

And also a bit of a sleeping disorder, (neurological), I don't sleep right unless I get to the right state. And I think there is something on a spiritual level too, but I don't know how to explain it,.and not entirely sure how to fix it, for myself even, and obviously for your partner.

Feels similar as with benzos, the main thing I notice in regards to opioids enhanced effects is the sleepyness they cause.

Also interesting that a lot of people with social anxiety also say they like being sleep deprived cause it dulls the anxiety. Idk.

I really like feeling sleepy in those regards.. less anxiety, feeling more high. Less awake, more ""numb"" to the world..

So I do this often. I enjoy the feeling of sleepiness and so I too fight my eyes closing- for an hour or 2 at most, and then I go asleep. For some reason when i fight falling asleep for an hour or 2, I'll get into a deeper, longer sleep, so its that aspect too for me. I'll also tell you that if i fight my sleep any longer than that, I then wake up and can't sleep at all. So even I cannot level with the extent your partner is doing this too, and I'm sorry to say I think there's a wee bit more to ""fighting her sleep"" if she's nodding off at the table and sleeping all day. None of that screams recovery behaviour to me, I'd be extremely worried if I were you.
I'm sorry to say it again, but I think you need to question those MH meds. And if they're being mixed with anything. Booze, other pills, weed - anything.

You mentioned that part of what she is doing up is doomscrolling. Is it possible that this is just a technology addiction? Like, she gets stuck into whatever she's doing on her phone / the internet and the constant stream of new information is created a new type of addiction for her that's difficult for her to disengage from? Just another suggestion to put out there. I second what others have said about talking to her. 

I will add that I started reading the comments here because I have been in a similar place recently. I have been about 7 years clean, and didn't use to have a problem staying up too late until the last couple years. Recently, I will stay up until the very last minute and often will nod out while still sitting up in bed. It feels a little bit like a compulsion up as late as possible rather than settling in when my body really wants it. I am also a lifelong opiate addict in recovery.

With that said, for me personally it might be more about having really busy work days and then wanting to maximize my personal time as much as possible in the evenings before going to sleep. Maybe this is also what is going on with your partner?  she is so busy during the day with your child and other responsibilities that she wants to maximize that time she has alone by herself with herself?

It took many, many tries to make it this long clean, but I am SO incredibly grateful to be able to say I haven't used any drugs (except medical marijuana that helped immensely, and a very, very needed anxiety medication), and have been clean for over 2 years. With every attempt at getting clean, the withdrawals caused an extreme lack of sleep and insomnia that I had never dealt with in my life up until that point in my life. In early detox/recovery, sleep was by far the most important thing to me at that point, so I NEVER fought ANY form of sleep. Even 2 years later, my insomnia still hasn't completely improved, and so I still value my sleep more than I ever had in my life because of the YEARS I spent lying awake alone at night, sick, incredibly depressed, along many other things...

Sounds so weird to say, but this has been greatly affecting not just her, but our family. I’m nowhere near perfect so I’m not trying to bag on her, but I do believe sleep is necessary. 

It mostly started with her being a night owl, our sobriety started July 2020 so right in the midst of Covid, neither of us employed and both living off unemployment funds while taking care of a newborn. We were very fortunate. As time went on , I’d say roughly 2-3 years sober, I started noticing her intentionally saying up to late hours. She used to stay up late (12-2am) to do housework like dishes, cleaning, laundry etcetera then she’d want to doom scroll or whatever until the early hours. 

I started taking over those responsibilities (with the exception of HER/my kids laundry because her laundry is all delicate shit that confuses me) to pitch in cause I noticed she was staying up so late. Gradually as time went on I’m doing all of this stuff and trying to give her the ability to go to bed at a decent hour, but she resists and would rather stay up all night. 

Not sure if that makes sense, but long story short for this reply is that it didn’t start how it is now. It gradually got worse and worse and we’re at a point where I’m not get of could get worse , but due to myself being a major drug addict and knowing how things can go, it getting worse is certainly somehow possible.",3,t1_m1rkjdl

5534,m1s8vq2,1hcwgd2,Ex-opiate addicts avoid sleep to obtain a nod,iminsalestoo,"Yes I have directly addressed it to her multiple times and tried to set up a plan. It has only recently gotten very worrisome. I’m very aware of the damages lack of sleep can cause as you described. I have been homeless on meth benders for years at a time where I would regularly go 7-18 days on little to zero sleep and I’m positive it’s greatly affected me. 

It’s almost like it’s another addiction, like she has to break this habit all over again. It’s very hard to understand from my perspective and I’m sure from the general public’s perspective which is why I came here to the “opiates recovery” section of Reddit to see if anyone else has some type of shared experience and how they might have dealt with it.",4,t1_m1s7rh5

5536,m1sewvz,1hcwgd2,Ex-opiate addicts avoid sleep to obtain a nod,iminsalestoo,"Thank you for the thoughtful post and thanks for sharing your experience. I think this is probably the most on point post I’ve seen and it’s the most relatable to my perception of her experience also. We both have loads of trauma / guilt / ptsd from our drug use , I always thought it was mostly me carrying it as I was the one who dealt with the obvious and visible type of trauma, but it’s easy for me to forget all of the other trauma we as addicts experience during our addiction .  

The most notable difference between yours description and what I’m experiencing with her is when wake up time happens at 7am. From my view she is incapable of waking up via a traditional phone alarm on her own at 7am . Luckily, like I said in another post I am an early riser and I wake up at 4-5 am so I go in there to physically rouse her, but if I wasn’t there and she depending solely on an alarm I’d think she’d sleep through it. 

Regardless it brings me some comfort that others are going through something similar. This was extremely foreign territory for me when it first started occurring, but I always felt like this was a byproduct or some type of addiction/recovery related symptom for opiate addicts in recovery.

Without a diagnosis that means jack of course, but it's interesting to me if this is potentially an ADHD characteristic. Which do you feel its more related to? 

Its truly the weirdest thing, my whole body will be screaming out for sleep but I just fight it and refuse to lay down, even if I'm feeling kind of unwell from the exhaustion. At some point I start nodding off and shutting down involuntarily then jolt awake as my head lolls, then repeat. The time gap I allow myself has slowly gotten wider too. I used to feel like after 3am was ok to lay down, now I'm at 5 - 6am. Wake up at 8:30am for work Mon-Fri. Weekends I make it all up and sleep till 2pm. I somehow still manage to get shit done and am even being praised for my work all the time. Imagine what I could do if I didn't have this ridiculous compulsion around staying up 🙃 Its definitely not an opiate nod feeling at all but there's something about it when you're just the right amount of tired so that you can't resist any longer.

I personally can recognise i have a sort of expectation of being able to sleep with a snap of my fingers after using for so long. and the fact that it is something i struggle with all the time now kind of leads a person to a weird place i guess. there is issue with having poor rest or night terrors as well, so it could be your SO is avoiding something deeper in a similar vein, especially if she's got here so gradually. 

I wish u and your family luck. this is a very strange and equally tense situation to end up in, but i really don't know what i'd reccomend if not just a more attentive psych/therapist combo. it does not seem fair, the kind of burdens you're dealing with by yourself. i feel for u for sure",1,t1_m1s27i3

Im 100% certain if not for him that I probably would not even have my job anymore. Waking up has always been an issue for me though for as long as I can remember. It's one thing that I've always hated about myself. My all nighters have never helped either. 

But yeah, I guarantee it's probably something like what I deal with and just not wanting to think about stuff. Not sure if y'all had children thru your addiction, but if so then I'm sure you know all the guilt that comes with that and then just well, you already know, addiction is rough. Im 3 years clean this past July, still on Suboxone, but I feel like the longer I'm off drugs the worse the thoughts get. When using, you didn't have to deal with all that and if you did think about stuff then it wasn't for very long. But after years being clean and never getting a break from these thoughts. It all seems to pile up.

 I have gotten worse about always needing my phone as a distraction. I'm sure it's definitely not healthy. My hands and wrists are starting to hurt a lot. But I don't know how else to deal with it right now. I just know that when I lay down without my phone and I can't sleep, I will start to go crazy. I'm actually considering therapy.

Then several hours later when it's getting daylight outside, then I'm finally ready to go back to sleep, but I can't. Or it's only for 45 minutes or something. Either way, I can never seem to just get a normal, decent night's rest and wake up refreshed. 

But yeah, I think you're right. It probably could be remedied if certain habits were changed or forced instead of just doing whatever the hell I wanna do and doing what I should do.

According to my Reddit homework lol, I was maybe on too low of a dose so I've been experimenting with dosage and it's still probably too soon to tell.

And moreover it’s the resistance to sleep. It’s strange, like it’s not insomnia, she can sleep if she wants to, it’s like she is preferring not to sleep on a subconscious or even semi conscious level. It has always seemed to me to be some type of mental health situation related to prior substance abuse . Like a post acute withdrawal or chronic long-term withdrawal symptom. Idk it’s got me dumbfounded and her psych has shit-all to say about it besides prescribing her fkn Prozac and asking her if “anything has changed this month”.

I do think a great idea would be for her to get a new psych, but that’s not why I’m here posting this thread. It’s mostly cause I’ve never experienced, heard or seen anything like this and have found mostly nothing online about anyone else. So I figured I’d give Reddit a shot to see if collectively anyone else has experienced something similar . 

I know this is a very strange and peculiar situation and if I were reading it I would easily jump to the same conclusions as everyone else, which is why I’m really only looking for  about 3 things:

I know this isn’t a result of current substance abuse

By no means am I looking for a cure (although it would be great if someone had a simple fix, I’m sure we’ve all learned there is no simple fix to mental health or substance abuse)

I’m here to see if anyone has experienced something similar

Trust me I’m open to anything that will help me feel better. I only recently got on subs. I was probably in a type of withdrawal (something we probably don’t even know of yet considering there’s little data on ppl testing positive for fentanyl 2 1/2 months after stopping) and little studies on inducting ppl from tranq dope to subs. I’m always researching here and also studying anything I can get my hands on. I haven’t dosed yet today and my nose is runny and I’m on my phone in bed delaying leaving to go out to my bf apartment because I have zero motivation. Part of me thinks I just hate being clean. I know that other opiates damn even tramadol could get me up and going. I just don’t get that from subs. My depression is through the roof, I’m lazy af, but I don’t have many withdrawal symptoms like I did before. You could be spot on. I’m going to give myself a few days at my bf place relaxing and not taking subs. Then I’ll dose myself 8mgs on Monday to see if maybe I feel a difference? Who knows really

I suppose it would make sense she could be doing it to feel how she used to before recovering. I'm not sure if you've talked to her about it yet or if you wanted to check online before confronting her about it. Talking to her could be a good idea so you can get her side of things. Maybe it's subconscious and she hasn't noticed that she does it? Either way, after reading about the state of her psych, I would recommend finding her a new one if at all possible. Throwing Prozac at a patient (ex-addict none the less) for nodding off and only asking ""any changes this month"" seems like a bandaid fix for what's going on with your gf.

I can do 3-5mg a day, but a total of 1-2mg, and you still have traces of fentanyl alkaloids showing up your system- idk girl that sounds uncomfortable! I know someone that did it. (Male).  Shoot, I have done it. But it was not comfortable. Not when doing it quickly, and you are doing it quickly!!

See when I had the runny nose, I realized something was off. 

I don't know, maybe you DO like being clean and your body is sort of rejecting that low dosage. That's what I feel like happened with me. It was hardly enough and the body is just metabolizing it??

Anyways, why stop the dose altogether? When I was newly clean and I would do that for a day, that's often when I would end up using.

Go back to 8. I know that's a big jump and feels counterproductive but stay feeling like you are and the chances of using go up massively.

Like my bf always says, just be happy you’re alive and didn’t die relapsing. He’s always telling me to be easy on myself.

Anyhoo….. I kind of “brightened up” a bit. More interested now in my surroundings and not so in my head and depressed. I’m so used to “feeling” different. It’s really crazy how these drugs can fuck us up. I definitely trust suboxone cause like I said it’s not noticeable. If I’m truly uncomfortable though and then take a higher dose I notice the uncomfortable feelings go away. I still have all the time in the world, I’m not in a rush… I guess I don’t want to be let down. I don’t want to trust the medicine too much. Deep down I know the real work comes from me, and I’m a naturally lazy person that used drugs to give me motivation. Now I need to motivate myself without them.

I tried many, many times and only after destroying my life multiple times over 10s of years did I come round to the idea that maybe my brain chemistry had changed so much and/or my trauma was so big that I needed a little bit of opiate to be okay. I still think this is the case for some people
I was on the buvidal injection for a while and it gave me my life back and from there AFTER a period of stability I swopped to low dose subs and did manage to get off them successfully. (Touch wood) But it's really helpful to have a safety net when you first stop using. Slowly. Slowly slowly cut down. I really truly understand why you want to do it quickly but your brain, if it's like mine, is tricksy. It doesn't want me with anything in my system that would stope getting high if I choose to.

5622,m24b27k,1hcwgd2,Ex-opiate addicts avoid sleep to obtain a nod,FinancialEye7877,"I have this conversation so frequently with my bf. We are both ex heroin addicts, H our DOC. I got clean in the 90’s - got married had kids - did the society thing 100% clean. Then divorce came and I did ridiculous amounts of codeine (sounds pathetic, I’m one of those that’s highly sensitive to codeine and get super high) of course I thought pills no big deal. I weaned off the pills. Then I found tramadol, again only pills. Then tapentadol again only pills. I quit the pills by weaning very slowly and I was pretty good at it. I then became an alcoholic (I hate alcohol but it’s also socially acceptable) My kids were troubled by my drinking and I felt like a shitty parent so I got help, detox and rehab. I met my bf at rehab and he was ex heroin addict. I started doing his methadone and that worked for 3 years. Then my father died and I copped in April and lied to my bf but of course he knew. We always talk about the trauma that heroin addiction put us through and how we truly feel our brains are permanently changed. I’m happy though that I feel a teeny bit better after taking the 8mgs tonight. I know when I want to relapse and I don’t—— it was so hard to go through withdrawal this time (the body keeps the score) it’s like our body remembers more than our brains do or they’re both so damn good at remembering the pain and suffering. I’m sure you know what I mean. The first time I detoxed I swore I would NEVER touch H again. I went 23 years not touching a street drug. But it really is true what NA says. However I also truly believe in harm reduction too. I’ll be honest with you, if I could be prescribed tramadol 200mgs for the rest of my life, I’d take it. It’s used for depression in Germany I believe or Sweden. I must have that CYP2D6 enzyme that breaks down tramadol because it definitely made me more motivated, lifted my mood, anti depressant qualities, gave me the urge to live well. It’s all about what can help me and not hurt me too much aka harm reduction. Because I did have a long amount of clean time off H, before codeine, but I was not participating in life. I was depressed and in and out of psychiatric hospitals. So, I’m fine totally fine being medicated if it helps me. And I know I NEED help. Slowly my surroundings are becoming deteriorated just like my insides. I used to keep a really nice home, people would compliment me and even ask me to help them organize their homes. Now my place looks like shit because I feel like shit. My 81 year old mother does more than me. I know I fucked myself hard this last relapse. I told my bf, if I’m not better in 6 to 9 months, than I think I should go back on methadone. Thank you again and I feel bad occupying OP page. I know from all the research I’ve done the past 24 years, that I may suffer from something only MAT can fix. I’m just unsure the current MAT drugs may not be as effective for people like me (us). You know those that have maybe indulged too much and did too many. I don’t know the answer and I’ve tried everything from fringe spirituality that is borderline cultish to antidepressants to heroic doses of psilocybin.

I couldn’t even take one second to listen to what they had to say. Before my eyes were even open it felt like I was being electrocuted. I was choking on my own vomit before I could even take a breath. By the time I could get a breath I was yelling for them to get out. They said I could die if I didn’t go to the hospital. I think I said they could die if they didn’t get the fuck out of my house. (Not my proudest moment) I was shaking violently and dripping sweat and felt ice cold. My body hurt bad. I couldn’t see clearly. I couldn’t function well enough to smoke so I dumped a bag on the top of my dresser and kept snorting until it felt like I could breathe normally. Horrific moment.

5633,nrb0ktx,1p8xkgd,Being narcaned mental part is like being in upside down in stranger things,SpenseRoger,"Just an FYI with precipitated withdrawal both the physical and mental effects are wild af, it can be such a bad trip like wow. A couple times I had it from getting bad batches of dope and it really did have a psychedelic evil quality to it.

 However normal withdrawal even cold turkey, even after a decade of using, at least in my experience, is nothing at all like that. There can be a bit of a feeling to it but it’s nothing at all like the greyness to life before. 

What’s even better is after withdrawals I’ve never met a person who didn’t describe being opioid free and their recovery as being better than they remember and better than they imagined possible. I’ve met people whom are still struggling in sober life but I’ve yet to meet someone who didn’t eventually get to that point, 

In my case normal cold turkey withdrawal reset me in many ways to a state better than new. I could smell like never before, I had vivid dreams and day dreams, motivation and stamina, laughter and wow did music sound good. After not long food was so good and sleep became amazing. 

What I learned by a few forced withdrawals when I wasn’t ready and had no hope of getting any more for weeks was that the physical suffering of withdrawal is at least 80% psychosomatic. In other words 80% of your subjective physical symptom intensity is driven by your mental state. If you’re sitting there obsessed with thoughts and decisions about using again you’ll be so damn sick it’s unbelievable.

 Once you accept you’re not getting any more it’s just some annoying symptomology you can mostly treat with comfort meds. That’s a strong statement but ive experienced the symptoms abate like that multiple times in my life. 

The mental suffering during withdrawal, and especially after, well ya once you’ve found your meaning and purpose, your personal moral philosophy, developed some willingness to say yes and daily discipline to do, and finally truly accepted that no matter what you’ll never ever, ever touch opioids again in your life… well, it’s akin to a spiritual experience. All the physical and mental suffering is just embraced and overcome, what was once impossible is now easy. Over time you build up your capacity and you take on more than you ever thought possible.

anyway, YES it was very terrifying i felt like i had done nitrous but also was very anxious at the same time. like the come up of a psychedelic type of anxiety times ten mixed with nitrous??hard to explain as you said. uncontrollable crying out of nowhere bc of the confusion. i remember asking what’s happening a few times before i finally asked if they gave me narcan. 


i was extremely fucking pissed off at the nurse but managed to keep it together for the most part bc i had no other (decent) options at that point. fuck incompetent staff. sadistic or incompetent idrk but yeah the feeling was one i wont soon forget, an it was 8 years ago. i got clean finally in june 2024. we do recover.",2,t3_1p8xkgd

The problem is I do not remember what dosage I was on, so please do your own research, before trying my method. For all I know they’ve decided that method is incredibly dangerous and should not be done but a few years ago it was online and I want to say I had to take somewhere around 40 mg of buprenorphine with the naloxone. It’s just that logically Suboxone is used to get you out of withdrawals and if you’re in precipitated withdrawals, I thought to myself does it really matter why I’m in withdraws Suboxone help me and the answer when I researched it and when it happened to me was yes Suboxone will help you get out of those precipitated withdrawals.

But like you said, the mental battle is where it gets real. For me, psilocybin helped me get over some deep pain I didn’t even realize I was still carrying. It wasn’t a magic cure, but it cracked something open; gave me perspective, helped me let go of guilt and shame I’d been dragging for years.

Nobody talks about this enough in recovery spaces. We hyper-focus on the physical withdrawal, but that’s just the first hill. What comes after is where most people get stuck.

For instance, where I live, they only allow a certain amount which is more for individuals that are facing depression. If they have an individual that is trying to conquer severe chronic pain, as well as readjusting some base level wiring than ketamine has proved to be a very good option. Unfortunately that it’s just not the same in every state. It’s not even the same in every city. Insurance is definitely railing against it just like they will with medical MJ. Now with most states railing against even The things that were allowed under the hemp bill we are just did a very, very weird place. I know again I try not to post in this particular thread about chronic pain patients because there is somewhat of a difference. However, chronic pain patients are really getting pushed into a very, very narrow quarter. Some of them are not trying to help recover because they simply cannot function without the assistance of some sort of medicinal relief. So that is somewhat of a different topic but when it comes to withdrawal, everybody plays the same game I don’t care whether you’re a chronic pain patient or someone who started down this path for recreational reasons. We all still end up with the same difficult path. I’ve heard ibogaine,  ketamine as well as psilocybin. One would think if this was a major concern just for tolerance breaks and quality of life they would do breaks and try to get some ketamine sessions in whilst reducing quantity. Also Ibogaine, although I don’t know that that’s FDA approved. Even though of course, medicinal MG is not medically. FDA approved either. At this point in time it is all a guessing game. You almost have to just simply advocate for yourself. Even to the point of maybe even putting your own plants in the ground if you think it will help you get through your one life with quality. Unless anybody knows different than me it is only one life.I know this ate. Shot also does very well for withdrawals.

5685,n1f3d3w,1lrs0ph,Kratom helps with withdrawals… Psilocybin helps with staying clean why is no one mentioning this ?,ghost-_-dog,"Tbh I feel like everyone who opens the doors to drugs in their own lives should absolutely experience psilocybin at some point, like, almost as a requirement (not really but let's imagine together). Doesn't have to be a full on trip, but some kind of dose, period. 

I genuinely feel like there would be a net positive benefit to modern human society if every drug-using adult at least micro dosed psilocybin once in their life. 

I really liked how, for me, psilocybin made everything feel significant and purposeful. The way the light hit the leaves on the tree I was walking past.. the way the breeze messed up my friend's hair and reminded me how grateful I was to have them in my life.. small things. It wasn't an addictive feeling for me, it just refreshed my perspective. 



But it's still inherently risky to suggest an addict try another substance to solve the problem of using a first substance. 

That's why those of us in recovery don't generally recommend ""helper meds"" that some people use as their DOC. The risk is too high that you're just introducing someone to their next addiction. 

There is no such thing as a 100% safe or non-addictive mind altering substance. The human mind is a wildly complicated thing, and because we all have such different experiences, what's harmless to you (no withdrawals , easy to step away from, etc) could absolutely be psychologically addicting to someone else due to circumstances you can't predict and that ""someone else"" may not even be aware of until they're in too deep. People get addicted to the weirdest and most mundane things. 



All of that being said, I do feel like kratom is still too much like most other mind altering substances to be something i'd ever recommend to a fellow addict. It tends to make you very selfish over time, just like harder drugs. But because it seems to be benign as you're using it, it's easy to justify continuing. 

I agree that it's a helpful tool for withdrawals but it's also a very dirty substance that touches so many different receptors that other drugs do not. For those who are exceptionally in tune with how substances affect different parts of their conscious experience, the withdrawals from kratom -- because it touches so many things in your brain and chemistry -- can be so so much worse than harder drugs that leave your system sooner. 

Kratom is also sourced from countries with lots of heavy metal soil contaminants -- even if your online bulk supplier assures you it's clean or tested, etc...

Much like harder drugs, kratom withdrawal can also have very long PAWS. It was so much easier for me personally to quit morphine, Diludad (hydromorphone), oxycodone, cocaine, ketamine, research chems..than it was for kratom. 

I know that I'm not everyone else. Everyone else isn't me. Many people have gotten off kratom successfully. 

**I don't ever want someone to come to this forum and think that any of these ""helper"" substances are 100% harmless.** That's how I got into kratom in the first place. I was looking for legal, ""less harmful"" drugs. 

The fact is that none of us really know what we'll get hooked on at whatever point we're at in our lives (remember, drugs fill a void -- you may do a drug once or a dozen times without issues quitting but try it again 5 years later and your circumstances have changed and you can't stop anymore).

I used psilocybin in the first couple months after quitting but I found myself using it as a recreational crutch and not a therapeutic tool even though that’s how I intended. I took microdoses and they brightened my day, I tried a couple of trips but I couldn’t get in an introspective mood with them, I just had fun. 

Admittedly I was taking the once a week or so (sometimes 0.3g sometimes as much as 2g) and when I stopped I realized I probably held my progress back a bit because I went through a period of emotional blunting as my serotonin receptors resensitized (at least I think that’s what happened could have been PAWS too or a combo)

I continue to stand by what I've said in the past - psychedelics have helped me open my mind and perspective and see that I don't need the drugs in my life anymore.

Kratom isn’t perfect, but it can be that lifeline when you’re stuck between pure survival mode and getting back to some kind of balance. I’ve seen it with myself and others — it keeps people afloat when they’re drowning in withdrawals.

But yeah, the mental side… that’s where most people relapse. You survive the physical withdrawal and then you’re left with years of suppressed pain, guilt, shame — it hits hard. For me too, psilocybin cracked that wall open. It’s not a magic fix, but it resets your perspective. I let go of things I didn’t even realize were weighing me down.

And you’re right, barely anyone talks about that part of recovery. The focus is always: “Get clean, survive withdrawal” — but nobody warns you about the mental emptiness that follows. That’s where most get stuck, I’ve been there.

5702,n1izksr,1lrs0ph,Kratom helps with withdrawals… Psilocybin helps with staying clean why is no one mentioning this ?,Decent-Fun190,"Great points! Love seeing people talk about this from different angles, especially when it comes to tools beyond the typical meds.

Quick note on the difference between ketamine and mushrooms though — both can support neuroplasticity, but they work pretty differently. Ketamine is a dissociative, often used in clinical settings, and it rapidly influences glutamate pathways. It can help 'reset' depressive loops, some say even addictive circuits, but its effect is short-term and usually needs repetition. It's also more accessible in controlled environments compared to things like ibogaine.

mushrooms (psilocybin) work more through serotonin pathways (mainly 5HT2A receptors) and seem to trigger longer-term rewiring, especially when combined with proper integration work after the trip. They aren’t a quick fix, more like a mental reset button, but the real change happens after, during the work you put in integrating the experience.

As for ibogaine.. that's on another level entirely. It’s probably the most hardcore option for addiction interruption, especially with opiates. Some report it stops withdrawal symptoms almost instantly and resets addictive behavior, but it’s also very risky. Heart complications, legal issues, and lack of standardized treatment make it a last-resort tool in my opinion, not to be underestimated and I personally don't recommend it. 

Totally agree though: whether it’s chronic pain or addiction, it’s all the same brutal path when you try to break free. Psychedelics, ketamine, even growing your own tools.  it’s all part of finding your own roadmap. But nobody should expect a single trip or treatment to magically solve everything : the real work starts after.

Stay safe, advocate for yourself, and yeah if you find your tool, rock on and never look back!",3,t1_n1fouco
5703,n1d9sxs,1lrs0ph,Kratom helps with withdrawals… Psilocybin helps with staying clean why is no one mentioning this ?,Decent-Fun190,"No, that’s not how it works. If you take mushrooms every day, the effects quickly diminish due to tolerance  but that only applies when you’re taking high doses, and assuming you’re supposed to trip constantly, which isn’t the point at all.

For proper mental integration, you should leave at least 1-2 months between full trips.

That being said, there are millions of people — especially in high-performance environments like finance and tech — who microdose 2-3 times per week for improved mental clarity, focus, and overall cognitive performance.

Personally, I needed three proper trips to fully get heroin out of my system mentally and reset my brain. Now, I trip maybe 2-3 times per year and microdose in between.

I lead a team of engineers at a company similar to TSMC, where we invent and help build next-generation computer chips. One smal mistake on the job can cost millions of dollars.

Let me be clear: nobody should expect mushrooms to magically free them from addiction, it doesn't work like that.

First, you need to go through withdrawal, stabilize, and prepare your mind properly for the mushroom experience. Only then can psychedelics play a role.

I personally don’t recommend taking mushrooms within the first month after your last dose of whatever substance you were using.

And just as important : the integration process after the trip is crucial. Psychedelics without integration are just another temporary escape.

The emotional blunting after makes total sense too. Microdosing too often can definitely mess with your serotonin system, especially when your brain’s still healing after quitting opiates. I’ve heard a lot of people describe that flat, disconnected feeling — could’ve been that, could’ve been PAWS, maybe a mix like you said.

One thing that really helped me with that emotional flatness was Lion’s Mane. It stimulates Nerve Growth Factor (NGF), supports neuroregeneration, and helps repair serotonin and dopamine pathways damaged by opioid use. It’s subtle, but over weeks, it can reduce brain fog and help your mood and mental clarity bounce back.

Honestly, after opiate use, I think it’s a really good idea to start with a few weeks of Lion’s Mane (non-psychedelic mushroom) before jumping into psilocybin. Give your brain some foundation to rebuild firstw I noticed way better results that way.

That being said w pretty interesting that you don’t have cravings anymore though. Even if it didn’t feel therapeutic in the moment, maybe the psilocybin still worked under the surface long term? Resetting those pathways slowly, even without you realizing. Wouldn’t surprise me honestly.

Of course, it’s a very personal decision, but I always think: why not try? (As long as you don’t struggle with serious mental health issues.)

You don’t necessarily have to quit kratom before using mushrooms. You could give it a try.  maybe it shifts your mindset, and you no longer crave heroin after you quit kratom. That’s exactly what happened to me.

Or maybe it doesn’t give you the insights you were hoping for — but at least you tried, right?

First week , don't just replace oxy with kratom. Oxy is some strong shit. 


Week 1 : 


Day 1–3:

Morning: 5 grams Red Bali

Midday: 5 grams Red Bali

Evening: Drop your Oxy to around 75mg max (split however works for you)

You’ll still feel some withdrawal creeping in, but way more manageable than raw quitting.



Day 4–6:

Up the kratom slightly
Morning: 7 grams
Midday: 7 grams

Drop your Oxy further, aim for 50mg total per day



Day 7:

Keep kratom steady (6-7 grams per dose)

Final Oxy day. aim for 20–30mg max, then you're done with Oxy.


Heads up: That first full day with no Oxy will suck.But the kratom takes enough of the edge off to get through it without losing your shit.


If within your budget also buy : 

Rhodiola Rosea : once daily, helps with low mood and depression-like feelings

L-Tyrosine : 500–1000 mg per day, supports dopamine recovery

Magnesium Bisglycinate :  reduces muscle aches and nerve tension

Omega-3 DHA-rich fish oil : promotes brain recovery

Lion’s Mane : boosts neuroplasticity and mental clarity



When you made it to day 7, let me know and I'll tell you what I would do the weeks after that. Best of luck man, I was on 400mg oxy and made it as well!",2,t1_n1o24op

Feeling sad and scared, any support appreciated 💜",[deleted],"I have a suggestion if you are worried about being on subs long term. Ask your provider about Sublocade. Once they stabalize you on subs (my provider only requires one week), then they switch you to the sublocade injection. It's recommended that you do 3 monthly injections, and then you stop. The bupe slow releases in your system until it's gone. This gives your body time to adjust and I'm certain your brain is slowly adjusting and healing as well. I did 3 injections. I came off with pretty much no physical withdrawal. I was clean for 5 months after that. Unfortunately, I relapsed. However, it wasn't due to withdrawal. It was stress induced because I didn't change much while I was on bupe. Sublocade is a great option for people who don't want to be chained to MAT for years.",8,t3_1iy2ht0

5789,m58qrxz,1hsvodh,"22 says sober, does anyone else get extremely self conscious and bad depersonalization when they quit ",saulmcgill3556,"Some of the emotions and thoughts you’re describing are relatable to me. I distinctly remember when I used to be in withdrawal (or when I was in early recovery) feeling like I couldn’t look people in the eye. Like my vision was off and I felt like I looked so weird, I just couldn’t meet eye contact. 

When I was using, I *never* ran out — I mean extremely, extremely rarely. Because once I was in WD, I was basically incapable of helping myself. I can remember going to work once and feeling like my players were looking at a completely different person. I can’t say how much of that was reality, but that’s how it felt. Like every nerve in my body was set on edge.

I’m not going too deep on the neurobiological basis of this (it’s something I’ve written on many times before). But the discontinuation of opioids *annihilates* our self esteem. Our body (which includes the brain) has become conditioned for one exogenous source to provide our most basic, fundamental human needs — like safety and security. So our brain is operating from a basic survival mode (limbic system); not a place suited to function “normally” and interact with other people — or even interact with ourselves and our own thoughts, subsequent emotions. This is just one way in which withdrawal can produce feelings of detachment or depersonalization.

When I decided to “get clean” my experience with withdrawal was quite different — for a number of reasons. Are you quitting right now by your own volition? Or is this one of those situations you mentioned like when you just “run out?” 

I need to run, but your post evokes many thoughts for me. You’re not alone, and I really hope this is just the beginning of a story that leads to you having that safety, security and esteem without opioids (if that’s what you want). Wishing you the best, and I’ll answer any questions or help in any way I can.",10,t3_1hsvodh

You've described your mental / emotional state really well, and yes - I definitely have experienced that headspace. Benzo withdrawal causes worse depersonalization for me than opioid withdrawal, but for some reason, the longer half-life opioids (methadone and buprenorphine) cause significant depersonalization during withdrawal for me, as well. 

Two tools that really helped me are (1) journaling, and (2) mindfulness meditation / guided relaxation exercises / and cognitive re-framing techniques from CBT and DBT.

If you're interested, I've compiled [75 prompts](https://www.concreteconfessionalblog.com/post/75-dynamic-writing-prompts-for-addiction-recovery-journaling) about addiction / recovery, spirituality, self-growth, and other positive topics for people who, like me, benefit from journaling. There are some fun and creative ideas thrown in there, too.

I also wrote a guide to CBT, DBT, psychodynamic therapy, and Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy [here](https://www.concreteconfessionalblog.com/post/cbt-dbt-rebt-emdr-untangling-the-therapy-alphabet-four-questions-to-answer-before-you-book-you); I provided a guide consisting of four questions to ask yourself to help determine which therapeutic approach will best suit your needs. 

In addition, I highly recommend hydrating, a multivitamin, and exercising to whatever capacity your body is able to right now. Light, stretching- and breathing-based exercise such as hatha yoga will do wonders for allowing you to inhabit your body more comfortably. 

All the best! Let us know how things are progressing. What a wonderful thing you're doing for yourself for the new year.

I think that's also when the body shaming to myself started. because at least the physical part of me i could alter to my liking, control the outcome, can't change your face. now that i am finally sober, i feel like that young teen, unsure what she sees, what she wants to see, for herself and who she wants to show the world she is.  and the insecurities, introduced me to diet pills, that's really where my addiction started.

I’ve been an addict to different forms before. I’m really interested in the neurobiological basis of the way opioids, or even more specifically drugs, affect the human mind. My biggest dream has always been to go to school and study recreational psychopharmacology, but I made bad choices as a kid (clearly lol) and can’t afford it. I’ve been trying to make a connection between GABA receptors and self esteem, and how they regulate thoughts and self image. I’m guessing that since there’s some kind of regulation problem between addicted and stopping opioids, my GABA and dopamine production and reception is fried, as well as opioids heavily affecting the frontal lobe of brain function, and myself specifically having a disorder that inhibits growth/function of my frontal lobe.

(Hahaha.) I never received any college credit; I guess i assumed I was auditing some kind of top secret certificate or minor because this fieldwork didn't appear on my transcripts at all and my thesis advisor never brought it up either. As an undergrad maybe I was not the most with it and should not in retrospect made assumptions! 

Overall my introduction to the field via these unpaid internships was totally unsatisfactory. I was expecting a special cord to wear with my graduation gown to reflect my participation in the recreational drug use internship program, but alas - perhaps in my enthusiasm for the internships themselves I neglected to contact the correct administrators to get such a thing. My bad! 

Moreover I feel like my participation in at least a couple of these internships is still ongoing despite my having matriculated like, 20 years ago! I guess I never got any official communication telling me it was time to stop, and the cohort was so badly organized with minimal leadership and a good number of students transferred or dropped out rather early on so maybe I got lost in the shuffle.

Therefore I am honestly so very confused. (Mainly about why I didn't choose a college with a stronger recreational drug use program.) As a first generation participant in this program (at the undergraduate level anyways) I wish I could have gotten some kind of honors at graduation, or guidance on how to make my fieldwork relevant to an actual academic field, or something useful in terms of mentorship from a professor or something. The school could have at least reimbursed me for the drugs since the internship itself was going to be unpaid! The data I have gathered is all qualitative and mostly not written down and not really data as such but still I'm sure I have been participating for like 20 years longer than I should have and have generated something useful that should be remunerated!

This whole thing is clearly a disturbing example of way in which higher education is a grift designed to suck money from the permanent underclass. I spent so much money buying supplies for these unpaid drug use internships over the years. Anyway perhaps if you get into higher ed and find a good program that does not take advantage of unpaid student workers - if you would like access to my field notes you're more than welcome!

It can include hobbies, exercise, getting involved in things like meetings and something spiritual, but you’ve gotta fill that gap if you wanted to get easier, sooner. And it’s not always gonna be easy, especially an early recovery, but you’ve gotta build that muscle.  If you’re not going to meetings, I would recommend you start.  If you are going, then I would get more involved than you are now you definitely should be exercising. It does wonders for the brain and body, and makes the journey a lot easier.

It will only get worse. In your mind you think you are OK because “at least I’m not on fentanyl”. 

People don’t go strait to fentanyl. It’s a slow slope, multi year process. 

Stop now and have a good life or prepare you mind for the worst. 

Here’s what I posted: 

It could be so much worse for you. So many people are addicted to fentanyl. It’s powerful and cheap.

I remember when I first came clean to my family and Drs that I was an addict. I was taking 7-8 Norco 10’s a day and I was so ashamed.

My Dr told me to go to rehab immediately. I thought that I was “too good” for rehab. I had a negative image of seeking help. I also was afraid that if I took time off of my job, it would ruin my career.

So I started with suboxone. But then I would stop taking suboxone. Feel great for a couple of weeks. And then start to get cravings.

My story is bad. I’ve relapsed probably 100 times. Well past the fentanyl stage.

I’ve been clean for 7 years. But I feel like I lost a decade of my life.

I keep going back to one point in time in my mind. The night I first came clean to my wife (now ex-wife) that I was an addict and we went to go see my dr that day.

When he told me to go to rehab immediately. The overwhelming shame I felt, combined with the thought that I could push through it myself.

My life would be so different today. If I had just gone to rehab that night. Back when 8 Norcos was enough.

I did end up going to rehab a few years later. It was amazing. It was like going to a luxury spa. And work didn’t care, I got to use FMLA.

I wish it didn’t take me 4 years of struggle to get to rehab. I wish I had the strength in the beginning of my journey.

Rehab wasn’t even the end of my addiction. I went much deeper in the years after.

What saved me was sublocade. The shot you get once a month. Doing that for a year and getting on suboxone. Then slowly tapering.

If you have a job that had health benefits, please go to rehab.

Don’t be like me and thousands of others who wait until everything is gone.

Come clean to your dad. Go to rehab. Get on suboxone. Stop listening to people who say suboxone is harder to get off of than drugs. It’s not. Also who decided you need to get off suboxone right away anyways. Stay on it for a year or two until your brain has a sense of a normal routine again.

I hope you read my note. You have a family that will support you. Don’t wait until you’ve lost them too. Drug addiction takes away everything, in time.",2,t3_1owwgty

I'm 22 years old, and i knew that coming out of treatment i wanted to stay clean of opiates, but I'm not ready to go fully abstinent. I couldn't white-knuckle the opiates, and i wasn't working a programme. Now this definitely is not the easy way out, but i decided to go on a low dose of methadone (20mg) since my last relapse, as i knew if I didn't do that or go into treatment again, there was no chance of me staying off the oxy. Methadone has helped so much with the cravings and the mental obsession. I would say, if you're white-knuckling day after day and not working a programme, you're inevitably going to keep relapsing, from my experience. I had to be honest with myself; i was not willing to work a programme, plus I didn't want to go completely sober from everything. So i decided to go on methadone, as it seemed like the safest thing to do. Now it's at least giving me time to work through some of the shit with a therapist without constantly relapsing.

I hated my life on fetty and at the end of my active addiction it was no longer a slow death by substance abuse but a rapid one. I don't think about using hardly at all but if I was clean off of something I actually liked that might be different. I got into NA and that's what saved my life. I detoxed at home before someone suggested I go to a meeting but if it wasn't for the program I'd have never stayed clean this long. The problem is that the drugs aren't the actual problem. For addicts the drugs are the solution. They are our coping mechanism for life, for pain (physical/mental/emotional), and for just wanting to feel good. If you cut out the drugs but don't work on the underlying issues recovery has a very small chance of sticking around. That's where the phrase ""white knuckling"" comes from.  You need support. The benefits of an addict helping another are invaluable. In a program you will find people who know exactly what you're going thru and have a proven method for staying clean. It's not easy but it's simplified where you're just following in the footsteps of those before you. Check out a program. NA saved my ass when I tried everything before. MAT didn't work for me. Religion, psychiatry, and therapy weren't enough for me. 12 step program is what is working for me. Best of luck. Hit me up anytime",1,t3_1owwgty

It's interesting because I remember in the early days of my internet usage as well - the harm reduction / de-evil-izing opiates tended to morph into a positive sentiment about opiates in a lot of the blogs going around. Even places like Erowid felt that way. I dunno I think there were a lot of people drinking the koolaid and it might have contributed to the opiate crisis. 

I'll tell you what though, what eventually helped me as well was when heroin no longer became heroin, what was even worse was when fent no longer was fent lol. Made it so easy to quit haha.

I spent 2 years straight on it and accepted that I would be like that until I died, and accepted everyday could be my last and I probably wouldnt even have a clue when it happen. 


Heroin and painkillers were definitely insidious, but I realized finally with fentynal how insane opiate addiction really is no matter the strength or frequency, I couldn't ignore it anymore and I was forced to confront the root issues of why I was even doing this to myself or die pretty much.


There was no in between anymore and ironically I had built a stable life for myself while on fentynal, literally from homelessness (usually these stories go the opposite way) so id look at my life and think


""i should be happy, why am I not?""


""I have a great life and all the fentynal I could ever need, whats the catch?"" 


And thats when I spent long drives talking to myself, thinking out loud, feeling waves of emotions from nothing, and so I was forced to either do more and risk ODing to numb that, or feel those suppressed emotions and think those denied thoughts.


Thats when it all became so clearly stupid to me, and I finally worked my way off of it.


In the most unexpected way possible I thank fentynal for being such a nightmare that it killed my urge for opiates and really all drugs and alcohol period. 


When I go to NA meetings, and people with years sober talk about having urges i feel awkward almost because I can't relate, and almost take pity that they are still having urges.

and its not even the physical withdrawals, if you can get through that (hard enough) literally like 10 days clean youre still mentally fried..

there's a background anxiety and depression which causes like 90% of people to relapse within the first 6 weeks its very sneaky and powerful

If you’re on short acting opiates you should really be able to get rid of 70 - 80% of your withdrawal symptoms with this… But I’ll break it down as follows:

- Sweats/Anxiety
I use the medication propranolol for this, although you could substitute it out for metoprolol, but I prefer propranolol because it hits more receptors. 40mg twice per day is usually sufficient, but it can be bumped up to 80mg if needed. If you’re on it for longer than a week or two you’re going to want to taper this down 1/4 of a tablet every few days because you’ll experience some rebound anxiety afterwards… you’ll likely need a prescription for this. You can use clonidine, but I don’t find it’s as effective as propranolol, but I take clonidine at night to help with sleep.

- Stomach aches and diarrhea
I use Buscopan (hyoscine butylbromide), just use it as directed, usually 2 tablets 4 times per day. This greatly reduces your stomach aches. I use Imodium (loperamide) for the diarrhea. Again just use as instructed, or maybe **slightly** higher, I start with 4 tablets as opposed to the suggested 2, and then add 2 tablets for every subsequent watery stool (don’t fall into the trap of taking ultra high doses)

- Nausea/Vomiting
You can use Maxolon (metoclopramide) and/or Stemetil (prochlorperazine) depending on the severity of your nausea. You can also use Zofran (ondansetron) wafers.

- Insomnia
If you can trust yourself, then a week’s worth of Ambien (zolpidem) or Valium (diazepam). Be honest with yourself though, if you think there’s any chance you’d abuse them then don’t go down that route. Alternatively you can use Dayvigo (lemborexant) as this is a lot less likely to be abused and/or habit forming. You can also use short term Phenergan (promethazine).

Also another thing to keep in mind is keeping yourself hydrated, also added electrolytes wouldn’t hurt. I also found that magnesium supplements at bed time help with sleep almost as good as prescription medications (either glycinate, threonate or citrate forms are the best, just avoid magnesium oxide, it’s cheap but it’s got a very low bioavailability so hardly any of it gets absorbed)

With this combination you should be able to push through the worst of the withdrawals (for short term opiates that’s usually the first 48 - 72 hrs) or long term opiates like methadone or suboxone it could be a week or two. It should at least lessen quite a substantial amount of the difficulties with it at least… I haven’t tried it coming off fent but it helped me kick a ~300mg-400mg per day oxy habit… it wasn’t completely painless but it was certainly better than no comfort meds at all.

There are other helpful medications like Lyrica (pregabalin) or gabapentin, and as mentioned earlier benzos. I wouldn’t recommend the first two as they’re arguably harder to come off than opiates. But benzos can be helpful if you only get a small (one week supply) but if you think there’s any chance you’ll abuse them then steer clear of them…

Also, one of the questions you have to ask yourself is that if you make withdrawal painless, are you more likely to relapse? If you are 100% dedicated to quitting but just can’t handle the withdrawal symptoms then this might help. But if you’re a constant relapser then maybe a painful withdrawal will help sear it in your memory to help you avoid relapsing in the future.",3,t3_1m9m69l

This drug is a Toll Like Receptor 4 (TLR4) antagonist, meaning it'll suppress the inflammatory response caused by morphine-3-glucuronide.

It's the build up of M3G that triggers TLR4 thus producing cytokines that build up and up and up. The good stuff in the opiates ie M6G blocks you from feeling the cytokines. 

Until that is you run out of morphine/heroin, (pretty much most opiates / opioid). That's wben you feel the full force of the cytokine storm.

It's not withdrawals, it's actually an oxymoron to call it that. It's more a side effect of opiates.

5932,n58p8qv,1m9m69l,Can opiate withdrawal be bypassed completely..?,[deleted],"Yes, definitely, in fact, under certain conditions, one could get through the wd like a mild flu. However, zero disturbance? Wishful thinking... The following are some pointers that worked for me and whom I have observed around me.

1) If using H and have access to weaker forms of opioids, switching to them and tapering will help you reduce the damage to begin with. H is by far the worst opioid to withdraw from, it hurts like hell. (I don t have experience with fent or xylazines) For me the best alternative was raw opium. The withdrawal is a cakewalk compared to H.

  
2) Some comfort meds are fantastic. I won't say Suboxone, which I think is a really rotten way to withdraw but if you need to work throughout the ordeal, cannot stay at home for any reason, Buprenorphine, or Methadone works. Tapering from them? Good luck though, Bupe is long and arduous, though weaker in hurt, and methadone is an altogether different beast.

Valium and benzos go without saying but Pregabaline is a lifesaver that I am sad to not have had access before. It doesn't eradicate the pain, but damn if it doesn't make it very very manageable. However, you are still ill for five days, just not very ill... 600-1200 mgs will make your week long ordeal a semi-conscious haze of mild drunkenness and stupor. However be careful with pregabaline too, apparently its tolerance peak and withdrawal are no joke either.

  
3) Another incredible find I had to discover for myself is that, quitting Methamphetamine and Heroin at the same time, actually make both ordeals easier! I don't have an explanation for this, I'm not sure if this works for everyone either, but I swear I got into this situation by accident and was expecting hell to pay; turned out I was sleeping all through the first 3 days, and by the time I sort of came back to life with meth, I noticed that 5 days had passed and I had just forgotten that I should'Ve had withdrawal pain from heroin too... I really am curious to know if anyone else experienced this?

4) Unless you're fixing to get clean off everything you use, I find that at the 4th days ' night of opioid wd, a bit of a frolic with a dopamine reuptake inhibitor like coke, crack, meth, actually finishes your opioid illness a bit earlier, with an added bonus of a antidepressant jolt of euphoria and stimulation. Especially crack worked wonders unfortunately, I felt so high that all else was forgotten. The next day I woke up and again had forgotten the opioid thing and felt like I had my life back. Any Paws stemming from an ongoing grogginess, fatigue and lack of motivation were out of the question. I don't mean to say go on with crack as of that day though, I mean only the 4th night for some medication purposes and then onwards with your treatment. It probably will work the opposite way after some time if you stick to another hard drug to stave off one wd. But one dose? Yes, it may work wonders.

  
5) Ibogaine is a goddamn miracle too! But it is no walk in the park and I can understand if even the worst needle junkie will say no to an ibogaine treatment. I enjoyed it because I love being hit by a psychedelic truck, high dosage lsd etc are not things I run to, but if I am taking it, I am not going to go half a tab or anything. So, an ideal Ibogaine HCL treatment lasts 3 full days of staying in a bed, unable to sit up, go to the bathroom alone, or even sleep soundly. The first day is a roller coaster of hallucinations, madness and healing of proportions that make an ayahuasca ceremony seem like a kindergarten recess. But by the end of the 3 days, when you wake up, you could have forgotten being an addict previously, you can quit anything through Ibogaine if you like, cigarettes etc as well, as long as you stay off it, relapses are very possible, not because of cravings, but because the way an addict' brain will jump to say ""oh well, I got through with this, I can do it again no worries. A tiny relapse won't hurt, besides, I deserve it"" (!) You probably know the score.",1,t3_1m9m69l
5933,n58r0k7,1m9m69l,Can opiate withdrawal be bypassed completely..?,gluegunfun,"before Street fentanyl became overwhelming I would say detox and rehab have a pretty solid protocol.  Just the discomfort of getting to the 24 hour mark over, however, as long as you need before starting subs. Do a short sub, taper, around a week or so, supplement with drugs, like clonidine and other typical detox drugs.  Results would vary from completely painless to mild discomfort. Every once in a while, you get a patient that had a rougher go of it but that was usually because they had a really bad habit for a really long time.  Especially people coming off of painkillers like oxy and Hydro seem to have the easiest time of all.

Now with all the Street fentanyl Suboxone route is very problematic. Some people find success with the Bernice method, a.k.a. micro induction and treating.

I personally am curious about nothing else potential for being a Detox only medication, using it for about a week give or take.  methadone user as well swear up and down that that’s a recipe for disaster but if someone is able to get on and only take it for a limit to the time, I think we should try it.",1,t3_1m9m69l

Buprenorphine is considered the gold standard medication for opioid use disorder and is widely used to help people taper off pain medications or illicit opioids. However, many individuals who have used various opioids will argue that withdrawal from buprenorphine can feel more prolonged or difficult compared to short-acting opioids like oxycodone, morphine, or hydrocodone. This is largely due to buprenorphine’s long half-life, which means its withdrawal phase can be drawn out, even if the intensity is often lower.

If you want to be entirely free from opioids, you will eventually need to discontinue buprenorphine as well, which involves facing withdrawal. Some consider being on buprenorphine as being “clean.” However, it is still an opioid.

There are numerous methods for tapering off opioids, but all involve some level of withdrawal symptoms.

Titration, has traditionally been the most common method of discontinuing opioids. However, achieving precise dose reductions with conventional tablets or capsules can be challenging. Compounding pharmacies can assist with this process by preparing medications in exact, smaller increments, for example, doses within the 0.1 mg range rather than simply halving or quartering a pill. Still, at some point, the dose becomes low enough that you must stop completely. Even with micro-tapering, withdrawal symptoms are often unavoidable. Most doctors will not commit to years-long tapers where doses are reduced by such small increments, which means some discomfort is almost inevitable. Plus most insurance policies won't cover this. 

There are medications that can help manage withdrawal symptoms, such as clonidine (to reduce anxiety, agitation, and some physical symptoms), loperamide (for diarrhea), ondansetron (for nausea), hydroxyzine (for anxiety and sleep), NSAIDs (for muscle aches), and gabapentin or pregabalin (sometimes used off-label for nerve pain and sleep). These do not eliminate withdrawal, but they can make it more tolerable. Some Doctor's may prescribe z-drugs or benzodiazepines to help with the sleep/anxiety. Though due to the addiction potential and benzo potential being worse than opiate withdrawal. Potentially swapping one addicctio for another, a lot Doctors won't risk ir  

Then there is the psychological side of withdrawal. Physical withdrawal is unpleasant because your body is rebalancing its neurochemistry after prolonged opioid use. However, many people struggle just as much with the mental aspect. Opiates often provide a sense of euphoria or relief that fills a void, whether emotional, psychological, or both. This “emptiness” and the loss of that comfort can make staying off opioids incredibly difficult, even after the physical symptoms fade.

Feeling a sense of dysphoria, lack of energy, lack of enjoyment in things you'd usually enjoy are pretty common and can take months to subside.",1,t3_1m9m69l

6104,mx0h184,1l7nvtx,Being accused of using when you didn’t use hurts so bad?,annikatidd,"Sorry in advance for my essay, oops. I left a TL;DR below. (1/2)

Dude for real. It’s so upsetting, I had family members who would get mad at me and instead of just talking about the actual issue, they would accuse me of using even though every time I could pass a drug test instantly. Then “I must have faked it somehow” and it got really bad when I had an entire group of my “family”, most of whom I never even did anything to while using constantly calling the cops or even DCYF or going as far as threatening to call the judge in my case lmao (I got sober before my kid was born and worked my ass off every day since to prove I would stay clean) it was so awful and toxic. Had to realize that’s not in my control and ultimately cut a lot of people out of my life, I’m so much better for it. Seems like they think if you’re in recovery and god forbid you have emotions in a conflict, you must be high. Like what? I’m *no longer* numbing my emotions with drugs and I’m allowed to be upset especially if I’m being treated like shit lol. The accusations definitely hurt more and more each time too. 

I tried to make amends even though I didn’t follow a 12 step so i apologized to everyone who is important to me but ofc you can’t make anyone accept that, and you can’t force anyone to believe you’re doing well. and I know it’s the aftermath of doing shitty things in the past but hopefully if they’re really worth it they will come around and accept you as you are now, a sober individual just trying to get through life as best you can! 

I have an alcoholic sister (and other family members) who get praised because “alcohol is legal, it’s normal” honey it’s not normal to drink and drive or black out for five days on end. Years ago, I said I was worried about her and she tried to punch me and say “at least it’s not heroin!” like ??? ok well I’m just saying I’m worried about your excessive drinking. That turned into her and my aunt getting super drunk (while my sister was underage may I add) taking my sleeping child out of her bed in the middle of the night - she was like 2.5yo at the time. They were refusing to give her back to me, my aunt then assaulted my husband and tried to choke him out while stumbling around with our kid at the top of the stairs and almost smashed her into the wall. So I was terrified because it was so random and scary, especially from people I thought I could trust. but then to make it worse my sister and aunt called the cops on ME which is wild since my aunt gave my minor sister alcohol, I was just begging them to give my kid back to me. then they tried to drink and drive away with my kid in the car. I had to threaten the cops to get them to stop them, saying “if anything happens to my kid because of them, I will hold this police department accountable and go after all of you” then the cops finally did something and ofc they refused a breathalyzer lmao. This was only one horrible thing that happened after I got clean with “family” i used to trust. I spent every waking moment either tending to her needs, working several outpatient programs, doing all the meetings, parenting classes, therapy, drug tests etc I had to do but it was never enough for some of them, so staying away from them helps.

The whole incident really destroyed my relationship with my sister forever but I try my best to tolerate her now that she has my nephew who I adore and nephew no 2 on the way. But it’s not the same, and my aunt is dead to me. Everyone else who did horrible things to me when I was fighting every day to stay clean and hadn’t done shit to them is dead to me. It’s like no, I’m not wrong for protecting my peace from alcoholics who don’t realize they have an issue just as bad as mine was, maybe worse since I never got violent like they do. That’s when I learned that in my recovery at least, I have to pick and choose who I let in because not everyone has your best interests in mind, even people you used to be super close with or look up to. 

It’s just weird how they think because I’m the junkie and they “just drink normally” (lol) then they’re automatically better than me, nobody’s addiction is better ffs. It sucks but it can’t be changed. I’ll probably cut off my sister forever once our kids are grown, because she never once said sorry and she’s become a very heartless person, I don’t even recognize her anymore. It’s so sad. Like this is what I get for worrying about your drinking issue considering I’ve seen how brutal and dangerous alcohol wds can be from detoxing with them in rehab? A drunk attempted child abduction? Ugh. If it was HER kid and I did this, I guarantee I’d have been arrested. everyone would’ve hated me but nope somehow I was still in the wrong for trying to protect my child 😒 

Oh and what really pisses me off is when it’s someone who didn’t even know you from that time. I’ve been clean almost 7 years but I had a really shitty last couple of weeks. My dog passed away which crushed me, had him for 11 years since I was 15 and he got me through all my trauma and suffering, including my addiction. This along some other crap that also happened recently, I just haven’t been doing well mentally but that doesn’t mean I’m not going backwards, and I’ll still be polite at work and do my job. Just not my usual self. Anyway, yesterday my boss was showing me some unrealistic sales goals I guess I’m supposed to hit so I was looking at the paper and she was like “are you okay?” And I said “yeah? I’m fine” and then she goes “well you just look a little OFF” side eyeing me and looking at me like I had two heads. she knows I’m in recovery so it seemed she was insinuating that I was high or something. Comments like that bother me to no end, it had me paranoid I looked fucked up but like .. I didn’t. I looked sad. With all the shit that I just dealt with, I’m SO sorry I’m not my usual happy self but that doesn’t mean anything. Like wtf, I’m not on drugs if that’s what you’re getting at. I’m depressed but I’m still working doing my best here. She wasn’t the only one who made rude comments about my face yesterday too. I’m like wtf the only difference was how I wasn’t wearing blush and mascara like every other day so I was like … cool. This is the exact reason I had bad self esteem issues for so long and wouldn’t leave the house for over a decade without wearing tons of makeup, I always got told I look high or tired or sick. thanks it’s just my face!!!",3,t3_1l7nvtx

But I know keeping calm is likely better in that situation. It is what it is, I guess. As long as YOU know the truth and the most important people to you know the truth, even if they want to say rude crap about you possibly using when they know you didn’t then screw everyone else. But definitely don’t put up with any toxicity longer than you have to, trust me!! If I had just pulled away from certain people years ago who were exhibiting toxic behavior and using my addiction as some sort of attack, an attempt to shame me, I probably could’ve saved myself a hell of a lot of pain and bullshit. Maybe even saved some of the relationships that are now destroyed. Too late now. 

So fucking annoying. Anyway, sorry for venting on your post. Know I totally have been there and I bet most of us have!

Can we not talk about my addiction just for one day? It’s been years bro. Like I literally had to make recovery my entire personality (which I would’ve rather have not done, I would’ve rather just kept it to myself since it’s so personal instead of feeling the pressure to be this open about it with everyone in my life but oh well), but if I didn’t do that, then everyone was constantly acting like I was high every other day. It sucks when it’s people you love who want to use it against you to guilt trip you for the past, I may feel guilty about some things but I don’t feel ashamed for being an addict, especially am not ashamed for getting myself out of that hellish life. I can’t take back what I did but I can show you I’m not going to go back. but if you can’t realize that then it’s not my problem! 

TL;DR 

But yeah, ofc I don’t know your relationships but, just putting it out there - I’d definitely keep an eye on the situation with them, if it gets any worse consider putting some distance there because that type of crap is not beneficial to you as someone who has to fight for your life every day no matter how long you’ve been clean in order to maintain your recovery. Anyone who may want to drag you down mentally shouldn’t get to be near you! Just my two cents. If you keep finding yourself in scenarios where you’re once again having to prove you’re sober instead of just getting to enjoy life, my advice would be to reconsider how much time you spend around that type of person. At some point enough is enough, they can believe us or don’t. it’s not our problem, you know?",3,t1_mx0h184

6118,mx0tjmm,1l7nvtx,Being accused of using when you didn’t use hurts so bad?,problyurdad_,"I look at it similarly to how partners sometimes accuse you of cheating. Usually it’s unhealthy relationships that you see that in, however, your first reaction is to panic.    
    
But you could always use humor - “I am not cheating on you, I wish I was studly enough to have the mental and physical fortitude to have as much sex as you think I am but I assure you I am doing just fine keeping up with you.”     
     
A similar approach in addiction would be - “I understand you’re seeing some signs and things, and that’s on me. However, I assure you that day in and out I am working hard on, and committed to my sobriety, well being, and mental health. I can’t prove that I’m not using but I can choose to ignore the sentiment and recognize that you’re probably upset right now. When you’re ready to talk I will be here, still clean, and striving to be the best version of myself that I can be, so that instances like these can one day be completely behind me.

I wish this person nothing but the best in life, they mean a lot to me, but ouch did it sting this time around.  Cravings are gone now!!

I weend down on fentynal over the course of 6 weeks but couldnt go a day without at least a tiny bump like barely enough to even see, and I just couldnt do it hence the methadone.


It was a low dose though, never went over 10mg. Then I bought DLPA. That gave me the ambition to get off methadone slowly. I got a bunch of supplements. Some I still take.


Zinc, Vit D3 in the morning, Magnesium at night


I also started taking probiotics about a month ago. 




Im about 5 months clean but im still making progress and lapsing into PAWS symptoms even now. Like crazy ass chills sometimes.


It kinda goes on a cycle at this point. I'll be feeling upbeat for like 7-10 days, then ill start getting less energy for about 2-3 days until it drops and I have barely any motivation or pleasure, then that continues anywhere from 2-5 days, sometimes longer sometimes its just for an afternoon. Its very unpredictable but I had to learn to accept that shit, because ultimately its my brain and hormones trying to recalibrate.


I picture it like I hired a bunch of temps for my brain and body and let the main workers go on vacation. Then I fired all the temps lol. So after a long vacation, my main guys came back to a shitshow left by temps who had no clue how to run the show. My main dudes are now scrambling to get the show back to normal but they were just on vacation for 2 years straight and are stressed tf out at the mess left behind, plus now they gotta find their momentum again after 2 years off the job.


Long story short, im gonna feel weird sometimes, best thing I can do is ride it out and get used to it, and not get mad at my own body since im the one that let a bunch of under qualified temps wreck the place lol. And when I feel good and like myself, just validate that to my self and really let myself feel the difference and see that ultimately that is what normal feels like, so even when I dont feel normal, at least I can check my memory bank and see theres clearly money in there.

Then I got locked up and made a commitment to myself that I wouldn’t use for the length of my sentence (3 years) even the parole/probation part. Believe me, I struggled. But, what worked for me (maybe not for everyone) was literally telling myself that if I stayed clean for those 3 years and still felt like I wanted to use, I could do that. In the day to day when it was bad, I’d tell myself that I could use tomorrow if I felt the same. I put together about 13 years and relapsed after hurting my back. But even then, I used for maybe 6 months and now I’ve been clean 11 or so years. 

You said you know what will happen if you use. Keep thinking it through all the way to the end. I used to do that too. I definitely didn’t want to go back to where I was. I also went to meetings. Not for everyone, I know, but building relationships helped me a lot. I’m a Social Worker now and have worked in homelessness for years. Being housed is not something you want to screw up these days. I don’t know where you live, but I’m in Melbourne Australia (moved from America like 12 years ago. There’s NO HOUSING as in people wait for 10-30 years no lie. I don’t think the US is any better.

It’s normal from the drugs and how they are effecting the brain, all of our brains. Downregulation of dopamine receptors, our MU opioid receptors, signalling is deregulated, stimuli we normally feel good over doesn’t feel great suddenly, because the brain has rewired and adjusted to feeling pleasure from the drugs, and ONLY the drug. It’s perfectly normal early on. Don’t fight it, don’t think “I SHOULD BE HAPPY” that’ll frustrate you even more. Validate yourself, it’s ok, and it’s only normal I feel this way right now because of the drug, any normal doctor with a brain cell will tell you it’s normal; perfectly normal from how the brain changes after opioid use. It will go away and adjust over time back to normal.",5,t3_1lg03ej
6187,mytr720,1lg03ej,Head full of evil thoughts,[deleted],"As a couple people mentioned, the dopamine crash is a huge part of feeling dissatisfied or discontent right now. Your brain's natural dopamine production has been totally compromised by the drugs. Getting to a stable dose is super important. Also, I highly recommend supplementing your vitamin D and magnesium, both of which can be depleted by methadone. No one told me that, and I had severe deficiency for years, which can affect your mood, and for me, damaged my teeth. Also, magnesium will help calm you and help you feel less rattled. It's also important to stay occupied to combat the preoccupation with the drug. When I'm idle, it's way too easy for me to give in to self-destructive thoughts and behaviors, which was especially true of the early days. It's crucial to get to a stable dose and allow your brain to readjust. It takes time, but time flies. It's been 6 years for me. Before that, it was nearly 13 years of total abstinence before a neck/back injury and 7 herniated/bulging discs led me to prescription opioid dependency. Some of those early days may seem to crawl by as you're forced to take it minute-by-minute, but ultimately, time flies. I hate that I wasted several years in a relapse, accomplishing nothing but traumatizing myself in the vicious cycle of using. I sometimes miss the high, but it's just not worth it.",3,t3_1lg03ej

6191,myv5fhm,1lg03ej,Head full of evil thoughts,DefiedGravity10,"You dealt with the physical but you havent worked through the mental part of withdrawal. I went to a counselor and did some groups in out patient, a lot of people go to NA/AA/smart recovery and work the steps, therapy is an option too but any way you go you need to figure out why you started using, process any traumas from before or during use, identify your triggers (bored was my big one too), and figure out some healthier coping skills to use instead of drugs if those triggers happen.

I used on and off for a long time and I always heard people say you need support, you need to go to meetings, you cant do it alone.... well I was CERTAIN I was fine doing it alone. I used alone, detoxed alone, was sober alone, and then repeated that cycle over and over alone. When I finally asked for help and got into the counseling, when my friends and family knew the truth and that I wanted to get clean, and when I actually had a recovery support system is when I actually got sober and stayed sober.

First I had to get stable from the physical withdrawal, for me that was the brixadi shot but if methadone keeps you stable then that works too. Then I had to make sure I had people I could lean on who knew what I was going through and who could hold me accountable to those goals. I even told my best friend and dealer to never give me any because I was serious this time, and he never has. And then I had to do the work and process my shit so that every time I got bored or angry and upset I dont go straight to using. 

If you really want to get clean that is what I would recommend you do. I wasted a lot of my life trying to do it all by myself without letting people know i was struggling. There was no reason to do that except I wanted to keep using eventually, i didnt want to let people down so I kept it all secret, that was all my addiction. I am not saying it is easy or fun work but it is what broke the cycle for me and helped me stay sober longer than I thought I ever would. Good luck.",2,t3_1lg03ej

So the ability to be bored without feeling like I was being chased to go score or worry about scoring or worry about wd. 

But it’s not just the methadone it’s part of it, responsibility of groups and sessions with a counselor, which at first seemed useless, ended up being really important. At first it seemed like wth what is this gonna do. But all together it worked. Every milestone helped dosing only 3 times per week then two cause of take homes all helped. You know even the security gaurd was a help. I liked him a lot, he loved his job and it showed. He always gave me the scoop on what was going on. Sadly I didn’t see him a couple times, so I finally asked one of the nurses, “where is Kevin” she tells me he passed away. Still makes me feel bad. If I had known I would have talked to him longer the last time we talked. I still remember the conversation.

Any way the place I went was great they were very supportive, it was really helpful to have a good counselor. I had several, some were horrible and didn’t last there.

I am sat here. I have called my mom telling her I need 40£ for a TV so I can go and score. But I gotta wait an hour for a delivery first anyway. It seems I have no physical way of saying no. Rattling again yesterday has terrified me. I think it will take a while of smoking before I get a double habit on top of my methadone? But I am actually still scared of smoking today. I guess because in reality I know I will never stop. 

I like your thought process of telling yourself you could use tomorrow if needed. Something I found useful from my time in prison is actually a little different to you..   I find that telling myself the horrible end results of smoking does not scare me enough to stop. But I have to keep on telling myself over and over "" I have a house. I am not in prison. I can chill and make a cup of tea and eat what I want. I am not gonna be sick"" I find concentrating on the positives help.

I am in a new city so I know nobody here but I know where the smokers hang out. To be honest apart of me wishes I could just buy a weed and smoke a joint but then I would probably still crave more

Being dependent on both sucked and coming off of both sucked really bad.

I went cold turkey after nine years of opioid abuse, and I won’t lie, it was brutal. But I made it through. Not because I’m stronger or better, but because I reached the point where I knew I had to fight for my life. Just like you’re doing now—for yourself, and for your son.

You’ve already survived so much. Getting out of an abusive relationship and being there for your child, especially with his needs, shows how strong you truly are. Even if you don’t feel it right now.

Please don’t carry this alone. Even just talking about it, like you did here, is a massive first step. Whether you decide to taper or go cold turkey, just know: it’s possible to get through it. You’re not broken. You’re exhausted. And you deserve support, not shame.

If you're on 300mg of codeine a day or less, then it is quite sensible do 'taper' off - reduce your daily intake over a few weeks. But you'll probably need some outside support too. With all respect, Reddit might not be the best place to find that. Have a look at SMART Recovery.

My honest advice would be to come clean to your GP and ask for help with tapering, or go cold turkey and ask for comfort medication like gabapentin, clonidine, loperamide, naproxen/paracetamol and something to help with sleep when the RLS is unbearable. Is there anyone that can help you with your kid? You'll need it for around a week or so if you go the CT route. Cold turkey can be done but you'll need a ton of support and don't expect to feel like yourself for at least a month... Not trying to scare you, but just trying to be realistic as you have a child to think about (I was in the same boat and needed a TON of support during withdrawal). 

I'm 4 weeks in and physically feel recovered, but it's a mental struggle. I'd also recommend contacting your local D&A services for support, you shouldn't have to do this alone and they can offer things like therapy and alternative pain medication.

The first method is the quick 1-2 week sub taper.This method is commonly used at detox facilities and at home detox services.

The idea is you load up the first couple days on a higher dose and slowly titrate off over the two week period. You can use other comfort meds to help the final wean off. 

Second option is MAT using methadone or subs. Its an a great option for people who are chronic relapsers, or just in a situation where they aren't full ready to be off opiates. Methadone is only prescribed at clinics that make you go daily, while suboxone can be prescribed monthly.

Third option is to taper off the codeine itself. Just slowly reduce the dose over a few weeks period, and take a long weekend off of work and withdrawal over 4-5 days. If you jump at a low dose, the withdrawal isn't as bad.",2,t3_1l0v3o4

Their program helped me a lot. NA meetings can be very daunting. I used to hate going to NA meetings - came away feeling worse than when I got there!

Yeah, 'taper' is the very definition of easier said than done! The mega-dosing with vitamin C is fairly new to me, but has a lot of people on the web who have used it successfully. There's tons of stuff on a Google search for Vitamin C and opiate withdrawal. I wouldn't dismiss the idea of speaking to your GP about it - it is their prescription that's got you off down this road, after all. But I guess you would have to judge that based on how you feel you get on with them.

Community addiction services (NHS) vary a lot around the country - some local groups are very good. It will be difficult to tackle this on your own. Another option is just to stop altogether for around 5 days if you can manage that - after that time you will need a much more 'normal' dose to achieve the same effect - but of course you will likely end up increasing the dose and 'topping up' as before. If you could get to a point where you are only using your prescription that will at least be better for your health and your wallet! I you happen to be a healthcare professional of any kind, then Practitioner Health offer a really good, and free, service.

6241,mvgsukh,1l0v3o4,I'm really scared for cold turkey,YungGingee,Even just tapering down a little will help in the long run… get down to a dose where you don’t crave more and cabe in to those cravings… every bit helps,4,t1_mvgnxd4
6242,mvgtlks,1l0v3o4,I'm really scared for cold turkey,gabbygreek,"There's a lot going around at the moment illness wise. Is your child in nursery? Kids get a lot from nursery, and it usually hits the parents harder (at least it always has with us), so could be an in excuse wise. Opiate withdrawal mimics flu symptoms. I'd go with that - say you have some sort of flu virus and need some help... You're unwell, she doesn't need to know the exact reason why you're unwell. I know lying is shitty but the alternative is coming clean to everyone, and it's understandable why you can't do that. I haven't either.

Gabapentin will help with the nerve pain from withdrawal, clonidine will help with the hot and cold. Your nervous system will be going crazy and it helps to quieten stuff so you can get some sleep and function a little. I'd also recommend buscopan for stomach cramps.

Don't be embarrassed. You're a person who was in pain, and were given something to help with that pain... And you trusted the people that gave it to you. How could you know this was going to happen? No one decides to become an addict, it just happens slowly and without you realising... Then you wake up one day and you have 600mg a day habit.

GPs have seen it hundreds of times, codeine addiction is so common in the UK. Unless they're a complete bastard they're not going to just cut you off and have you suffer, and there will be support they can offer to help you through it, whether that's a tapering plan, medication etc.",3,t1_mvgnul5

6244,mvjy6bu,1l0v3o4,I'm really scared for cold turkey,FD3S_13B_REW,"I guess you was from the uk because you don't see anyone from the US getting hooked on codeine haha. If you're entitled to free prescriptions, then just call your local drugs center. To get the number, go to the www.talktofrank.co.uk and you enter your postcode to find your nearest centre. Call them and arrange interview. They will do the rest for you. Its all free. Id recommend going on a super low dose of methadone ~15mg a day or subutex or subbies/subs at ~4mg per day as the slang name goes. Subs are strong a.f and you don't need a lot, most of these drugs clinics wanna put you on 12mg, and that's way to high. The starting dose for most for methadone is 30mg/day, but codeine is weak, so 15mg will do.

The drugs clinic will arrange with your doctor and get you on the right path, offer councilling and mental health help if needed and other services, in fact your doctor most likely isn't authorised to write prescriptions for these type of drugs, it takes a specialist trained doctor, and your local drugs clinic will have their own doctors. Your doctor will most likely send you there anyway. You tell them who your doctor is, and they send your monthly prescription to your chemist of choice. I goto a place called CGL Atlantic, i started on codeine, tramadol and onto H, so ive been exaxrly where you are, and all sorts of people go there for all sorts of addictions, from gambling to whatever. 

The problem with taking your codeine is, it makes you feel a bit high and nice for a bit, and it's that part of your brain which keeps nagging at you to take more. Subs/m.done don't get you high, so the first time you take them, you will still feel like taking the codeine maybe, but you won't be in withdrawal, and at only 15mg m.done or 4mg subs, you can taper off them pain free within 6 months.",2,t1_mvgnul5

We went with no car (got dropped off but this person would not pick us up until the week was over because the whole point was to get clean) and almost didn’t bring any money either so we wouldn’t be able to get anything but at the last second I grabbed my debit card and brought it.

Within a few weeks I had my first withdrawal, then my second and my third etc. I was only with him for a few months and during the last week before I finally managed to escape him, it was Christmas Day 2017 and I was with him at my house with my mom, stepdad, two sisters. And this is one of the biggest regrets in my life, but my stepdad had given my sisters these $100 visa gift cards and ofc not me because my family knew I was using. My ex was pissed and kept telling me to go steal the gift cards. I was like no because obviously they’re going to catch us but he threatened to hurt me AND more importantly my sisters (so I was like oh fuck no, you’re not touching them. Hit me all you want but you aren’t hurting them - I know I should’ve just called the cops and gotten him the fuck out of my life but back then I wasn’t thinking straight at all) so I did it. I took the gift cards, and immediately they knew it was us. My sister and stepdad were outside my door as he was talking about it so ofc they heard him and I told him he makes me want to kill myself, so I got the cops called on me. They asked me if it was true what I said, and I said yes. So they took me to the ER and I was held on psych watch for 24 hours. That was a pretty bad withdrawal, definitely not the worst time but it was hell cause they couldn’t give me buprenorphine or anything. Though a nurse did sneak me some Ativan even though she said she wasn’t supposed to.

Anyway that night was brutal. I tried to escape, obviously the doors were locked lmao. My ex tried to show up, that didn’t work and I’m glad it didn’t because I’m sure I would’ve gotten my face kicked in if I had. And then I had this little TV which I had to ask for the remote for because there were John Cena’s fights playing loudly on repeat and it was driving me nuts. I just kept trying to sleep and waking up to him yelling and ever since then I fucking hate John Cena. I think I turned on some Real ID true crime show and finally slept and then I got discharged in the morning, where ofc my first stop was to get high. It was a nightmare. 

But probably not as bad as when I was in rehab the last time, 8 months pregnant and was detoxing waiting for my first sub dose. The staff there was usually really good but there was this one night nurse who came in to check on me, I said I was nauseous and she gave me what I THOUGHT was Zofran. Nope it was subutex and she gave it to me way too early, so I immediately started panicking and yelled at her because it was way too soon. Then ofc a few minutes later I went into full blown precip and it was absolute hell. I was so angry and scared something would happen to my baby but I’m thankful to report we both survived it and my daughter is in kindergarten this year. She’s the light of my life. She’s perfect and healthy and happy. And because of her I am never going back, so let’s hope that remains my final hellish detox.

Edit: I wanted to clarify I did NOT have a kid with my abuser, I actually met my now husband in rehab the very first time I went (about a week or so after I got traumatized by John Cena in the hospital) and he got me out of that horrible dangerous relationship, and he’s a great daddy to our baby girl. We still struggled on and off during my pregnancy but thankfully both got sober when I was pregnant and have about 6.5 years clean now (:",2,t3_1kdcz74

My plug for Heroin was this sloppy, fat, black dude (probably 6” 1’, 250-280) that use to drive around in a stolen Tahoe, but he never told me it was stolen. I just knew because he had to pop the hood and use a screwdriver to hit the starter and crank it.💀😆

He use to have me pull up at whatever cheap hotel he was either staying and sometimes having housekeeping kick him out cause he would stay past check out. Or he would be holding some white “junkies” hostage with dope & using their hotel room to crash at and trap out of. 

…But not me, I’m not “low” like that. I’m on a high horse and I’m going back to my suburban house in my 2017 Infiniti Q50. 😝. Until I gave up in life at that point from drug addiction, losing my job, dead broke. Then it got repoed.

Not before I take it to Downtown Birmingham to Gate City, Tallapoosa, and Greensprings (do your homework on Gate City 😱👹) very dangerous areas, especially a white, red head dude. Had expired tag, took my brothers little registration sticker or whatever off his car to put on mine. The color or each month changes.

Luckily, my mom has always been there for me and never put me out on the streets. She really didn’t know for the longest cause I kept it a secret because I thought I had it all under control and lowkey was having a ball. 

Yeah, I’m not addicted, but I feel you on the “addiction ain’t done with me” cause I still consume different things that can become habit forming. Nothing too crazy. I smoke weed, drink these Kava shots, and now been ordering 7-OH. I know 7-OH has people coming out and saying how the WD are like heroin WD, if not a little worse. It’s 10x stronger than morphine they say. Idk about that 🤷‍♂️.  It is some goooooood shit though 😊. 

I just know how tired I am from the loop of getting high, get addicted quick, and either WD or keep going which leads all back to the same place eventually. I knew I had to do something quick and I wasn’t just gonna throw my life away already and be homeless type shit. 


I dont count my sober days either. I know about how long and that’s good enough for me.  I honestly try to forget about it as much as possible, knowing I won’t forget the pain and damage though. Never did 12 steps, don’t even know what they all are. 

I’ve got a strong conscious (probably from the shrooms and LSD) and when I’m determined and done, I’m fucking done, son. 

I remember being with my old best friend and we stop being friends because I accidentally dropped a bag of dope in his house. He sold massive amounts of bud at the time and did blow, acid, alcohol, lean if he could get it, but he wasn’t a big sipper or nothing. He was addicted to coke, but never admitted it. So I always thought “how am I the bad person now” which is partially true cause drugs are drugs. What makes yours better than mine?  He flushed it and gave me $50 that I paid to buy it and told me to go home and never talked to me again. It was so weird and that’s when I started losing a lot of close friends. 


Omg, I don’t even want to see the old photos of me rn. I was BADDD! but at the time, felt like I never changed really LOL I remember looking through my phone and finding a note in my phone when I was messed up on fentanyl one night and pretty much made a suicide note cause I thought OD was gonna be my ticket free from all the depression and suffering I felt at the time. I had NOBODY! 

No friends, mom and stepdad kinda kept their distance and locked everything up. I had to get through it all on my own and I’ve still been on my own. I’ve reunited with my old homebody Danny that’s like my brother. Talking to a girl right now, but I’m mostly at work so I don’t have much free time and it’s just easier being alone for me right now. I hate drama and most people are all about drama, being 2-faced, and try to steal my hoes from me. NOT COOL! 😎 🖕",1,t3_1kdcz74

We can’t get Kratom, but we can Kavs shots and I like those sometimes. Candy, ice cream, iced coffee, weed, shrooms, sometimes a perc lol pain pills were never a problem for we weirdly enough. 

Yeah I’ve seen old photos of me in that time and I was just not even surviving anymore. I was barely trying and didn’t care. Wouldn’t shower hardly and stay in bed, nodding off. Sometimes secretly wishing I didn’t wake up. I remember looking through my phone and finding a suicide note in my iPhone notes and a video of where I had a fight, trying to stay sober after 20 clean days and I lost that day and bought some dope and got high. Was so ashamed because I just promised myself and my mother that I was done and actually thought I was done. Guess not.

My mom knew I was having issues, but I never told her it was fentanyl for the longest. Just pain pills (like that made it any better) and my only friend was this chick that actually saved me both times I OD twice in one week, thank god for her cause I’d be dead %100. 

If I did WD at work, it was barely day 1 of having none and I’d either go on my 1 hour lunch break to pick up some or just leave work if I couldn’t get any or was broke. I never went to work every day through 5-6 days of withdrawal. Almost impossible unless you aren’t micromanaged. 

I remember I’d have a job for a while and stay sober at first. Then I’d get some paychecks in and wanted to “treat myself” and then eventually fall right back into dependence. I would say “if I do it for 3-4 days, surely I won’t WD” and that a lie. Every next time it takes less and less to get addicted and have WD. By then it’s either keep going to pay bills or quit my job to WD at home AGAIN until I get fully sober (didn’t happen) or enough money to get more and then get another job to get money that I would say is “for bills”, but the addict voice in me would laugh hysterically and know the money is needed for drugs and fast food. 

I can see how people think they’re possessed by a demon when going through addiction. Cause it’s you, but it’s not you. So weird.

Thinking “god I’m not sick now but fuck me im not normal either” return to the dope. Rinse. Repeat  I’ve literally been in withdrawal hundreds of times. 6 months sober now it finally took enough from me,2,t1_mqaknuc

6334,mv4jree,1kdcz74,Where was somewhere that you WD at and it was horrible?,Boondox24,"Idk why I went through WD as many times as I did. I guess I’m just hard headed and have to explore something fully before I consider stopping, even if it’s killing me. Overdosing twice in one week really accelerated my decision to get clean. Never OD’d in the 4 years I was doing it and then BOOM, OD on a Monday & 3 days later Thursday. I had a feeling god wasn’t gonna give me a 3rd time. My homegirl at the time saved my life. She was my only friend at the time and if I was still getting high behind closed doors. I wouldn’t be here.

I’m so happy for you & glad your mom stayed by your side during it all. I know it was hard on her, but she knew the real you and all that shit was because of the drugs. That’s why addiction is a disease. I use to think “no it’s not, those dope fiends just want to get high and have an excuse too” until I experienced it. The first time was fun, but everyone after was just sadness covered up with a 2 hour high and repeat. 

You want to stop every second of the addiction, but you just can’t. Even when I did WD and be on day 8 (most symptoms are gone, but not all) i would either lie and say “well I can get just a little to make me feel better, but not reset the WD” and you can’t buy 1 line (really dot, not line) so when you do your 1 hit, you got extra and we can’t throw that away, now can we? 🤔 😂 and end up doing the rest and now I can’t stop cause it’s WD central all over again and I had just experienced that. I got a job too and just used all my vacation so now I gotta just keep using and go to work so I have a house with A/C, food, and a place to try and WD again at when I am financially ready (always mentally ready). 

I’ve told myself “just one time won’t hurt” A MILLION TIMES. I finally just stopped bullshitting myself and realized I’m getting older and it’s ridiculous how I’m acting and selfish. 

I don’t miss it, but I am lowkey glad I experienced it cause I know who my real friends are and once you built up a nice life, to have it all taken away, theirs a certain comfort you get when you can survive and not depend on anyone’s help. It takes a strong, mental person to get off drugs with no maintenance drugs like Methadone and no rehab. That’s what I did and it shocked me to see how much mental capacity and restraint I had to just say no and stop for good. (No hate on people who used rehab and methadone, Suboxone) 

If the rest of you junkies would put your energy into a business instead of boosting, stealing, scheming. You’d be stupid rich or at least in a way better position that you only thought could be a dream reality. I remember thinking I was never getting sober and I was just stuck like that. WRONG!",1,t1_mun8ira
6335,mv4x2hz,1kdcz74,Where was somewhere that you WD at and it was horrible?,Boondox24,"If I had a consistent plug and he was walking distance like some people had in the city (I’m in a small city outside the big city), I’d probably still be addicted (possibly), definitely would of been a lot longer and did a lot more. 

You do forget about the bullshit that you dealt with before to get the drugs. Hell, getting that “pull up” text from the plug was a high itself. Knowing that you’re about to get that sweet sensation and every problem melt away until it’s time to deal with it again. 

I had a plug who always ripped me off on the weight, but product was usually fire or the worst, decent. Towards the end of my addiction and I actually 100% knew it this time (somehow), I plotted my “lick” AKA my get back. 

I told him I was gonna be taking a Uber like usual to this McDonalds and will be needing a gram ($100-$120, which is a rip off considering how cheap fentanyl is, they were using H prices still pretty much). So he told me he will meet me there. I had my homegirl pick me up instead and I waited across his house until he left. I then booted and masked up, ran over to his house, jumped though his kitchen window that was busted. I’ve kinda seen where he goes when he would hand me bags at the back door so I go into his little room and opened a shoe box (of course) and there was a bag with 4 grams of rocked fentanyl, 20 school bus xannies, $800, and probably a half of bud.  Took the whole shoe box and dipped. He pulled back up probably 3 minutes after I left and thought someone snitched. No, he forgot something. I start calling him like “dude, I told you I ain’t got much time and I’m going through WD severely. Please don’t leave me hanging, I’ll pay you $20 extra to please get here ASAP!!” 

He was like “Bro, someone broke into my crib and took everything I have and I’m worried about that right now” and I’d say “DUDE! You told me you had some and to pull up, you know that I’m in WD and I hate sounding like a dick, but that’s messed up that I took a Uber out here and now you’re saying you got robbed. Like if you don’t have it, don’t lie to me cause you can’t find any by the time I get there” He bought it all and just said when he figures it out, he’s gonna hook me up. I think he thinks a woman he use to date did it or a homeless person he serves did it. Could be anybody so I wasn’t tripping. He never found out and about 2 weeks later, he told me to pull up and he gave me 1.5 fentanyl for $75 so it was a win win. Got sober shortly after. 

I actually deleted all numbers & eventually got a whole new phone so I couldn’t  unblock numbers and get some like I have done before when I told myself “I’m done” but knew I would have numbers 😂 good times",2,t1_mqdx8at

When I say I tried and tried I almost never made it more than a day before going right back out. I couldn’t make it through the sickness which really solidified it in my mind each and every time that I couldn’t do it. And a lot of the time there were years in between attempts. So it seems you had more resolve than me by far. This is the first clean time I’ve had in 13 years. I have 1.5 years but before this in 15 years I had 2 months once and 1.5 months once back when I was 18 and 21 years old and I will be 34 next month. As far as feeling like I’m not sick but I don’t feel normal so might as well use I definitely went through a period of thinking that way this time but somehow I stuck through it and I’m glad I did. I was on the edge up until about 3 weeks ago, I didn’t know what was going to happen or how it was going to turn out because I felt so tired,terrible and anxious. I decided to try quitting smoking and it gave me my energy back maybe not fully but a good boost and that plus a little bit of confidence back and not feeling complacent was what I needed. I feel much better now. Congratulations on 6 months that is nothing to sneeze at.",3,t1_mqc11cj
6339,mv4pdq3,1kdcz74,Where was somewhere that you WD at and it was horrible?,Boondox24,"You are not insane my friend. Well maybe at that time we were lol yeah that’s EXACTLY what happened to me. My car got repo’d and was 19 at the time (26 now) so when I ran out and didn’t plan to get more, I was stuck at the house. 30 min away from the city. Only enough money for drugs so no uber, had no friends cause I pushed everyone away to get high. 

So I would WD for 4-6 days. I can’t drive in WD even if I could borrow my moms car, ruined that privilege too, and be shitting myself the whole way and potentially wreck. Then by day 6-7 I would have no more severe symptoms, but now I felt empty and dead inside. Nothing excited me, my RLS was still keeping me up and I couldn’t focus on “you’re pretty much clean and sober, keep going”. It was more like “How long will it take to even out? Will I even out? I have to get another job and I don’t have the strength to even fill out a resume and application. How am I gonna stay sane?” Then just like you…I would give in and go get more and tell myself “well you’ve done WD a million times, what’s one more gonna hurt” ignoring the fact that I shouldn’t go one more WD, it should only be one time. 

I swear man, the stuff we put ourselves through.  I would have $150 and uber to and from Birmingham, AL was $100 and then I had $50 to get some fentanyl powder (Blue 30’s weren’t common at the time and idk if they are common now since I’ve left that whole scene) 
Then sometimes I’d get shorted A LOT which I would just take anyway cause I still need some OR I got sold straight bunk and now it’s “do I send the $50 to get back home on dope or do I just go home”
…you’re fucking right I spent the money to get home on another bag from someone else! This time if I get sold bunk, I will be upping a box cutter on a motherfucker and now I’m gonna take everything you got. 

Wow! And then have some stupid story to tell someone to either pick me up or send money for a uber ride home. 

Did that repeatedly for months of WD for a week and returning to drugs for 2-3 weeks and WD again",1,t1_mqc11cj

the world was literally ablaze (covid) and my first thought hit me like a truck. if i had drugs. great. but probably not much. 

i do not miss the people i had to hang around with. i was a lazy addict. i did not want to be around the “low” i was the low. like there’s a difference??? so stupid of a mentality lmao 

my friends? anyone who is still alive is definitely not my friend lol. i always said in addiction you don’t have friends. you just use each other. 
(which proved to be true. time. and time again. )


i love how you said “ the first times fun. “ 
met with immediate sadness after. 

no matter the drug. the age. i’m grown. and you’d think id get it by now (maybe im hard headed too) addiction i think im done with. but addiction isnt *done with me* if that makes sense. (you likely get it while others may not )

everyday there’s something. something looming. something i see that others don’t that if im not mindful every freaking second of the day. i will find a way. and i will get high. and i will be a statistic and a waste. 

while i’m in recovery, or i say im trying to stay in recovery, i don’t count days (i try to make the days count) 

counting days became a slap in the face to me. a challenge and a test with other addicts. (this is just my opinion) 12 steps can help people. and i’ve seen it. which is great. 

but if i fumble. and i have. and i will. because. that’s what we do. but i keep going. and i get up. and try again. over and over. i’ve relapsed a lot. i get stagnant. it’s not even a *hard relapse* per se but it’s enough that , i have more to learn. and more work to be done. 

(it’s exhausting. and some days i wonder how i never ODd - i have but not the way i thought i would. i’ve had close calls. i’ve been harmed many times. i’ve been robbed. i’ve seen a lot of good people die. and it makes you callous over. 

i remember the first time i got off oxy, i missed work for a while. and i came back. and i had an associate who smoked weed. nothing more or less. very hippy like and in tune with herself. 

she said “ what happened? you’ve lost the light in your eyes “ 

i remember her tone. her face. i remember everything about that question. *what happened* 

i cried immediately. i don’t remember if i explained to her. (literally made me cry right now )


circle back to “ the first time is fun “ that was like, 15 years ago mate. It’s not fun and i’m not done.

(eta…. there’s photos i put together. i was explaining this to somebody. i have a family photo. with my ex. and both of us look very happy. there’s light in our eyes. our faces are full of colour and we look good. 

ten years later. i put another picture. we’re both , just done. cooked. underweight. eyes sunken in. it’s the candid poster board of “this is what drugs and trauma do” 

and sure enough. the second photo. our eyes are black. lifeless. no light. it’s actually haunting to see that there’s nothing behind the second set of faces. )",1,t1_mv4jree

Those starting recovery and those recovering with little or a lot  of time know oh to well how important these milestones of overcoming an otherwise hellish lifestyle that keeps one down and away from experiencing the true greatness that is involved with enjoying the gift of a life the way it was meant to be lived. So I’m sure that you now know that through the winding road of escaping the ball and chain that the energy of dragging it around can be very tiring. Recovery definitely isn’t something that comes but with its corks and time. Know that you have started something that there is no going back to no matter the struggle. It does get better and regaining your mojo will return. It will be worth the time it takes. Even though you have to force it exercise and nutrition will be a big part of receiving from the fatigue. I would also recommend fasting for a few days. It will reset your body and start a new repairing process.,5,t3_1kbl086

It feels like such a lonely existence that I can't share how I'm feeling with anyone, because they just don't understand. 

What I'm not sure of next is whether I put myself on a very low maintenance dosage once I'm past acute withdrawal, and tape that off to reduce the side effects.

6371,mq1duz1,1kbl086,I did it! Day 6,Yohanans_zeal,"Hello. So this subject can get pretty deep but I will try to explain in not such an in-depth way. First off fasting is a very important tool that has been practiced for hundreds if not thousands of years. In the Bible Matthew 17:20-21 it was talked about but they have removed it from most bibles conveniently and of course that’s a whole thing in itself. When we eat and continually, the body focuses on putting its energy into breaking down what ever we consume which deters it from healing. This is necessary for repairs within the body which go unnoticed or are usually over looked. Fasting allows the body to repair dead or dying cells as well as assimilate news ones. It allows the body to go through a cleansing process a kind of reboot. Fasting also more importantly but not limited to helps with disease prevention. Many people do not realize that many of the disease we deal with are in direct correlation to parasites. Fasting is very a important way to combat this problem, in so that many have been cured from major diseases due to the protocols associated with fasting.  This may seem to good to be true or hard to believe but is scientifically proven on multiple levels(Hulda Clark goes in-depth about this subject). Talking about the different things associated with Fasting can be sketchy. When we quit opiates trying to eat is not easy due to feeling like crap and our bodies freaking out. It’s like the last thing we want to do which is good because it helps the cleaning and rebooting. If needed though I do recommend chocolate for the withdrawals and comfort along with plenty of food till full to help aid with sleep and plenty of water for dehydration. This can be counter productive to what I explained previous in the beginning but may bring relief until fasting can be managed dependent on withdrawal symptoms. This is a small drawn out over view of why fasting is important. I challenge those to do there research and try fasting it really is a game changer.",2,t1_mpzc7x7

On day 13, we went back to our home to start packing & cleaning to move out. Our room was full of syringes & cottons. It was basically a nightmare. By the end of the last day, all we had left in the house was our mattress. We slept (or laid, wishing we could sleep) there that night. He just said, ""I love you no matter what happens."" He actually has never touched opiates since that day, and we are still together, 13 years in May. Unfortunately, i don't seem to possess as much mental fortitude as him.

I do relate to that feeling tho, not just from music but probably half a dozen or so different times where something hit in just the right way at the exact moment to stir up that sort of profoundly Intense emotional reaction... 

Probably not the case for a lot of folks, but probably not too uncommon among those of us with history of substance abuse, is the realization I came to that my life has been much more tragedy than anything else.

We got clean during that time and never went back to that trailer for like a year. When we finally did it was a mold covered junky time capsule. The shame of seeing all those needles everywhere. Hundreds and hundreds of them all over the bed, floors, bedside tables, bathroom counters, floors.  The blood stained napkins everywhere and. Blood all over the beds and just you know what I mean. The giant boxes of supplies from the needle exchange. The blood squirts all over the ceilings and walls. It was a time capsule of the darkest kind of hell that I still think of so fondly. We've been 4.5 years clean now but we spent 8 years together shooting heroin and it was so much of our life so it's hard to reconcile it as all being bad. 

It blows my mind that we just left it like that, didn't cover any of it up with no shame. The doors didn't even lock on that place so I know the neighbors went in it to creep around bc I found my stuff in a similar broke down palace nextdoor. 

It's wild what we all normalize in addiction. I used to sleep with a pile of needles uncapped around me before the needle exchange bc I was always looking for a good one in the pile. So of course we hoarded them bc access wasn't great to new ones. But to sleep like that in a bed filled with needles. What the fuck!

I don’t recommend it, it causes more harm than good but if you feel it’ll help with long term cravings and your sobriety to give you stability until you get off when your life is in a better place, then do the subs. You get a script from a sub doctor and fill at a pharmacy. a methadone clinic has all these steps, daily dosing, counseling, bottles, traveling is a bitch, and the methadone can mess with your hormones, put on weight, and is extremely hard to get off.

During that time the heroin I used to get turned to fentanyl. When I relapsed, thankfully my higher power said ""DONT DO IT"". Granted I started drinking but the moral of this story is fentanyl is playing Russian roulette. It's also not even opiates. The shit is in everything. 

You're 17 and amazingly looking for help. Personally I had to get to late 30s/early 40s to finally work a program and stay sober. You could have the world by the balls. Life is beautiful when your not a slave to a substance. It's hard sometimes, but a lot easier than chasing a constant fix. 

Reach out to a rehab. I think it's the only way to safely get off that shit. There are tons of adolescent programs but may be able to go to an adult program at 17. Let them get you detoxed medically, under supervision, comfortable, and most importantly locked away without phone or access to world. I'd also recommend doing a long term program, but first step is getting off that garbage. 

The oxy will change. Not a matter of if, but when. Look, when I was fucked up at 17, many 40 year olds were telling me what I am telling you. But I knew better. I was different.  I'm not like ""them"".

To have a partner? A house? Kids? Stable career? Etc etc etc 

—that’s the only thing that will get you through this. If you don’t have a goal or something you want, then nothing you do will work.

My fiance was doing about the same or more when he was your age. That was about 8 years ago. I can’t speak to his personal internal experience, because I’m not him. I’ve experienced addiction (not opiates though), and the only way I could quit was by treating the *actual* problem within myself. For me personally, I couldn’t do it alone. I talked with my psychiatrist about what I’d been doing, and asked for his help getting me off drugs. It worked for me.

For my fiance, again, I can’t speak specifically to his own internal experience, but in my observation he’s in pain. Physically and emotionally. So he tries to make the pain stop. But just because he’s not on opiates anymore doesn’t mean he’s not self medicating anymore—and that’s the problem I see now. He hasn’t addressed what’s going on inside himself. He still thinks he can get through anything because of his tremendous will power. It’s admirable, because he is incredibly resilient. But one day (soon), I hope he chooses to not be miserable anymore. And ask someone for help instead of trying to do everything himself.",1,t1_m6vtcwp

The fact that you only let yourself hide it for 8 months before coming clean is honestly something to be proud of. Most people hide it for much, much longer.

Use the suboxone. If it comes to it, use methadone. Your life is more important than worrying about what medication you're taking. If you need to stay in the suboxone longer, then do it. Don't rush anything. Let yourself stabilize before you even think of getting of the suboxone, otherwise I can almost guarantee you're going to end up using again, and pretty soon you'll be hating yourself because you'll be right back where you were, fighting off withdrawals again.

A little over 25 months clean this time and yes, the beginning was scary and feeling feelings sucked but over the course of time it got to become normal again.  Just like you adjusted to being numb all the time, your mind and body acclimates to being normal again.  Yes you can feel happiness again and euphoria too.  It might not happen right away because your receptors and brain chemistry has to readjust but it will. I like still like adrenaline and fun stuff, and now I can afford buying stuff like a motorcycle and also don't have to worry about it getting stolen or sold for pennies on the dollar to get dope.  I don't do medication assisted treatment (methadone or buprenorphine) but I know many people who do and are successful.  Sounds like it would definitely help you.  I wouldn't consider it a placebo to give you the same high as oxy at all, but if you keep at it, it stabilizes you, and you can get back to being normal again.

6566,n7g1fka,1mk3jai,Does it get better?,xzxnightshade,"It does get better—but it takes time. If you’ve been using for a while, that use often masks underlying physical and mental health issues. When you stop, those issues tend to come to the surface. And if you’re using MAT for early stability, that can sometimes create its own set of health challenges down the line.

I stopped using six years ago. I was on methadone for the first year, then tapered off. It took years—not weeks or months—for my body, mind, and overall health to stabilize and genuinely feel good again. Same with my life: relationships, finances, purpose… it all took time and consistent effort to rebuild.

One thing that’s been a game-changer for me is daily exercise. It gives me a natural endorphin boost, helps with anxiety and stress, and gives me something to feel proud of every single day. That routine became my anchor.

You’ve got to create a system that works for you. Find people who love and support you. If you’ve got insurance, use it—get a solid counselor, a psychiatrist if you need one, and a doctor to help you sort out your physical health. That part matters more than people realize. Opiate use wrecked my hormones, and it took a while to even realize that was part of why I felt so off. Once I got that treated, everything started clicking into place.

After all the damage, the pain, and the people I’ve hurt—it really does get better. So much better that going back isn’t even a temptation. Just remember: Rome wasn’t built in a day. This recovery thing is one day at a time, and every day adds up. I know it sounds so cliche, but I promise you if you commit yourself and do what it takes, the future you want, the person you desire to be is there waiting.

The neurobiological changes caused through opioid addiction can absolutely heal. Neuroplasticity is real, and thank god, our brains are incredibly resilient. 

Obviously, “happiness” is so much more than just chemistry. And I think people who (through whatever means) omit the drug and make few other changes will find themselves “missing something.” I’ve worked hard for my happiness, and continue to. I needed time for neural healing (which can be aided in many ways, from activity/exercise, socialization/human connection, diet, Neurofeedback, et al.), but I also needed to *learn how to live.* As I say often, that’s really what recovery is all about, to me.

When I basically had two pillars in my life — opioids and football/work — in a way things were easier (though so empty, stressful, erratic, less fulfilling, etc.). Learning how to live meant adopting perspective, and ultimately practices, that had never been a part of my adult life. One of those perspective changes was accepting that my mental health required maintenance (you could call it “work”), just like physical or relationship health. Once I accepted that, it became about figuring out what that work entailed. Over time and through trial, I’ve been lucky to find the elements that are most important for me. And I think that is the key: while looking at people who have been “successful” in your mind, I think it’s important to consider their *process* more than their specific “elements.”

My process was identifying what I was missing to begin with, what I lost through 14 years in active addiction, and how to course-correct. For me, that involved a lot more focus on life balance; taking a [biopsychosocial](https://www.curevine.com/resources/bio-pyscho-social-model) approach to my health and healing; learning the purpose of emotions, how to discern and act on/accept them; improving my shame resiliency; figuring out what brought me joy, and committing myself those practices.

I have both depression and generalized anxiety disorder also OCD, and PTSD. I have about 412 days clean today and I wouldn’t change a thing. No my life is definitely not perfect but it’s a heck of a lot better than it was when I was using that’s for damn sure. It will take a little while, but you will get your happiness back for sure.

6578,n7m0zlo,1mk3jai,Does it get better?,teopap91,"I'm on MAT, 4mg Bupe generics daily.
My baseline is treatment resistant depression and anhedonia. Usually those 2 goes hand by hand, but some people are just pure anhedonic without depression symptoms.

When I'm in WDs (before Bupe) and have ran out from my DOC and replace/bridge with Kratom, the depression is getting worse. I forgot how normalness is. My baseline was till Bupe waking up dopesick. That's long gone since the first day on bupe. But life feels so dull, boring and depressing.

What you posted is sth that I think of daily, many times. Will there be normalness and get pleasure out of e.g old passionate for healthy hobbies/habits ?

Honestly, no idea. Being 5 years daily on some weak opioids, it's like learning to walk again. I have no experience, but I believe it will get better, just need time.

Whether being on MAT or not, only distractions and fatigue from your job or sth are your best friends to eventually recover. Even being on bupe, if I am not distracted with sth (plus living with my dementia grandma that doesn't help) I feel crippling anxiety and depression.

For me, Bupe is just WDs blocker and that's it. Methadone as a full agonist initially it will lift your mood, give a waaayyy better ""opiated"" feeling vs Bupe, but like all opis, when the honeymoon period of methadone ends, you'll end up like being on Bupe. Just blockage of WDs.

Beware with methadone If you have cardiovascular problems. It prolongs the QT time.

Bupe on the other hand doesn't make you feel better, it feels like never messed with opis, so you are functional to re-build your life and then taper it.",2,t3_1mk3jai

MAT is one avenue to bridge the two realities of your mental outlook. I took this route and it has its own set of long term issues to hurdle later.

6582,n7iui2m,1mk3jai,Does it get better?,pronotper_vt,"It absolutely does I promise you. I spent my entire life stuck in a hell cycle of addiction and incarceration, which the justice system perpetuated because I was the first heroin raid in my town. I NEVER thought I would feel happiness, joy, excitement, or elation ever again in life. I was hopeless, helpless, and because if my status as property of DOC, powerless. The way I was treated before addiction was officially determined to be a disease you wouldn't believe if I told you.

It fed the fact that I had zero aspirations aside from selling heroin. NOBODY thought I could ever change. I never wanted kids because I knew my addiction was selfish. People were telling me at every funeral, and there were many, that I would be the next and I mostly agreed. I was doing 6-10 buns A DAY when I used last. It's all I did. Now I walk around with painful, puffy, purple hands, feet, and legs knowing that I did it all with my IV drug use. Try explaining that to your littles. I really did a number on my body. Its so humiliated and has killed any self-confidence I once had, if I ever did have any.

Nobody would hire me so every time I got out of jail they would tell me I had 30 days to pay the rent or I'm going back. I always tried so hard until about day 22 when I would start to panic. Then I was making a run just to flip one time. I won't use. It never worked out that way. Never once in that nearly two decades.

In 2016 the guy I was seeing OD'd and my best friend went to jail for selling him the drugs that killed him. I suddenly found myself alone while watching the Super Bowl. I would wake up every morning with Joe Dispenza videos playing on YouTube. It was really hard and I no longer have a friend in the world. It turns out you're not so popular when you stop making it so easy for everyone else to look good. It feels so freaking good to prove them all wrong. Five-time convicted she-felon and I have been sober for nine years now. I will probably have to be on Subutex for quite some time, but that's what works for me. 

9 years ago I checked myself into a homeless shelter to get away from my apartment where I sold drugs. I checked in with the clothes on my back, a 450 credit score, and a correctional GPS perma-strapped around my ankle. Using the law of attraction I purchased my own 350k home three years later. I am now a certified Addiction Recovery & Life ķcoach and I founded a personal development/addiction recovery/spirituality blog called Progressing Not Perfecting[Progressing Not Perfecting](https://www.samanthabushika.com), which you should check out. 

I started trying to be positive no matter what to prove Joe Dispenza wrong. I just kept proving him right. As soon as I changed my mindset I stopped going back to jail! I know how hard it is but positivity did something to me. I haven't even had a craving in 9 years. I write about it a lot on my blog. I started meditating, even with my ADHD, and using I Am affirmations. 

Last year I even quit smoking! Now I am trying to quit swearing. I think it's the hardest to quit. When I stopped using and got off methadone I never thought I would feel okay again. It took a while and a huge mindset makeover, but I promise you that if you stay positive your life will fucking transform.

You will start seeing angel numbers everywhere. I tell all of my clients when they are feeling at their lowest to ask the Universe for a sign. Just say ""as a show of good faith and so I know that you're listening please show me a__________ (whatever your thing is frog, dragonfly, etc.) Within the next 48-72 hours."" I haven't been disappointed yet. It gets so freaking much better. Please stay strong and if you need support find me. I will help in any way I can. Helping others helps me.

By July 2024, I was a complete mess. Xylazine had finally reached my city, and I had my own short-lived experience with it. I now have huge scars on my right hand, the back of my right arm, on the tops of both of my feet, and a nice, big chunk taken out of my right ankle. I ended up in the ER wondering if I was going to lose my foot or my hand. That was enough for me. I had been a dope fiend for 18 years at that point. I had evolved with dope game every time it changed, but not this time. And now I am coming up on a year sober (08.27.24), and I only failed my first urine when I came back to the clinic last July.

Download an app called chronometer.
You can plot in what you eat exactly and it shows all the amino acid, fats, vitamins and proteins that you get.

It's sustainable but expensive. You gotta be dedicated to it. But if you do you will reap the benefits! You could try for a couple of weeks and see how you feel!

Yes you have to eat a L O T of fruit. I liked making frozen blended bananas. It's called nice cream by vegans. It's like soft ice! 

I liked juicing also. Make sure to get a slow juicer tho as that makes juice by churning/grinding the fruit instead of blending it- so the vitamins and minerals are kept in the juice. The conventional blender juicers spin so fast, it heats up so many of the vitamins and minerals are killed off/pasteurised.

I liked smoothies too.

And cold soups. Like gazpacho! That is an amazing meal..

But the chronometer app will be your friend as you really gotta keep track of the nutrition, or you  could easily make a really bad diet for yourself.

Another great raw food/fruitarian meal is spiralized zucchini squash with either guacamole, herb dressing or a tomato and Sun dried tomato sauce!!

I loved eating melons for breakfast.

Also look into fruit combining. Some fruits are better digested together than others!

I feel zero difference between day 2 and day 120 and everything in between. This is the smaller, 100mg shot. I'm currently on week 7 after taking only half, or 50mg the last shot.

For me, the long term plan is to continually increase the spacing of shots and be done. The great thing is that there are a lot of copay assistance programs specifically for sublocade that will pay anything that insurance doesn't (first program was for like 12 shots and the last like 14 - no income requirement/restriction).

I assumed, and still feel there is a great chance, that because of how little I was taking so infrequently, along with the fact that my labs were essentially testing at 0 bupe in my system at the 3 month mark, that I was completely out of the woods as far as withdrawal (since I've never felt anything negative). I've read here a couple people saying it sets in between 3-4 months, so now I'm just going to keep spacing them out longer each time to test the theory.

We are all someone’s child here!

I was an honors student in high school 
I am a college graduate that got a full ride
I graduated with my masters in 1.5 years while working full time with a newborn and a single mom!

I got breast implants 
One busted, in to my underarm!
Doctor wanted 10k to fix it!
Then that week, I got a sinus infection, my nose was so swollen, my head was killing me, 
And that was the start! 
My “friend” handed me a pill to help the pain!

I’m losing EVERYTHING! My house, can’t pay my bills, I’m deadly afraid every day taking something that will kill me and leave my kids motherless! I have no one to talk to!

I want to stop!
I don’t know how!
Literally, don’t know how to do it!
I have comfort meds from a doctor who literally was hitting on me and telling me he couldn’t believe “someone like me is sitting on his patient table” it was disgusting!!!
He gave me no help but a bag filled with scripts with comfort meds to quit and no directions!!!

I don’t know how to navigate this!!

I was on opiates for 20 years and what worked for me eventually was getting on methadone for 3 years and then I got off everything with four Sublocade shots.  You might want to look into the sublocade and just do that.  It's a once a month shot and you don't even have to take anything and it leans you off slowly and you probably only need a couple.  My last methadone ghost was July 8th 2024 in my last sublocade shot was October 28th 2024 I haven't used any opiate since then.  I've had barely any energy for months but I'll take that as I can get through that mentally I don't want to go back to the opiates at all and I'm glad it's very different this time. 
Like I said I'm really really sorry about your situation especially your house.  It's amazing what you did to get your degree that quickly especially with a kid also!

6672,miq5uei,1jexpgh,My child,Sea_Field_8209,"They want you to take suboxone for at least a week or two to make sure you've gotten all the other opiates out of your system.  It sounds like you're taking fentanyl I don't need to know but it sounds like that's what you're taking, but if you're taking something like oxycontin or morphine that would be ideal as you could get on Suboxone right away and you'd only have to be on it for a week or two before you got your first sublocade shot.  
If you are on fentanyl the unfortunate thing with that is is it's lipophilic and it takes a while to leave your system and it's hard to get on buprenorphine or Suboxone from Fentanyl.  
For me I switched from methadone to Suboxone by taking a short acting opiate for a week.  You can do this even while taking something legal called seven hydroxy pills.  Or if you have access to actual oxycontin which I had access to actual oxycontin also I just took that for a week and then was able to get on Suboxone for two weeks and then I got my first sublocade shot.  
Most sublocade doctors want you to be on Suboxone for at least one week before they give you first shot.  And if you cannot get real oxycontin which most people can't, like I said there are things called seven hydroxy pills made from really concentrated kratom that you can take that are legal and that will get you through for the first 5 days until you can take Suboxone for a week or two and then take your first shot.

6686,m9z9oub,1icxi0h,"going through it rn, why did i go back to opiates?",red_neck_beard,"Sorry to hear it. Hope you're feeling better. I did oxys for 15 years or so until actual pills ran out and everything turned into fentanyl blues. Quit those 3-4 years ago for about 6 months until I was bored and found some real 30's. They didn't do anything and before I knew it I was snorting fentanyl powder until 3 months ago. I really pray you never graduate to fetty. It's pure evil. 

The question in the title really stuck out to me. Why did I go back to opiates? I asked myself that a lot every time I relapsed for the last 20 years. The answer is simple but it eluded me until I started going to NA. 

We relapse because we're addicts. Addiction is a cunning enemy and a progressive disease. Every time we get clean, while we're not using drugs, we're still addicts. While clean our addiction isn't meekly waiting for us to come back to it. It's doing pushups and getting swole just waiting for the chance to kick our ass. There is no cure for addiction. We can arrest the disease of addiction through recovery but we have a problem with all mood and mind altering chemicals and with even the slightest opening they will consume our lives until we are nothing but a dessicated husk.

Without recovery there are 3 ways our addiction ends. Jails, institutions, or death. Our addiction literally wants to take everything from us until it's the only thing left. Saying all that, recovery is possible. If you really want to stop living in active addiction I can't suggest a program like NA strongly enough. Support from peers who have been thru the same shit is invaluable. We can't do it alone. Even better though is a proven way of living clean and in recovery. Something that has worked for thousands or millions of addicts can work for us too. 

I know this is long and I hope I don't come off as preaching to you. Your post really stood out to me. I sincerely wish you nothing but the best and I hope you never have to experience another relapse again. We are all worth a life free of drugs and we all owe it to ourselves to exhaust every option and turn every rock to find out how. Best of luck to you",3,t3_1icxi0h

Recovery is by no means easy but it's made easier because I'm basically following in the footsteps of those who are at the meetings and who came before me. It's a proven way to stay clean. I like how you said it always starts as pain management but that's never how it ends. It's not just you. I'm really glad you were able to keep everything down for almost a day now. Makes it seem like the worst is over. I never threw up for 52 hours but I remember when I was doing blues in the beginning I would throw up bile for a day or so. It was the worst. I'd get to the point where I couldn't even throw up bile anymore and I would have super painful dry heaves for what seemed like forever. Not fun, sorry you had to go through something similar for over 2 days, I can't imagine. Sometimes we have to go through the shit until the lesson gets learned. The first time I detoxed off of fetty was cold turkey and it was the worst 5 days of my life and on day 6 I slept like a baby and was back to almost %100 which is unheard of. I didn't learn the lesson tho. The 2nd time was 3 months ago it was kind of a medical detox and the 5 days weren't as bad as before but physically I'm still not back to %100. My vision was hella blurry for almost 2 months. I still barely sleep and have no energy. The lesson is being learned this time at least.

I just want to say something about the 12 steps real quick if you really want to go for recovery. In meetings I hear people say a lot that if you go to meetings you can stay clean but if you really want to go for recovery you have to do step work. I didn't really know what that meant until I started on the 1st step. The first step in the guide book is almost 70 questions. 1st step has the most questions but the 12 steps are no joke. It's really about getting to know yourself and get down to the nitty gritty of our addiction. 

Wish you the best and you got this. Just know you're not alone and make sure to give yourself grace and understanding. You deserve to live the best life possible as your best self. If you ever have questions or need to talk or vent hit me up or find someone who has gone thru it that you feel comfortable talking to. I don't know about other programs in particular but if you go to NA or AA the first time they will give you a phone list so you will have somebody you can call or text if you ever feel like using or need to talk to someone. Whatever you decide really hope you crush it and kick addiction in the ass",2,t1_m9zcbdk

The injections did help me!  And if one of them doesn’t work, then there are two others to try.  Another treatment that you don’t hear of often that greatly helped me is a sphenocath. And the most infuriating thing is to hear that migraines are just headaches.

I'm still not able to eat a lot and the muscle and bone pains are preventing me from sleeping, but I smoked some weed and it helped so much with the nausea and general feeling of death. Thanks for replying and distracting me when I was in the thick of it.

I didn't know that withdrawals could fuck up your vision, I'm glad I didn't experience that. Sharing your story really helped me put things into perspective, I definitely need therapy of some kind and maybe recovery too. I'm not sure we have the twelve step program where I live, but I assume that I can find all the info online and apply it myself. I'm just gonna stay cali sober for now, weed immensely helps with my migraines and depression. Alcohol is also a slippery slope, because I will go through phases of abusing it routinely and then not touching it for months. For now I will only partake in the devil's lettuce and hopefully I don't ever get the urge to do oxy's again, it was always more about the idea of relief and being high than the actual feeling of it for me.

I know a lot of people who smoke for appetite and if it works for migraines too then it's good you have something that helps. I'd definitely try and stay away from alcohol, especially since you said you have a history with it. I just hope you find some peer support. Online, phone calls, zoom meetings whatever it looks like. It's important to not feel alone in the struggle and even better with people who know all about the struggle. I really wish you the best. We need more success stories.

And five days is an incredible achievement; don't let yourself forget that for one moment. Detoxing from opioids is like writing a novel; the vast majority of people who set out to accomplish what you set out to accomplish have already failed by the point that you're at. 

Two tools that really helped me are (1) journaling, and (2) mindfulness meditation / guided relaxation exercises / and cognitive re-framing techniques from CBT and DBT. 

If you're interested, I've compiled [75 prompts](https://www.concreteconfessionalblog.com/post/75-dynamic-writing-prompts-for-addiction-recovery-journaling) about addiction / recovery, spirituality, self-growth, and other positive topics for people who, like me, benefit from journaling. There are some fun and creative ideas thrown in there, too.

I also wrote a guide to CBT, DBT, psychodynamic therapy, and Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy [here](https://www.concreteconfessionalblog.com/post/cbt-dbt-rebt-emdr-untangling-the-therapy-alphabet-four-questions-to-answer-before-you-book-you); I provided a guide consisting of four questions to ask yourself to help determine which therapeutic approach will best suit you. If you put in the work, the well-being that you can achieve is remarkable, truly.

The sooner you can begin exercising to the capacity that your body is capable of right now, the quicker you'll start feeling ""normal"" again.

Hang in there. You have given yourself an absolutely beautiful gift for the new year, and the freedom and purity that you'll be feeling a few weeks or months from now are so, so worth what you're going through right now.

Coke was my first DOC and then Opiates! But opiates are the only thing that had me relapse multiple times a month. Coke withdrawals was nothing. I slept a whole week. Got tired of that. Jumped on oxy’s and abused it for 10+ years on a daily basis! My last oxy use was end of December 2023. Went through the withdrawal process with no withdrawals using the Megadose Vitamin C protocol. Knowing that it was easy to beat the Acutes. I know what I have to do. So got the Suboclade shot. I now have 1 year sober using the shot to help!

I don’t drink or smoke. I tried a few times, wound up back on my DOC (heroin) real quick and it was straight back to rehab. I haven’t gone to a meeting in probably 3 years. I don’t recommend doing that.

I still credit the program for my success. The ideas of radical honesty, responsibility and accountability, and the idea of total abstinence without reservation are key not just to my recovery, but also core characteristics of the person that I decided I wanted to be when I was rebuilding my life.

I know a few people in recovery who drink or smoke in moderation, but they never got super bad off to begin with. I know a lot more dead people who tried to follow their example.

On a separate note, 12 step programs define sobriety as abstinence from all mind altering substances, so you’re not going to get many affirmative responses to your question.

I discovered inadvertently that I partake occasionally without issue. I still go to meetings and my husband and I chat about recovery semi regularly, it’s a big part of both of our lives. 

I wouldn’t recommend it, I think I happened to discover it on accident in a sense. Alcohol and weed were never gateway drugs for me though, opiates came 10+ years later. Maybe that’s why it’s not a trigger for me. Or staying active in my recovery from opiates. I love my group and mentors as well as my freedom from that addiction.

I know if I were to go to those same meetings I was going to weekly before I'd get an earful about how I'm using again because of my smoking. 

Meetings helped me initially but at a certain point they became a hassle especially when I was going multiple times a week. I'm lucky enough to have a good support network without really needing the meetings. I can't say the last time I've had a real craving for my DOC's (heroin & IV coke/crack). Anytime I've ever had a relapse in the past I went straight for my DOC's. Never started with alcohol or weed and slowly progressed, no, I'd just immediately be driving to the dope spot. 

I've been to over 15 treatment/detox centers and been to thousands of meetings in the 20+ years I've dealt with addiction. Took me too long to really learn treatment is not a one size fits all thing. So please don't take my response as an excuse to start smoking. It took me a long time to get to this point in my life.

Even though they say it’s apart of the process, the people would gossip, look down upon you etc. I felt like I was really being held back. After my sponsor relapsed (11 years clean at the time, I had 1.5) I left the program and have never looked back. It truly helped me and motivated me in the beginning, it’s how I got clean, but I had to leave to stay clean. There was too much click-iness among the rooms I frequented, too much gossip, not enough equality, compassion and care for others. There were of course those that were, though that was the minority. I haven’t look back since and have done so much healing another other groups of people on the healing journey. I don’t drink, though did use marijuana for a while. To each their own.

Admittedly, I was consciously trading addictions because I drank every day.  

After the DUI, I called it quits on drinking too.  Nowadays the only shit I do is kratom, which I used as an alternative to Suboxone to get off dope, and medical marijuana.  I don't go to meetings or work a program and I take a spoonful of kratom a couple times a day at least 5 hours apart.  I don't mess with 7oh or extracts, just the powder.  Part of the reason I take it, aside from scratching the itch enough that I don't pick up, is because it puts me in a good mood and helps my sense of well being in conjunction with my antidepressant (cymbalta if anyone is counting).

I was a functional alcoholic but quitting alcohol made life SO MUCH EASIER and I am glad to finally be free of the worst of my burdens.  I'm still dealing with the fallout of the DUI but things are good otherwise.  All my bills are paid, I'm eating good, and I have enough left to save money.",2,t3_1nuyze0
6784,nhbwfde,1nuyze0,If you have long term sobriety- do you still drink? Do you go to meetings?,-TrueMyth-,"I was clean from 24 to 38, first time in recovery beating the odds.

AA worked until it didn’t. I went for the first 3 years but realized it was no longer serving me. And then, I found something that WAS and on a different level.

After giving up opiates I hit the gym, first chasing a six pack, then finding discipline, pride, and comfort in my own skin. Lifting gave me more than Oxy ever could. I stopped complaining and just did. I went back to college and graduated magna cum laude. That is sobriety. It makes you believe you can and then you do.  But then I'd be sitting in AA where I'm constantly reminded of how powerless I am.  I get the concept, started to resent the messaging.  Tell someone they're powerless too often, it becomes a limiting self bias.  I once reminded someone YOU had the power to come here, don't forget what YOU can do when you feel weak.  And I was told that was ""dangerous"" advice.  

Over time I sat in meetings asking myself why I was there. I saw cliques, gossip, and judgment. I once shared ""I'm grateful for this program and many people in it, but I think I'm ready to apply the tools I've learned here and stay clean without this support group"".  A few people approached me after the meeting and said I'd be dead in a week.  A week later, some people told me I was a threat to their sobriety and they cold not longer associate with me. That was my cue to leave. I stayed clean another 10 years with zero cravings.

THEN...

In 2020 I relapsed after 14 years. It was not from a craving or forgetting what I had learned. I loved being sober. I needed to get wisdom tooth surgery, and told the doctors I was a recovering addict and did not want pain killers. They pushed back, I declined a 2nd time.  The day of the surgery they handed me a script of 25 perks 5mg.  I handed it back, respectfully...no thank you I said...time #3.  Somehow to my shock, even though I refused meds over an over, my brother (who drove me home from sugary) pulled out a filled bottle of pain meds and put them on my counter saying they gave him the script when I was unconscious and suggested he fill it ""just in case"". My brother gave me when my face was badly swollen and promised he would not leave them there...he forgot to take them. I used the rest as prescribed and for pain. But the guilt of enjoying it haunted me a year and half.  ""Did I relapse? Did I throw away 14 years of hard work???"" I'd ask myself.

A year later I decided it was a relapse (mostly because I had guilt over enjoying the feeling). Slowly I started redefining myself as someone who took painkillers when in pain. That self talk wrecked me....and then one day, I believed I had ""no sobriety streak"" and gave myself permission to use..and within 4 months I was up to 40 fent pills a day. It took everything.

Now I am 18 months clean from opiates. I still use non prescribed Adderall, full disclosure. Can you be sober without AA? Yes. But life throws curveballs. If my doctor had listened or my brother had remembered, maybe I would still have my streak. But life is not fair.

Alcohol was the number one driver in chronic relapse the last 9ish months I was out. I just wanted to “go back to drinking”. Now, while I am an advocate for abstinence and 12 step, I also understand the pushy black and white nature of those programs.

The fundamental problem with quitting meetings and experimenting with alcohol as a primarily narcotics/opiate user is: if you wind up being wrong, by the time you realize it, it is almost certainly too late.

I could sit here all day and imagine what I would do if I started drinking and things got out of control, but I know from personal experience that it’s not that simple. At least not for me.

It comes down to risk vs reward. Are those lifestyle changes worth the risk of what you currently have? I ask that openly, and not to deter you. You have to weigh the options and make the decision yourself. 

My only suggestion is, if you decide to go that route, make sure you make peace with either outcome prior to moving forward.

I hate the attitude towards MAT, the disregard for harm reduction, perpetuating shame and stereotypes..

I’m just curious on others experiences since all I’ve heard is stories of spiraling immediately when drinking, and the program can be a bit single minded. I do understand many people have thought the same as me and ended up using again or worse after trying to drink casually, I’m just curious about a wider range of experiences than I’ll find in the rooms.

6810,nkw5htf,1nuyze0,If you have long term sobriety- do you still drink? Do you go to meetings?,saulmcgill3556,"Again, I strongly disagree with what you’re presenting as AA guidelines — as well as as the flawed logic used to support it. But I manually approved this comment as you’re entitled to express your opinion respectfully. 

What probably rubs me wrong the most about your comment is that you refer to people being on a doctor-ordered SSRI as “dirty” — as a dirty little secret. 1) Medication is not supposed to be secretive in AA. 2) I totally understand why some people would find that insulting. I just accept it as ignorance. I think it shows a fundamental lack of understanding of 12-step theology — even if you subscribe to the most rigid, dogmatic, personally-twisted interpretation — but that doesn’t *offend* me. I think it’s a very poor (mis)representation of AA, but it’s up to other people to decide how to discern information.

The fact is: the example you gave here, as well as in another comment, is not a grey area at all. Alcoholics Anonymous is very clear about *its interpretation* and treatment of such prescribed medications. Your comment infers just the opposite. It also manipulates the subject matter by moving from the aforementioned medication to describing it as a drug comparable to any other — specifically you say, Zoloft, alcohol and cocaine are equivalent. I’m glad that you are alive and sober, but it sounds like you’ve adopted some very distorted beliefs of your own (perhaps that’s what you needed) and are presenting them as the as the principles of AA. If I were an active member of AA (I’m intimately familiar with the organization, the doctrine, its history and current positions) I wouldn’t appreciate that kind of mischaracterization.

Respectfully, your idea about “what substance use is” is incredibly myopic. And it seems to me you are not “living life on life’s terms” because you are relying on coping mechanisms from a flawed belief system. While that may have enabled you to keep certain substances out of your body, that is the same description of any another maladaptive behavior. This makes it sound distinctly like you are living life on *your* terms. Abstinence is not a full-hearted acceptance of life on life’s terms. Abstinence is also different than recovery. I get the sense you would agree with that point, but what you’re expressing seems to directly contradict that.

I lost everything including my customers and by the time I got clean I was nearly homeless and had nothing and no one.

I def miss moving weight and being that guy but I think a big part of the reason I have been ok was because I’ve had a good amount of time to recover. 

That’s literally the entire reason I don’t fw the program and the people. I know not all of them are like the people that are holier than thou and are judgmental to the people who can drink or smoke and be ok but there’s enough of them to turn me off.

I dont have long term sobriety, but I’ve been clean the majority of the last two years, with several days to week long relapses in between, and been going to meetings daily for almost a year. I am struggling with this exact thing right now, all or nothing thinking in the program. My DOC is opiates, I don’t care for booze at all, and I’ve had a single drink on a few occasions and saw no problems with it. I honestly don’t mind abstaining from liquor tho cuz it’s really not that attractive to me, I could take it or leave it. 

I also smoke weed every night, usually just a few puffs off my vape while I’m watching tv before bed. I don’t see the problem with it. I’ve smoked nearly daily since I was 14, im 37 now. The idea that it will inevitably lead me back to my DOC seems ridiculous to me. 

But lately I’ve been feeling very guilty about smoking weed and even taking my prescription gabapentin and clonazepam. I’m prescribed 3 300mg gabapentin everyday, and most days I take 1. I’m prescribed up to 3 .5mg clonazepam a day, and most days I take 1, but lately I’ve been trying to take none, so it’s been more like 3 pills a week. I feel proud of myself when I made it the whole day and night with nothing, and feel bad and guilty when I do take something. 

I talked about this with my therapist yesterday, and she was saying to try not putting my meds and weed in the same category, encouraging me to utilize the meds instead of playing this weird “can I hold off and deprive myself” game. She pointed out I subscribe to all or nothing thinking in many areas of my life. I’m really conflicted, cuz I feel like I’m not being honest with the program. I have talked with my sponsor about the meds, but I haven’t told her about the weed. I’m afraid she won’t sponsor me and won’t consider me clean. I’m afraid none of my new friends/support people will accept me if I’m open about the weed thing. 

I’m so conflicted. Maybe NA isn’t for me? I like it tho, I go to AA/HA/NA every day sometimes multiple times, I enjoy the community and book study meetings, listening to shares, even doing the step working guide. But I also feel like a liar.",1,t1_nh55u66

I had this fantasy that under the right conditions I could drink and smoke in moderation. I had this weird obsession with having a glass of champagne on my wedding day (I was single at the time).

In reality, weed and alcohol always led me straight back to H in a relatively short amount of time. 

Of course, being a stubborn 21 year old, I had to prove this to myself through trial and error.

My only regret is the time I wasted trying to find some easier, softer way.

6823,nhaw6ll,1nuyze0,If you have long term sobriety- do you still drink? Do you go to meetings?,Chubbyhuahua,"Yah I guess I’m confused. Maybe there are regional differences. In the here Northeast US 12 step programs promote abstinence from all mood and mind altering substances not prescribed by a doctor. I think the program has benefits for people, sobriety or not, all the big book says is clean up your shit, be of service, recognize when you’re a dick, and try and be better. 

If a pysch prescribes you zoloft that’s totally fine - I personally believe they are over prescribed - you’re supposed to have bad days. As an addict, we get so caught up in trying to hide from our feelings that we forget that you wouldn’t be human if you didn’t have bad days. 

I’m down for you to come to meetings and socialize and call me if you’re drinking but I don’t think you should collect chips. Harm reduction is amazing but I do see 12 step programs as places of abstinence.

But what is amazing about recovery is you get to decide what works for you. There are a plethora of non abstinence oriented programs out there. Honestly, I just don’t want to see you in casket. 

Just to wrap, if someone, anyone really, can’t acknowledge that there are different paths in recovery, which I readily do, then I’m just overall worried about that persons ability to operate in the world - especially as someone sober or in harm reduction.

I also fully believe it encourages so much guilt and shame around it and can contribute to people having more severe relapses because of the shame from having one drink or smoking once etc and believing the whole allergy thing. 

It feels like a one size fits all program with no room for difference. But at the same time I do really love the community and having a guide to doing work on myself that I know I need to do. But it also really doesn’t feel good to omit that I was drinking casually, I did feel like a liar and when I told my sponsor she did tell me she couldn’t sponsor me if I was drinking at all. I don’t relate to a lot of parts of the program and instead of being encouraged to shape it to work with me, I’m told that I do relate and just don’t know it yet…

I think this is on my mind since I’ve been struggling with my program lately, and realizing I have some fundamental disagreements with what’s proving to be necessary and equally fundamental parts of the program.

I am focusing on my future and going to school soon, I’ve made some major improvements in my life in the last 10 months and my quality of life is much better, and I’m trying to figure out what I want in life long term.

I’ll be the first to say I don’t agree with a lot of aspects of the 12 step program. The higher power thing never resonated with me, and I agree with your points regarding harm reduction.

For what it’s worth, I never had a drinking problem. I didn’t even really like alcohol. Hell, I was barely drinking age when I got clean. 

For me, a relapse never starts with my drug of choice. It starts with something much easier to rationalize. The social pressure to drink in your early 20’s (and even later in life) is enormous, and the fear of having to learn to socialize without it was a big reservation for me, and letting go of that reservation came with a distinct sense of loss and grief.

Life looks different for me today than I ever thought it would. Some would even look at it and say it’s boring. I have come to appreciate the stability that recovery has brought me. I’ve had more than my share of thrills. ",3,t1_nh58g6n

I feel horrible that I’m a mess and it not related to a loved one in distress. I had a job for almost a decade and thought I was on track to own one day. This job…..I worked my way up to lead and thought I had made myself as irreplaceable as possible. Boss has been trying to sell and that hasn’t worked in 5 years and previously I was in the sale contract to have my job solidified. I guess this sale out of nowhere happened a month ago in so fast of time. I of course was told for last month to stop worrying and nothing would change. Boss knows I worry about everything all the time. New owner fired me a day before we were to reopen order new owner. My identity is gone and I can talk myself into anything. I was wrong about everything I thought I knew to be correct. I can’t believe I was correct to be wary of trusting anyone. My even boss said at the time of sale” why won’t you stop worrying and just trust me,I have never had anything but your best interest at heart. New owner fired me a couple weeks later with never even seeing me work. The smart part of me knows I couldn’t have done anything,but the junkie in me feels like I’m an idiot for just everything.

I lost my marriage as a result of my opioid addiction and no judge would have given me custody - even so I would have done it so that my son's parents weren't in 2 different states.  It was horrible.  I'm a substance abuse counselor in private practice today.  I've been clean 21 years. The book is called 'How to Stop Gambling the Easy Way' by Allen Carr.  I could not have used this for my opioid addiction - that required a detox that no 'easy way' book is going to cure.  He's got a million books and they are mostly the same.  I just scoured the internet and I don't see one for opioid addiction but there is one for Cocaine and you literally just replace the word coke with heroin.  Currently I'll get bouts of depression (I 100% self-medicated) and these random podcasts help a ton.  There's a site called Sobercast (if you have an iPhone you can download the app) which is nothing but pretty good speakers.  It's AA-based.  I've never been an alcoholic (drugs only) but I still get a lot out of those.  I have found a ton of really great podcasts lately.  I am of the opinion that a lot of us, not all, need to maintain our recovery by doing more than just abstinence.  Maintenance looks different for everyone.  We live in a time right now where we have what I would consider excellent treatment options in the palm of our hands.  When you're at home and dealing with all that you described, throw in one earbud (so you're not completely isolated from family) and listen to something recovery-related.  There are some really good, free apps out there too. My spiritual Toolkit is excellent.  If you have any friends in recovery you can write out a resentment that you're dealing with and share it.  You've got so much going on in your head - it needs to come out.  Or it at least needs to be processed differently.  A sick mind cannot fix a sick mind.  That goes for me today just as much as it did in the beginning.  I've got a masters degree in this shit and I can't counsel my own self.  You're a freaking Rockstar for making this post.  You do not want to use, to throw it all away, or you wouldn't have made the post.  You knew people would reply.  You needed people to reply.  YOU NEED PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND.  Please find a way to get connected with other addicts.  I don't care if this is done via Zoom, in person, doesn't matter.  Something needs to change.  I don't even know you and I'm very proud of you.",1,t3_1kj42lq

Bought fentanyl because I knew it would break through and thought I could just do a tiny bump here or there til the pharmacy was back in stock of suboxone
I did a little tiny bump had a fucking panic attack thought I was gonna die (I probably wasn’t but my mind and the panic attack was bad) made my dealer come back and bring me to his house and baby sit me in case I died I didn’t want to be alone

I’ve been off suboxone now like 3 months because I realized first of all it’s stupid…AF! And second the pharmacy controlling me is insane.

My wife and I have been on the rocks for awhile, but here hurt and suffering due to my past addiction turned to hatred and scorn, and now she is honestly.. well pretty emotionally and verbally abusive. But I'm also co dependant and she's my rock so it shatters my world when she tells me things like ""I fucking hate you. I can't stand to look at you eww leave me alone"" and stuff.

I have this severe muscular pain throughout my entire body that has debilitated me recently, and I don't know what's going on yet medically with me.

I have a lot of other stuff on the side too, but those are the main ones I can think of atm. I've been hurting so bad all day at work and playing it off like I'm okay, and then i come home and I was already craving bad and my wife started in on me over asking her if she was okay and trying to figure out what was on her mind.

It’s debilitating. We all start up again by being triggered by something in our lives. It’s normal to feel this way with that level of stress that’s incessant and constant, you are VALID TO feel these cravings again for heroin by that level of stress and trauma you’re going through. 

Just remember though, short term there will be relief, but very quickly; within days, without it, when you do t have it and mentally you’re still in the same position with the family and events going on in your life, just imagine the rawness you’ll feel then when you don’t have that opiate attaching and activating your opioid receptors. It’ll be rawness to the point of a mental breakdown. The anxiety; the sadness, the hopelessness, the depression, the fear, the worry. 

Your brain will be stripped of its natural social bonding and safety signalling net, you’ll have no longer natural signalling of dopamine, and endorphins, your dynorphins will be running rife causing a cascade of hellish dysphoria and anhedonia, but you’ll only feel sadness, depression, anxiety and fear.",2,t1_mrjvbxa

And I would inevitably justify, deny, and excuse my way into another use, then another and another. 

I honestly, even with my plights with them, am all for most forms of drug use if that is what people want to do with themselves and their bodies. Not heroin though. It just feels too good.

It weans down incredibly slowly from a maximum dose of buprenorphine all the way to zero with no ""jumping off"" point. I got my last of 6 shots 2 months ago and have felt zero symptoms so far, most people say they experience nothing but perhaps a little fatigue over the 1-2 years it takes to taper down. 

I'm really sorry to hear about your wife man. Unfortunately some people's reaction is to run away from a tough situation. It sounds like you've licked the demon that is cancer and now you only have the treatment induced demon to contend with. Fucked up as it sounds, that's good news of sorts as they actually finally came up with a good solution for the latter of those. A couple sublocade shots could be exactly what you need to start moving on with your life. 

Or if you're already through the worst of it at the time of this writing and want to tough it out, that's valid too. You've survived so much, you got this! There are good days ahead. After going through hell all the good things will be that much sweeter I promise you.",2,t3_1jdgeci

Now you can beat the addiction and show her what she missed out on. I know you want to be done with this now but it wouldn’t hurt to look into suboxone or methadone as well. If you haven’t hit the worst of the withdrawals yet it’s going to be hard to function when you get there. I wish you would have reached out before quitting so we all could have given you some ideas on how to prepare. It’s hard not knowing exactly how much and what you’ve been taking. The oxy and dilly’s have a fairly short half life I believe so that’s good but I’m not sure about the fent patches. I know it’s not like street fent though. Do you have any comfort meds to help you? Try to drink plenty of fluids. Eat something mild if you can. Imodium is great for diarrhea and you should take at least double what the box says. Search vitamin C megadoses on this site.

Unfortunately it is more common than you’d think. There are a lot of hardworking good men out here getting royally screwed over by inconsiderate selfish women. It’s hard to get over your love especially for men but there’s a reason that a tested person who is un loyal is removed from the equation. Then the cancer part and the time frame. But you made it through what a testimony so far and to be had for the future. That in itself is an obvious statement that there’s more ahead. Your next endeavor is definitely not going to be the easiest as you well know but can be done. I was in almost 25 years with opiates that cost me years and my heart which forced me to stop or die. It was a blessing in disguise. Going cold in your situation usually isn’t recommended but I will give you a few things I found that do help: chocolate or sweets but mainly chocolate, eating which keeps you occupied and getting full so you can sleep, hot showers or baths, T.V. which is brain rot but keeps you stimulated, exercise which will be hard at first(you have to make yourself)but really does help its a big one. Using other substances are a bandaid but can help with the withdrawals. I found microdosing mushrooms to be the best and natural way to approach that. I personally wouldn’t do Kratom due the fact it can be habit forming and because it’s what caused what I said earlier in my case. I don’t know about subs but maybe it can help.

But there are conditions that are so unbelievably painful and somehow I survived all of it. Barely.. the chemo caused additional pain that was very toxic but they were throwing everything at me.. you could count the bones in my body because everyone of my bones hurt. Even the bones in my ears. But the cancer hated it as much as me so I beat it. Took many painful years just to get the chemotherapy out of my body

I kicked dirty street Fentanyl once cold turkey, lasted 6 weeks before relapse. I go to the methadone clinic now and it has saved my life undoubtedly. In a few more months I'll start to wean down and eventually off. Of course our addiction stories are worlds apart, but the symptoms are real similar. 

My addiction counselor has been super helpful but I know in my situation, I have a lot of trauma to work through. When I'm putting in the work, the rest comes easier. No urges to use or whatever, just improve and grow. Keeps me focused. I only bring up therapy cause its been so helpful for me, I think a lot of people could benefit from just having someone to talk to. 

Congrats on kicking cancers ass. I'm a survivor too, but the easy kind. I has thyroid cancer that we caught early on.

7050,mig7ca9,1jdgeci,Oxy and morphine withdrawal,Snowblinded,That sounds awful. It might be helpful to remember that right now your brain has essentially stopped producing its own natural painkillers because its so used to getting so much of them from the pills. That's one of the reasons withdrawal is so bad. Not only are you missing the opiates pain killing effects but it also takes weeks/months for your body to start producing its own endorphins again so your double fucked. The good news is if you can find the strength to get through your body will start making its own endorphins again and you'll be in much less pain than you are now.,2,t1_mig61vi

As I said, good luck with this kick. I truly hope you leave it all behind for good! If you aren't able to, head to the clinic! There's literally no reason to suffer anymore.

It’s difficult because I’ve been through a lot in my life especially the last 8 years. 

If I’m answering your question correctly, I believe it’s something to do with my ADHD. I easily get addicted to things whether it’s substances a hobby or it seems I’m always chasing dopamine so I do things like cold showers ice baths sauna red light therapy I seem to be chasing dopamine still because I’ve not been officially diagnosed but I’ve done many of online assessments

 And it seems I have every trait of ADHD. 

Looking back at when I was doing the H and crack I feel literally ashamed of myself .

Some people say one can never say they would  never go back but I can honestly say I will never go back to H or whatever is the equivalent is nowadays because how tough the recovery process was. 

I live in an area where I don’t know that many people most of my childhood friends I grew up with was also users and died at a young age. 

I’m quite an extreme person kind of an all or nothing . One example the last time I quit the codeine I quit smoking cannabis at the same time which was quite rough to be honest but again nowhere near as rough as coming off the H and I was a lot younger then . sorry if that doesn’t answer your question but I’m happy to answer anything my friend",3,t1_mhps4kz

Every time I had a setback due to drugs, like getting fired from a job, I always made an excuse like ""I didnt want that job anyway.""

You just haven't hit your rock bottom yet. Even though you know you shouldn't be doing this, you still want to. Thats not rock bottom. And thats addiction. 

Rock bottom is the realization that you can no longer do this and you no longer want to. Hell, the no longer wanting to happened way before rock bottom for me. And you'll also do anything it takes to stop. 

Though, if youre 1 month clean, you probably have PAWS and life just sucks. PAWS, imo, is the hardest part of staying clean. It gets better with time but time moves very slowly during. Start an exercise routine, that helps more than you would think. And try mindfulness. 

Finally, stop the negative talk about yourself.

And the whole thing about the NA, I mean yeah hopefully you aren't going to meetings just to get other people to use as well. Honestly there is nothing anyone can do or say that can help you. You just have to have had enough and be ready to quit. Like I said it took me almost 10 years and wasted my whole 20s. I went to plenty of treatment centers, halfways, partial hospitalization, countless meetings and it wasn't till I really just couldn't do it anymore I finally took the steps to stop. As other people have said Suboxone MAT can help and it's the way I got 2 years. When you take subs u can't get high off other opiates if you try cause it blocks your receptors. Also helps with the withdrawal.

I have done almost all the MAT drug options methadone didn't really work for me and it was impossible to get off of, suboxone was alright but I didn't always take it correctly and it was hard to come off of, the one the worked the best and probably saved my life was the brixadi/buvidol 30 day shot. 

The shot was awesome because I didn't need to take something every day, it reduced cravings and helped me feel stable, it also blocks the effects of taking opiates, and it is much easier to come off of but you will experience some mild w/d. There are a ton of MAT options that will help you a lot with cravings and they all have pros and cons you need to consider for your situation. 

Honestly though, the *most* important part is doing the mental work. I didn't like meeting either and they can be anti all medications even ones that really help, what worked for me was doing an out patient program that included one on one counseling and some groups. It worked for me because they had full time and part time options so I could still go to work and because I really took the counseling serious because I wanted to get past it really badly.

Sick of feeling withdrawal kick in after 12 hours every day if I happened to have a day of less pain and opted to take less medication. I too prayed and prayed for God’s help getting completely off of Norco. I finally got Kaiser insurance after 10 years of no insurance and paying cash for everything.

Just FYI, NA books mean literally nothing medically speaking. So NA books saying that using pain meds for pain management isn't a relapse means *absolutely* nothing to doctors and /or Healthcare workers.

That being said, there are *actual* medical texts written by *actual* doctors and healthcare workers, that highly recommend that an addict in recovery or in MAT be given the same pain management that someone not in MAT would be given. Those medical texts are going to help you a lot more than telling a doctor what the NA handbook says, which many doctors will likely laugh at (to themselves) and ignore, and honestly rightfully so. Because again, AA and NA books are not medical texts. They are built on religion (regardless of how many times members try to claim a ""higher power"" doesn't have to be religious), and they should absolutely *not* be listened to by doctors.",2,t1_n30zpun

When i quit using subs, and then dropped down to 2mg a day within a week or so, i felt 100% fine back to normal.  
Bear in mind, my vitamin and supplement routine is rigorous and strict however. Probiotic for gut health, Vitamins, Amino Acids, Agmatine, DLPA, Fish Oil, Curcumin, high dose vitamin c. NAC + glycine. Dexamph for ADHD. Clonaz if I am ever overly anxious. Positive attitude. Heavy weights and exercise daily. I would say that drastically sped up my recovery. I also am on TRT for testosterone depletion due to my usage. So i have literally covered all bases. 

I would go get your testosterone checked, if its low, TRT could fix everything. Then go search on here for the supplement lists people recommend and start from there. At least use what i suggested above. If you still feel different then check back in. 

I feel if people really want to put the effort into feeling better after opiate usage you can recovery very quickly doing the right things.

The worst part about coming off after having been on for so long is that you get ""autonomic dysregulation"". All your ""at rest"" baseline biochemicals levels get skewed, so you go looking for that crutch. What I hate most is that while I'm sitting around doing nothing, my resting heart rate begins to go up to an uncomfortable level. Now this sounds dumb, but I can ""exercise it off"", which I inevitably end up doing several times a day, so that my fucked-up heart baseline rides the exercise come-down. Stays down maybe five hours. Then creeps up again doing nothing. I was never like this before opiods. Something about β-adrenergic receptors.

It's that and the piss-poor mental attitude it sends me into. I'd be arguing imaginary arguments with relatives and shit all in my head, getting worked up about it for no reason. Lose focus, can't concentrate, reach for the chill pill. All better now. Fuck, I'm on again.

Thanks for reading, I'll just paste some technical mumbo I dug up (ChatGPT). **TLDR** it's just what I said up there:

""...*Is there such a condition where a person's resting heart rate is unusually high but begins to normalize after exercise... only to go back high again after prolonged rest? I'm wondering if people recovering from opiate addition experience this, if β-adrenergic receptors are implicated*.""

""ChatGPT said: Yes, this pattern can occur, and it's not only plausible but also pathophysiologically consistent with the state of autonomic dysregulation, especially during early to intermediate recovery from opioid dependence. The phenomenon you've described—elevated resting heart rate (tachycardia) that attenuates with exercise and then rebounds during prolonged rest—can be attributed to several interrelated mechanisms. β-adrenergic receptors are indeed central actors in this. Likely Mechanism System Role in the Pattern Autonomic Nervous System Chronic opioid use downregulates parasympathetic tone and desensitizes adrenergic receptors. Upon withdrawal, there's sympathetic overdrive, leading to tachycardia at rest. β-Adrenergic Receptors During opioid use, there's compensatory β-receptor upregulation due to suppressed norepinephrine release. In withdrawal, receptor hypersensitivity causes exaggerated sympathetic responses to baseline stimuli. Exercise transiently ""uses up"" some of the norepinephrine/adrenaline, which can temporarily reduce HR post-activity. Baroreflex and Vagal Tone Blunted during opioid withdrawal; this delays parasympathetic reassertion post-exercise or rest, allowing HR to rise again once the transient sympathetic ""burn-off"" wears off. Cortisol/Catecholamine Axis Elevated baseline cortisol and norepinephrine levels are common during protracted withdrawal, sustaining high resting HR. Exercise briefly normalizes this axis via feedback mechanisms.""

I also was a substance teacher for a few years.  Drugs “hijack” your brain, your body fights back to downers with adrenaline, cortisol, etc. to get back you your homeostasis.  Uppers will make your body fight back by trying to bring you down.  Drugs also require your brain chemistry and receptors and neural pathways change.  I have the books somewhere in my medical book box I haven’t unpacked since my move, but it’s all about changes to the brain, some permanent, but healing is possible and takes some time.   Once you’ve been an addict your brain scans look very different than people who take no drugs.  “The Pathway to Pleasure” may be the name of the book.  

I still take pain meds when I need or have some light beers, or take Xanax for bad anxiety.    So maybe imma hypocrite.  But I try to keep a healthy fear and respect for meds.  Given my past I know it is worse each time and kindling can cause it.  

Morphine doesn’t work on me at all and never has, Vicodin helps a little, but I can’t sleep on it, Percocet works better for pain and doesn’t make me hyper or not sleep, etc.   genetic testing is a great idea because after an unknowable psych kept making me try all different anti-depressants and accuses me of lying, I took a genetic test.

I'll probably get hate for this but I despise Pharma and will do anything to avoid taking Rx meds.  About 10 years ago I came across a post about SAM-e, an amino acid that states it is for mood, joints and liver support.  I gave it a shot.  Holy shit if my depression wasn't GONE in about 4 days.  Since then, I have spent more hours than I can count trying to figure out how a freaking vitamin (actually amino acid) sold OTC literally took away debilitating depression.  I know I sound like a quack so I highly encourage you to look up SAM-e on Amazon and read the reviews.  First, notice how no matter what brand, 99% of them have over 4 star ratings.  I have since learned why it works for me.  In a nutshell, 30-40% of the population have a gene mutation.  It is this group that responds so incredibly well to SAM-e.  The best part is how quickly it works.  If you take it for one week and don't feel substantially better, it's probably not going to work. The way that I take it is as follows: load the system until you feel it working then lower the dose.  I take 800mg in the morning (studies show doses up to 1600mg/day are safe) and 800mg at night.  The way I describe it is don't expect euphoria, energy, anything like that.  There is a black cloud over my head and 3-4 days of SAM-e and that black cloud is no longer overhead.",1,t1_n2wg2b0

Once you get there, be brutally honest with yourself and with your counselor. If they offer it, look into trauma therapy; even if you don’t have a history of typical trauma, my counselor explained to us that the cycle and lifestyle that use often begets is traumatizing in itself, which made a lot of sense to me. 

Try to stick with people who seem serious about their recovery and pay no mind to those who don’t. There will likely be very few of the former and a whole bunch of the latter. 

If you attend group therapy, and something triggers you or makes you wildly uncomfortable, the group setting is the perfect place to process those feelings! I’ve seen a lot of people run out of groups because they had uncomfortable memories or feelings and not sit through them, which just keeps the cycle of running from our feelings going.

I took OC 80s for years without getting hooked.... and then graduated to heroin, which completely sucked my soul from my body...shot heroin for 10 solid years...not too many breaks either. 

Im clean 7+ years now. The only thing that saved me was going to prison for 5 years. My reward center in my brain is still FUCKED....opiates robbed me of pleasure from any other source. Its tough but I find it in small amounts elsewhere nowadays. The only thing thats going to make you feel better and closer to ""normal"" is more time being clean. There is no solution to recovering other than being sober for even just another day...put those days together and you will slowly feel yourself coming out of that hole youve dug.

The negative disassociated shittiness does pass and then you get flooded with all the emotions you were using to suppress. But it is worth it at the end of the day. Think of your pets, friends and family when you're in that dark spot of ""I don't mind if I die, it'll be peaceful"" because it won't be for them. 

And moreover, you might be surprised at how not peaceful it can be. You might indeed die in your sleep. Or you might get the OD where you start vomiting so much you give yourself a hiatal hernia and then pass out cause your vomiting so much you can't breath.. then either choke on your vomit or get it in your lungs which is heeelll. There's more than one way to OD is all I'm sayi f here.

You can do it. You've made it this far and the feelings you have will pass. 

Question: what stimulants are you using and are they prescribed ADHD meds or illicit? Because if it's the latter especially there's a great chance they're making the anxiety 50x worse honestly.

7369,mj6xz0x,1jhd5r7,How can I quit this drug use cycle. Need help pls,Lopsided_Bat_904,"I’m a former daily IV heroin, with the occasional IV coke habit user, and I think I’ve done pretty well, I’ll detail my experience. First, I went to rehab for four weeks, where I was put on 12 mg of Suboxone maintenance. I stayed on that for the first two years, then started to very slowly decrease my dose, taking off a sliver at a time. I’m currently at 3 mg daily nine years later, and now I’m about to talk to my doctor about starting the weekly buprenorphine injections. It’s far easier to taper off with the injections because of the extended half-life, some people only get one injection and then they’re done, withdrawal-free. 

And those first two years on maintenance, the goal is to build a normal life, build healthy habits, figure out your character flaws, what specifically brought you to addiction, and work through those/fix them. Those first two years are when I made the most changes, I became a completely different person, someone I’m proud to be now. The next seven years involve a lot of the same, but were much less significant character flaws. In those first two years, I went to weekly NA meetings, but never really stuck to it or did the steps, I made my own path and my recovery journey. Also, staying involved in the recovery community is HUGE, I don’t think I would’ve been able to do it without that aspect. After a year in recovery, I started working for a local recovery center, and have been involved on and off ever since. That’s been a massive help to keeping me on the right trajectory.

I know it’s controversial but they started me out on such a high dose that I had zero cravings. Zero cuz my entire body or system wanting opiates was dead. But it worked. I stayed on 2 strips for a year. Once I had my life back together I, without docs knowledge cuz they will cut your supply, weaned myself way down. I went down to one strip. Half in the am and half in the pm. Around the 5 day I would need a little more, which makes sense use subs stay in ur body forever. So I took an extra quarter when needed. I stayed on that for 9 months. This is what worked for me. And what is working for me now. So anyways after 9 months I was down to 1 strip a day. And there were days where I’d take 2 strips but not a day that I took heroin. Not a single day. So I stayed at 1 strip for a long time then cut my doesage by a quarter. That was hard. But if I faltered I had the extras from my script that I could take. But man… knowing I wasn’t going to use heroin and my life was good dude so good. I was finally feeling emotion and was proud of myself. So I don’t give a damn bout anyone saying mat is bad. It’s not. I’m still on half a sub a day. I get the full script and I just put them away in case the state goes cold Turkey. 

It’s there, it’s waiting for you. It’s okay if you don’t stay sober but it’s a start. And maybe it will work. I hope it does. It’s going to take years to feel normal but you’ll be raw and alive.

With any recent relapses (last 1-2 years), I would do what I call a “relapse postmortem.” Basically an exercise to take as much information as possible from each event, then use that data to identify patterns, triggering emotion, and, most importantly disruption points — opportunities to disrupt the cycle.

My mom used to tell me this and I did not believe her.  I'm now 52 and can tell you It's true.  I'd give my right arm to go back and know this. I was on pain pills for many years. I got on methadone and was taking 300 mg a day. It was horrible.  I traded that for suboxone for SIXTEEN years, and after lots of tragedies. I  Ditched subs for sublocade shot, and that is where I am.  Please know it's ok. And you aren't using. So that makes it more than ok. Take your time.  I know you have to work.  Do the best you can.

I remember being 20 fully immersed into drugs. Opiates dug it's claws into me worse than anything I had previously experienced.

I spent 2 years on poppy seed tea / opium while trying to get off for most of that time.  Never happened. Went to the doctor for help and the only thing that was offered was Suboxone. Got stuck on that for another 2 years while consistently trying to taper off. 

When opiate dependency has changed the brain pathways then Tapering off is such a challenge, it's moderately intense discomfort for months and years on end. It's absolutely fucking gnarly and feels never ending. Im not sure if your brain is in this position yet or not as your use hasn't been very long.... But the zenes are extra bad WD, so Iv  heard.

I literally could not stop taking opiates long term by myself. It felt impossible. Suboxone made me feel like a prisoner. 

Ibogaine treatment changed EVERYTHING and stopped cravings and withdrawals enough that I was able to heal and abstain. 
 

I am now 30 and have been clean for over 10 months now and it is all because I made a very difficult decision to go to treatment and take Ibogaine.",1,t3_1jhd5r7

Like how is it possible that i don't get euphoria from heroin but almost everyone else does, not that i am envy. Cant even imagine how 10 years must be, i only did it twice each about a month long.

Every time i  woke up early in a sweat and the first thing i reached for was a fucking crack pipe because (I smoked it) it's fucking sad. Paranoid that the police are searching my place. And then this those horrible withdrawals , for 1 week I could sleep maybe 5 hours in total. Working on 10% energy, aching all over and super sick. And that was just 1 month what about 2 or 3 or a year, i don't even want to imagine that.

But despite all that, after a few days from withdrawals my brain says hey, I really need that again. Its so hard for me to stay clean, fucking mad respect for doing it 7+ years long.

The problem I see is everyone says that getting clean will make you unltimately happier, but that only works if you fix your life too right? But how the hell am I supposed to do both?

I've only stopped twice after taking it for about a month because I ran out.

After withdrawals I can stay away from taking getting it again, but i feel like one wrong day and everything repeats, plus I've taken other drugs so I don't know it doesn't feel successful at all. I don't take my health for granted, in fact I'm quite scared of what will happen if I don't stop.

Can't really comment on how peaceful or not an OD really is. I've only experienced it once. I apparently smoked a couple mg too much, I don't remember that part. It just all went black for me.

I went outside in the middle of winter and gasped for air. I don't even want to know what damage I did to my brain that day. 

All the stimulants i used are illicit, mostly amphetamine sometimes meth. Do you mean they make the anxiety worse after the high is over or while the  high? Its really the only thing that helped me with social anxiety without being obvious. I really can't hide opioid consumption impossible for me.

Are you noticing how they can exacerbate a lot of the opiate withdrawal mental symptoms like irritability or ability to obsess over someone who wronged your or just one off as way too intense? 

Is street amphetamine or like dexie and ritalin. 

I've been prescribed dexies recently and they got me keen to kick bupe. Then the dickhead bupe doctors lied to me about this ""one and done"" shot and left me in extremely protracted withdrawl as a crashed tapered down to 50-75% off my normal dose of 8mg. Then it's gonna do it again in a few weeks. I could've just tapered down myself using strips. 

But Ive had literally 2-3 days without sleeo then get one night sleep, and this still happens if I dont take my dexies. 

But if I do I find they help get you functioning, but I kinda needed them for that before and this led to going up to my full dose. I've noticed it makes me act on agaitation more and stuff. 

I know meth is fucking awful during withdrawals once the high wears off from experience ahaha. I get bad anxiety naturally and meth comedown plus dope sickness or PAWs was just panic attacks and anxiety.

I’m not afraid at all this time though because the support you get from anyone and everyone for making the initial step to be there is more astounding than you could ever imagine before you’ve gone. Heck, I’m proud of you for considering it and I’m a stranger! 

The best advice I was given that I’ll pass on is that you aren’t there for anyone’s recovery except your own. Your social anxiety will probably be an advantage to you in this case! It’ll keep you away from the drama. Another thing that helps me is remembering that emotions aren’t good or bad necessarily, but they are valid. Each and every one of them is valid and worth experiencing. Embrace the discomfort because it means you’re doing it! It’ll fade as you learn to recognize where it’s coming from and why you’re feeling the way you are.

I am a lifelong opiate slave and nearly all around drug fanatic. thats one way of saying things. my name is eric, I am a lifelong opiate addict.  I am 18 months into a methadone program and clean from all other drugs other than cannabis..  For the same amount of time I have managed a very thorough job of cutting ties with any relationships outside of my mother, father and brother. 

I am only beginning to cruise around Reddit again. I have a phone and a desktop for the first time in several years after living a life of very few material possessions other than a backpack and my gear. 

at times when confronting the computer while feeling lonely yet overwhelming unsure of myself; I have doubted whether I am using the correct platform for what I am searching for (referring to reddit as a whole here)... I am looking for a place where I can be totally honest with a group of people who have been through similar repeated failures at life.  I have had ample financial support from family...( in my case my father) for every agonizing, embarrassing, and shameful moment of it. Chose the under the bridge life for a very long time. I actually expected to die that way, and to die early. 

I am the only one in my family that is uneducated by a university ..a failure and thus a complete embarrassment. I have never truly decided whether I am a product of an actual mental incapacity or whether it is a product of me early on feigning certain problems to get medications from an early age. I saw a lot of psychiatrists. 

a lot of this ... i just dont have the balls to talk to anyone in my family about because they all just assume I am a drug addled lost cause by now... I am 38 and went into a fantastically expensive rehab the first time around when I was 17... and many, many more rehabs, detoxes from 30 days to 90 days to sober livings in california, and everything inbetween over the following 20 years.. I was always using and being clean at the same time if you know what I mean. Clean date remarkably never changed, haha! i know thats not actually funny. 

I have somehow managed to ""post"" incorrectly... a few times.... and ended up with some people informing me I was breaking rules somehow... or posting in an incorrect place... and never gave any further instructions on where to go... or gave examples of how it should have looked before commenting... I felt terrible.. stupid... and even more lonely than ever

  
i would love to give and receive some input from a community... I guess I just need a little help, and would love to be able to DM somebody who does know the ins and outs of ""reddit etiquette"" , when this  occurs so I dont feel like such an idiot that it sends me off to where I wont communicate with anyone outside of my immediate family... a



the isolation from normal conversations seems to be having a detrimental effect on my psyche..

  
I am also a full time caretaker for my mother, who was paralyzed from brain cancer 13 years ago.... I replaced the live in caretaker that was helping my father when I finally decided to leave a dilapidated-trailer -shooting -gallery I was living...or dying in... depending on how you look at it. 

  
if anyone made it through all that, and wants to help... when i have a question as to how to properly become an active member, rather than a lurker... 



you'll be a friend of mine for life.

I’ve literally had patients tell me they told them it would be a few days so they began calling around other programs and 2 hrs later they called back saying a bed had opened up. depending on time of day they may want you to come in later on, or the next day. sometimes a program will call and say you need to come in now, some people can’t do that bc they need to get their affairs in order first, they’ll say you can’t drive yourself in and they’ll pick you up..  but a lot of times when you finish they won’t give you a ride home, or if they do it’s a long process.. just make sure you ask all of that stuff, have your affairs in order and make sure it’s a good program",1,t1_mgdz0ak

I am eating properly, I am sleeping normally, I am more present. Subs can be a great tool for those that need it but precip withdrawal is absolutely real and can happen. I am not a Dr so please don't take this as medical advice but there is a bunch of helpful info in this community with many others sharing their stories. I am not sure of the exact amount of time but from what I've read you need to wait at least 24 hours and be in withdrawal before you introduce the sub and start at a low dose and see how you feel. But if this is something you really wanna do it might be worth consulting your Dr first. Also just make sure you do your own research on subs as well. For me personally it wasn't worth it to switch to subs from a low dose of norco. My end goal was not being dependent on any sort of med like that, that's why I did it the way I did. But everyone is different. I hope this was helpful. Feel free to message me if you wanna talk or need support etc!",1,t1_mi7c8ds

I bounced back between sobriety and relapse for a decade, and would cold turkey every time. It was horrible for a few days, lingered for a few weeks, then id think ""oh that was easy, I could handle that again"" then fuck up all over again. 


Tapering gives your body time to adjust in a healthy way, but also your mind time to process how stupid addiction really is and what led you there, and why you'll never do it again. While thats happening your bodily functions are slowly recalibrating and working on finding a balance. 


The main problem with goin cold turkey imo is its so intense, that once you get through the acute phase, you forget all about PAWS. You think ""if i got through that, I can get through anything"" then when PAWS creeps up, its so subtle in comparison to the acute phase of cold turkey, that you'll probably assume something in your life is wrong rather than realizing your still healing and will be for a while. 


At least thats what would happen to me, id start thinking, ""i got through withdrawl, and life just wont give me a break, fuck it ill just get high"" but the reality is that it wasnt the outside world that was the problem, it was that I was still recovering and pretty much in denial about it, leading me to take on more than I could handle in life, all predicated on a brain still healing yet isn't aware of that fact. ",1,t1_nlbhqte

It's best to start megadosing Liposomal Vitamin C 3 days prior to quitting or tapering down.

I also take DLPA, NAC, Agmatine Sulfate and Magnesium Bisglycinate, which helps a lot with withdrawals and PAWS.

also, on another note - what a lot of ppl (non drug users, mostly) fail to realize, is that trump ""banning fentanyl"" is actually horrible news, because it's just going to increase the amount tranq being used to cut the supply. there will always be something ""better"" and ""stronger"" - i imagine it probably is very hard to keep up with. especially when you're in a hot spot like kensington and there are a trillion different stamps floating around. that's a lot of product to test. and what's in a bag one day may not be the same the next. so i guess it's pretty difficult to keep track. idk.",14,t3_1nwo4ei

The link between them is not conclusive, and while it is a condition could kill someone, just glancing at some medical literature I haven't found any instances in which it did. 


[This paper](https://gmr.scholasticahq.com/article/31500-the-connection-between-opioid-withdrawal-and-takotsubo-cardiomyopathy-case-reports-of-opioid-octopus-heart) concludes:


>Twelve similar cases have been reported in the literature, suggesting that opioid withdrawal may be associated with development of TCM. Further quantitative research is required to establish this relationship. Our findings contribute to the theoretical pathophysiology of TCM and offer important considerations for clinical management of opioid withdrawal.


Good that they're continuing to study it I guess. I'm not trying to scare anyone. If WD was the cause it's still exceedingly rare, and it's far more likely that someone in WD would die from complications of vomiting and diarrhea. But apparently it can happen. Every death is a tragedy, and in a more ideal world every withdrawal would be monitored by a doctor. But like, anything can kill you.

it's more nuanced than ""well it isn't the withdrawal itself, it's just all the side effects caused by the withdrawal"". it is ""it isn't the withdrawal itself, it's one side effect when the pt doesn't have agency to self-treat it"". 

there has to be a more direct and unavoidable connection between withdrawal and death for us to say ""withdrawal causes death"". people in withdrawal who can't cope with feeling their emotions kill themselves. people in withdrawal whose executive function is impaired get hit by a vehicle while crossing the street. neither of these people would have died if not for withdrawal, but that's not sufficiently proximate cause to say ""withdrawal causes death"".",7,t1_nhhtymb

Getting out of your own way and actually wanting to change, make your life better is the first step and a lot of the time the hardest. 

I was like you - OD'd at least a dozen times. Heart stopped on 3 of them...I had a guardian angel out there because multiple times I was tucked away in the back of a parking lot and someone saw me in the car passed out and called 911. If I had tinted windows I'd be dead. Its an absolute miracle im alive and for a long time I thought I was invincible as well.  10 years as an IV Heroin user. Hooked on oxy 80s before that. 

Im fucking free now. Have been for 8 years as of july 17th. Got married, built a house, have an amazing life w/ my wife...Im grateful for every damn day I have now as all this time I have now is bonus time as far as Im concerned. Shouldnt even be here. But I wanted more, I wanted something besides being a slave to opioids. 

  
Anyone out there wondering if there is hope. THERE IS. Its not easy in the beginning but life takes twists and turns and before you know it you'll be looking back and calling yourself a dumbass for not getting clean sooner.

I feel the best I ever have now at 38 years old. I'm healthier than I ever have been and have SOOO much to live for that I spent the last 4 years building ( I did my first 4 years clean in prison).

You have spoken about being depressed and not wanting to be alive. Its not surprising that you would want to use, and if thats the only coping mechanism you have, youre gonna use. 

I think you would benefit from finding a new way to handle your mental health issues. I dont know what youre doing on that front, but if its not working, try the next thing that could help. For many of us, the work we do on our mental health is what allows us sobriety.  Working with therapists, counselors,  psychiatrists, taking psyciatric medications are integral to recovery for many people. 

If you can work on the reason that you use, you wont need to use any more. Thats my experience anyway. Not using any more, everything about the drugs in general, are just a tiny part of a sucessful recovery.",4,t3_1mtttss

This year I tried to quit almost every month but started again because I needed to buy or otherwise the guy wouldnt get a new script.

“You know the cool thing about withdrawals? It’s that you don’t ever have to feel them again unless you choose to.” Same goes for the possibly PAWS you may be dealing with. If you choose to relapse then you start all over again when you’ll be over this hump soon rather than starting all over back at day one.

However, Wellbutrin did me wonders for my severe depression and suicidal thoughts. It is also used to help some people fight addictions like food or cigarettes etc. and for some, it gives a bit of energy once it’s been in your system for a few weeks. So maybe if you’re able to, mention to your doctor that you’d like to try an antidepressant? I’ve just always heard a lot of recovering addicts say Wellbutrin is the best, but if it isn’t for you…don’t give up. Keep trying until you find the right med for you (if you even want that option.)

It’s very controlled and majority of people aren’t there or being sober by choice. I can tell you first hand because I’ve gone through it I was on drug court for 4 years stayed sober whole time because I was scared of getting locked up and being on it for even longer but same day I completed the program I went out and got high. I didn’t wanna stop getting high I just got forced to. Same with all the rehabs I’ve been too I got forced to go and got high when I got back.

7668,mzdg4rf,1ld7x97,100 days clean and I'm miserable,yippekyay,"Just my opinion- but you’re not really even sober yet… you can do it any way you want to and I know some people (one) who have done smart recovery and been successful. They might not be addicts like me. Or you. I think there are all different kinds of addicts and level of addictions. 

But .. my experience is that I need to get off all mind and mood altering drugs. And I’m not really even sober yet till I have. You have to be sober to do the steps. The steps is the medicine - the treatment for the disease of addiction. The steps are designed to treat that area in your brain that is being filled with drugs or mind or mood altering substances so it is essential it’s raw and open and starving when we do the steps.. 

This makes your Journey way harder and more difficult. 

But it also gives you these wonderful things like desperation - which drives you to reach out and connect with others ( that we have to do. We cannot do this alone. ) - and humility, which allows you to do the steps and confess the reality of who you are and what has made you, you and willingness, which allows us to follow the steps as they’re outlined till the end and listen to our sponsors. 

The 12 step programs are all based on one program. The program that is and has been the most successful at getting addicts clean. The problem is not a whole lot of people even do the program as it is outlined to do it. They aren’t really sober and aren’t really doing any steps. So it’s the blind leading the blind. Lots of relapse, lots of bullshit. 

Plus you’re in a room with really really sick people. So lots of drama, lots of bullshit and you have to stick around and learn how to deal with it. Without relapsing . Being sober and alive has to be the most important thing. Being popular ? Can’t be. 

That 12 step program, if you read the literature ? 

The point to the steps is to have a spiritual experience - because it’s the spiritual experience that is supposed to change you- because we are beyond redemption, beyond change. Because nothing we can do can actually change / heal us- 

So the steps are the actual medicine we need- they’re designed perfectly to address the disease of addiction when you do them the way they’re supposed to be done. 

The principles are a companion to the 12 steps- each principle representing a spiritual law/ virtue. 

For example the first step the principle is honesty. We start to see us through our actions- not our feeling or intent. We see what we did. Just what we did. And those actions prove to us that nothing in the world will make us stop using. Nothing - doesn’t matter how much we lose, how much we hurt or hurt others - we won’t stop because we can’t stop. 

The honesty is is realizing that we cannot stop. And seeing all the lies we have told ourselves over and over again to continue to use; just weed, just on weekends, just at night, etc just alcohol- the list goes and on. 

So I have some suggestions. If you really want to experience freedom and .. have a life beyond what you can imagine - a life of love, friendship , happiness, joy, pain, a life that you remember and a life you’re not miserable in. 

First ? Off of everything. You will never learn how to be sober unless you actually teach yourself how to be. Can’t sleep? Pray or meditate. Go on a jog. Write. Whatever. 

Next? Pick three meetings a week you go to consistently without fail. You need a support group. You need to become accountable to people. You need friends. You need to be missed. You need to raise your hand and share - and get honest about how you’re feeling. 

I know it seems really scary and frightening but we have all been there. Sharing allows people to come up to you and exchange numbers and all the sudden you’re not alone anymore. 

Next? You need to find a sponsor - don’t go for what is cool.. or hip, slick and sick. 

Go for someone that says something you never thought. Go for someone who has done the steps. Go for someone you’re slightly intimidated by ( that’s hard for men) go for someone that will attack your ego not preserve it. 

Go for someone who is honest. 

Pick up a commitment. At one of these meetings. 


Go to a meeting a day. More if you need it. 

When you wake up in the am?!
I want you to spend five minutes meditating. I want you to pray- to become willing to be hurt, willing to be scared. Willing to face your fear. Pray to keep you sober. Doesn’t matter if you don’t believe in god. Do you believe that there might be a power in this universe that … is beyond what you can understand - just the possibility is enough. That’s all you need to do the steps. 

And do that and see how you feel. 

Don’t be afraid to be a mess, to be scared or hopeless. Share. Open up. Reach out. 

Let people love you till you can love yourself. 

We have all been there. You’re not alone.",1,t1_myab0ov

I dont agree with ""suboxone isnt sober"" because you do really function much more rationally on it than you would on the come up come down cycle of short term opioid abuse, but it isnt ""clean"" for your brain.

Suboxone has caused lots of anhedonia for people especially after months of consecutive use, along with low energy and libidom. Just look on their sub, its probably the number one reason why people quit. Why not take something for life if it:

1. Prevents relapse 
2. Keeps you out of withdrawal

I was born again when I come out of my coma for example I know my mum is my mum but feeling wise she's just an older woman I know, I like her and we are good friends but there is no mother son connection there, she knows this but understands, I only actually care and have a familiar love who feels natural and the memories come with the good emotions on reminiscing is my grandmother, those memories feel like mine and not some implanted memory.


I can only keep myself alive by still taking Opioids and BZDs, I, my ego was born already dependant on the it's normal, if I have to do even a few days in BZD WD I will finish myself and no doctors will listen to me that not having them in my brain because I was born with them both a natural part of my brain taking them away is like giving me a lobotomy an the only way it can be managed is with high doses of anti psychotics I'm just A catatonic dribbling mess unable to move or have a thought. 


Now I semi care for my grandmother and live with her but every month she's getting weaker and has had a few falls recently. I lie to my mother about getting a job and moving on with life because she doesn't understand this is me now and there's no way I could work again with my memory and violet outbursts (I've got a sever hypoxic brain injury) nobody understands. They might say ""oh I preferred you when you was like ect"" I try to tell them that the person they are thinking about is dead he's gone and I don't know why they don't understand. There's children but they are not mine and I don't have any feelings towards them, they are just any other child off the street which I happen to be the father of. I don't care about what they do or who you are there not ""my children"" even though I look quite healthy and fit I'm not, if I have to vacuum the house afterwards I will lie down and fall asleep fully normally for around 90 mins to 2 hours and it's not a nap I'm in a full on deep and for the rest of the day I feel ill and not right so I can't exercise anymore because if I do I will easily straight sleep for 24 hours or more.


The only thing keeping me alive is looking after my grandmother and after she passes I'm going back to where I should of been left, it's the only place I felt at peace, it's torture and I think sometimes am in hell now, they didn't shock me back to life they sent me to hell, the feeling I felt before my new birth was the most loving, peaceful it's hard to describe just pure positive energy and that's what I was, I want to go back I should of been left ther


So with the state of my health and being me now I'm going to go back shortly after my grandmother has passed and I won't be needed anymore and why should I suffer just because people will miss me but again they still don't get that person they are having memories about is all ready gone and has been for 5 years.


Anyway I'm going back there I just want to feel peaceful and where I should be anyway, I keep saying ""I"" but your not nothing you don't have a character or any idea of who you are and don't understand what things are it's just a strong emotion. 


I should really start to buy the things but I probably would use them to get high.


I will be using a highly concentrated IV of a huge heroin dose and shortly before that I will drink a few grams of a barbiturate any BZDs I have left over 2 packets of blood pressure tablets to stop my heart incase I'm just in a coma, although it will probably be the heroin that kills me through no O2 to my brain and just to be confident the oral stuff will be more than enough, I will probably use an auto injector and 10ml of very strong heroin and 2 25ml syringes of 2% propofol I will be unconscious within 10 seconds from clicking start. I will be where I should then.


Just using a lot of Heroin, alcoholic or BZDs will give you brain damage anyway ",1,t3_1k316zb

7717,mkj6cya,1jnb3eb,Should I tell my kids their Dad is an addict & active addiction,bitterberries,"I can’t tell you what you should do, but I can share a personal experience. My brother was an active opiate user. He had four kids, and during one of his overdoses, his oldest son was with him—outside the stall in a public washroom—when it happened. His son was aware enough to get my brother help. My brother survived that time because of his son's quick actions.


My nephew is one of the most empathetic, kind-hearted kids I’ve ever met. I often think about how differently that overdose experience could’ve gone if he hadn’t known what to do, or worse, had no idea what was even happening to his dad. If my brother hadn’t made it, the trauma of being helpless and confused would’ve been devastating for his son. 


The truth is, no matter how much we want to shield our kids, they know when something’s wrong. Your boys are old enough not only to know the truth but to need support for themselves. And they can’t access that help if they don’t understand what’s going on around them.


In my opinion, it's better for kids to be informed than kept in the dark—especially when the reality is that one day, they may need to act fast to save their parent’s life. Hiding something this serious might feel protective, but it can actually do more harm in the long run.",6,t3_1jnb3eb

If you do tell them, they’re gonna get what basically feels like an emotional gut punch. Hopefully they won’t cycle this behavior with their own lives. 

I would definitely put this in a professional’s hands and get their advice before doing anything, tbh. 

As for his addiction. Has he tried any maintenance meds? Like suboxone or methadone? Suboxone and similar is much easier to manage. He won’t be high as a kite but won’t be dealing with withdrawals either. He will be a lot better emotionally and physically. He will still be on something but it won’t get him high.

7732,mkkwox8,1jnb3eb,Should I tell my kids their Dad is an addict & active addiction,Inner_Researcher587,"Man, I wish things were different. I believe the problems that come with opioid use, revolve more around the stigma and economic/financial issues, rather than the actual drug use. 

You knew this man used, and you still fell in love with him. Then you had 2 children with him. It sounds like he has (somewhat) managed as a functional addict for many, many, years. Most addicts deal with severe physical/emotional pain, and cope with opioids. It's very well possible that he hides away in his room because of these feelings, along with the shame, guilt, and sadness he likely feels for letting you down. That's suffering right there. A pure living hell. 

I believe YOU could change that. You guys have been together a long ass time, and I bet he feels like an outsider. Try to accept him for who and what he is, and include him as much as possible. Give him a reason to do better. Be a family. Work towards a resolution to this problem, or possibly even acceptance of it. This disease is long-term, and can take the form of just about anything. Perhaps... be grateful that he's not an alcoholic, gambling, or sex addict. Or even a ""gamer"" lol. 

Obviously, a drug maintenance program will help as far as the stigma, and financial aspect comes in... but just know that's a substitution only. 

As far as telling your children about his use... I'd recommend NOT telling them at all. Kids are very impressionable at that age, and from my experience, may begin to use themselves. It's insane how many kids I've known who end up doing (xyz) substance, just to bond with a parent. Or, they may do something stupid - like steal his drugs to try on their own, contact his ""dealer"" and score, or begin to experiment with friends. Unfortunately, in today's world... that sort of ""coming of age"" thing, can be deadly. 

You two have hid it this long... why change now?

I apologize, that my opinion isn't in line with most of the ""recovery"" community. But I feel like this community doesn't REALLY have this thing figured out yet. I've seen essentially high priests of NA, with 20-40 years of ""clean time"" relapse, and die. One woman, who was basically in charge of my whole state NA programs... I found scoring with a high class dealer we both knew (from NA). She made me swear not to tell anyone that she had been using for a decade. Lol. Can you believe that? She became such an organized, functional addict, that she tricked shit-loads of doctors/cops/councilors into thinking she ""found god"" in NA or some shit. This was the same woman who ran the groups in the hospital detox I went to. A real ""hard ass"" lady, who told you how it is. All a fucking facade. Hell... I even befriended the grandson of the great ""Bob"" guy who started A.A. He's a crooked alcoholic pharmacist, who ran a whole warehouse weed grow (before it was legal). 

Anyway. Nothing is black and white. Find the gray and nestle in some more. Leave this man if you no longer love him. Otherwise, try to accept his faults, and love him for who he is. Actions speak louder than words, and if you constantly ""say"" things that bring him down, yet stay with him, he'll think that you love him unconditionally. And if you REALLY love him unconditionally, maybe stop ""saying"" those things. I bet he'll start coming out of his room more if that's the case. People CAN have an addiction, and learn to rule over it with their head held high. Confidence can go a long way.

I do believe that LOVE can shine through the darkness. There's no rule set in stone that says someone can't be a good lover and father while on drugs.

Just my opinion though, and I bet I'll get shit for this! Lol.",3,t3_1jnb3eb

Why it’s so important to tell them: 

First of all, they’re at a higher likelihood of developing a substance use disorder than many of their peers. They need to know this so they can be careful and protect themselves from repeating the cycle. 

Second, addiction is a disease. By being secretive about it, you perpetuate the belief that it is something shameful that needs to be hidden from others. This discourages open conversation and prevents people from seeking help when they need it. This also prevents your kids from seeking help when they need it. If they feel they can’t talk about what’s going on at home or if they don’t understand, they can’t cope.

At the very least, they know SOMETHING is wrong. At most, they have already found some stash and tasted it. Obviously, that's not something I'm claiming is likely, but it absolutely happens.

The best way to go about that would be to say the dad has some issues but it's nothing about them...if he's retarded and leaves his stash in the open...first I wonder why the fuck she's still with him as the kids could just die...but maybe mention substance but not what it actually is. I'm in recovery and I told my kid I need a very strong and dangerous medication for now (methadone) so he wouldn't sneek around and that did the trick. It's also hidden.

Telling someone : your dad is a heroin addict is like the worst thing to do. The older is prob gonna try and find the stash first depending on his personality...but given the family situation with possible traumas and shit I 100% would have (happened with weed for me).",3,t1_mkih4zg

Get into an Outpatient Program. I didn't do rehab, but I signed up for an Outpatient Program. You get what you put in. I went 4 days a week for 4 hours until I was down to 1 day at 2 hours.


I had a decade+ addiction and I never thought I could do a rehab/outpatient, but I forced myself to do it. I'm coming up on 4 years clean, without a single relapse, about 85% is because I had social interaction with people in outpatient.


I also did NA, but I didn't really follow the program. I just went to hang out and make friends. Sometimes I'd go to 5 meetings a day just to be around people.


Please sign up for an outpatient program and go to NA.",4,t3_1it7dly

Start with walks or ride a bike, etc. Some type of exercise helps/gets fluids flowing/helps rebuild the brain quicker. Other than that, you made it through the toughest of days.

Mentally speaking - i agree with many of the comments made here in this thread. it is important to keep your mind occupied with activity and the more physical activity that you can do - in my experience - the better.  Regardless of your religion, if you have a Bible or are an on-line reader, try starting your day in the book of Psalms.

Basically, this is the point where we need to learn how to make ourselves a new life thats sustainable without drugs. Its alot, and its new, and i found it to be pretty overwhelming. Of course new things always are. I also found it to be very freeing.
The awareness that it was new allowed me the freedom to try to be what i wanted to be now.

Check out if you want what LEF or luminous energy field.  I took the holistic,shamanic healing, dark night of the soul research and finding real healers to aid me in that direction.

7782,m5ounwn,1hujtgh,11 days clean today (update),Repulsive_Tiger_8008,"Can I ask what kind of workout you're performing? 

I totally agree with you about the essential role of exercise. Exercising to whatever capacity your body is able is probably the single most important thing that you can do to regenerate endorphins and heal the mu-opioid receptor system, thereby returning mind and body to a viable state. Exercise, particularly cardio exercise, also decreases the risk, intensity, and duration of Post Acute Withdrawal Symptoms (PAWS). I've found exercise that combines breath-work and movement, such as ashtanga yoga, to be more effective than just mindfulness meditation in terms of helping to center me, reducing withdrawal symptoms, and helping me to practice radical acceptance of where I'm at physically and mentally. 

Very proud of you! For real. Gives me inspiration for my own taper, which I've struggled with, to be honest. 

For anyone who is wondering about *why* I decided that I need to get off of methadone, I wrote [Metha-Don't](https://www.concreteconfessionalblog.com/post/metha-don-t) and [Sword of Damocles](https://www.concreteconfessionalblog.com/post/suboxone-and-methadone-maintenance-double-edged-sword-or-sword-of-damocles).

For anyone else who is tapering off, I've compiled my [tapering tips and tricks](https://www.concreteconfessionalblog.com/post/tapering-tips-and-techniques) and [at-home opioid withdrawal guide](https://www.concreteconfessionalblog.com/post/at-home-opioid-detox-the-essentials). They cover things like rescue doses and comfort meds, volumetric dosing and mindfulness meditation.

Once again, congratulations! You are giving yourself one of the most beautiful gifts in existence, which is what I call ""happiness without a half-life"" (patent pending, lol). It is nothing less than giving yourself the gift of the present moment.

Utter fucking knockout pills.
Daridorexant and the like.

Ultimately if you’ve been on sleep meds you’ve gonna have to endure some sleepless nights if you’re wanting to get off then. That’s just the deal.

If cannabis agrees with you - have some of that.

If doctors won’t give you Valium, ask for Daridorexant. There’s no abuse concern with that.
That and Mirtazapine have me at least able to rest (and I’ve been on Mirtazapine for ages - 7.5mg takes maybe two hours to kick in but knocks you the fuck out, but in a good , restful sleep way).

Then there is guanfacine which is also good.
Ironically I have boxes of Valium and don’t even use it because the Orexin antagonists work better.

It’s on the NHS in the UK as is Mirtazapine, and a wider variety are available in the US (although as a dual citizen I wouldn’t recommend taking drugs licensed in the US and not UK/EU).

Any doc will tell you that your body and mind will feel better when it’s gotten some good exercise in, and that’s bc they’re backed up by countless studies. And as an addict I’ve found that when one part of my health is bad, it can be a domino effect on the other aspects of my health. Example: I don’t get any exercise for a few days and I lay around eating junk -> I don’t go to sleep early enough due to not being tired enough -> my already challenging lifelong insomnia is triggered and sleep schedule is thrown off -> I don’t get the things done that I need to or the things I do get done are done poorly -> my depression is triggered bc I’m not getting shit done and I feel like I’m failing-> the addict part of my brain says hey man you know what would make you feel better if you had some, and you’d probably get all that stuff done that you’re behind on and even get ahead of some stuff -> that voice wins and I’m poisoning myself with the false belief that this one time is ok and will actually benefit me. I think that’s part of why it’s so hard to STAY clean, bc as lame as it sounds our brains are super fragile in early recovery and we’ve gotta be completely on top of taking care of all things that factor into our mental health. 

The mornings have always been real hard on me too and without that promise of a dopamine hit from my drug, or drugs,  of choice, getting out of bed is just plain harder when I’m not getting high. I think it’s the loss of that morning reward that makes the mornings more difficult when not using. I’ve been trying to go to the gym when I wake up to combat that, but it’s in a way easier for me to do that since I work 3rd shift and can usually wake up a couple hours before I go to work and get a work out in.

Do you think if you kept a pretty detailed sleep diary - which included food and water intake/exercise per day/anxiety etc. - your doctor may take you more seriously? 

I remember the torture of my last sober period, being so so so physically tired but wired. I felt like I could get to the point of winding down, but the minute I laid down in bed it was game over. 

Might sound mad, but I found trying to sleep in places which aren’t for sleeping actually helped. 
I’d drive somewhere rural and quiet and take a nap in my car, because it was so out of my normal routine of sleep I fell asleep pretty quickly and managed to get a few good hours. Same with sitting upright in a chair or sofa. You could give it a try and see how you get on? 

I also used to find I could fall asleep quicker if my environment was cold. I’d have my window wide open, the coldness would just sooth me for whatever reason.",5,t1_m4srtuf

Better do a quick taper with subs because for most people the WD from subs is like 10x worse, and instead of feeling like crap for a week it’s more like a month not sure if you knew that or not, just wanted to give you a heads up. A lot of people that have problems with 7oh just switch over to mit extract or kratom and it normally gets rid of most the WDs for them.",0,t1_m4sowbs
7872,m4vnpnb,1hqpxkw,Desperate for sleep,teopap91,"Regarding Mirtazapine, I use it too. I take just a 3-4mg piece of pill (pain in the asss using a pill cutter to cut a 30mg down to 3-4mg pieces) but less is more regarding to induce sleep. (For sleep, all doses under 15 mg work depending the tolerance)
IME, in a completely empty stomach, it takes from 30 mins up to 1,5 hrs to work. The kick in time varies & depends from each individual's body chemistry at the time of intake.
Some times, there are 20% chances ime to cause RLS so keep that in mind.

I  was using regularly Remeron to aid sleep, but since I started using HΗC, if not in intense WDs, it causes sleep at the end of its action

If this accident happened 15 years ago, my first instinct was to run to urgent care and hope they give me opiates.

What did I do instead? Self care, took most of the rest of the day off. Went home and took some Advil, iced it, elevated it and bandaged it up. Feels a bit better today.

I know that when I began my sobriety, I, too, felt extremely bored and time did feel like it was going very slow which also triggered some strong cravings to drink and use again due to the fact my days were full of nothingness compared to previously. 

Since I began to give myself more structured routines (morning and evening) with the option of things I could do throughout the day, it really helped to make that time speed up again because I was enjoying myself. 

So I highly recommend you take a look at your current routines to see what's serving you and what isn't. Then from there, work on creating some simple morning routines like waking up in-between a set time, having breakfast, journaling, doing 5-15 minutes of small exercise, etc. Then an evening routine to help you get ready for bed. 

Something I recommend to people is to create a list of things you'd like to do. This can be hobbies, games, seeing people, phoning people, etc. Write them all down and then every day, choose three to do that day. That way, you're keeping yourself busy, you have something planned for the day and you can do something you enjoy whilst keeping everyday fairly different!

Honestly this feeling was a big part of the reason I got on MAT, but even after getting stabilized on that it felt like my life was in slow motion somehow. I then came to the conclusion that sobriety itself wasn't really boring, it was peaceful; but my brain didn't know how to process peace anymore.     
     
Everything in my life had been an emergency in active addiction, or had to be at an emergency level before I could even recognize it as an issue. For years everything in my life was an extended emergency dedicated to me getting dope, and sobriety left me with so much time. It was like my brain was so used to solving the problem of getting dope that I didn't know how to process having all that extra time, so I began adding back in all the lifelong hobbies I used to do before addiction. Threw myself into work. I've rebuilt my life, I've lost 100lbs, and I stopped being bored.     
     
I went down a rabbit hole one night in early *sobriety, found a days alive calculator.

I signed up for a dmt study and a mdma study . Dmt im talking to now seems interesting . Mdma therapy (not abuse) can help if you work with someone to integrate . Same with lsd but dont do it alone in the state you are in . My two cents . Othern that if you can MAKE yourself get up and even do 5 pushups to start . Take a walk for a drink or smokes if you smoke (you should quit if you do ) . Get moving . I walk a lot . Helps me TREMENDOUSLY . Recently began running . But its taken me years to get to that . Meditation is AMAZING . Trancendental meditation . Its VERY simple and non religion based . Look into david lynch (the director ) he was super involved . Things like that are SO hard when feeling as you are but little steps can be the building blocks to bigger steps . It will take time and it will be challenging but you can do it.

Also, when your doing opiates you can sleep a whole fuck load more than you do when sober (in my experience at least) and that has a big part to play but also just the boredom that comes with being sober also makes time drag. And it’s not that being sober is that boring, it’s being sober after experiencing doing drugs because we fucked up our brains and are basically incapable of producing natural happiness (dopamine).

8074,nfp8ace,1no41j4,What gets you through the day not using?,problyurdad_,"Couple things.     
      
First? Tacos. Why tacos? Because I am amazing and I got clean so instead of getting high I reward myself with tacos when I think about drugs.       
       
Because…….      
     
The feeling I am chasing no longer exists. I am 42 now and I got high for the first time in 08. Before everything was fentanyl. I got clean in 2019, and that high at the end of my addiction was wildly different than what I was looking for, and used to. Old school dope used to just chill you out, make you feel warm and safe, secure, and happy. But this fent bullshit makes you act a fucking fool and a half. Almost like how meth makes people act.      
       
I used to be able to get high and sleep like a baby.  Fent? Wired me like caffeine. My skin breaks out and I get super itchy. My nose runs, and worst of all, I puke my guts out on it. One time, I wasn’t even high, I was on my way to get dope from my dealer, and I had to pull over and vomit because of simply anticipating the feeling that was coming, my body reacted to it. I never had that on Percocet, or heroin in those heydays. Plus the withdrawals are an absolute fucking hell. I used to be able to go to work when dope sick but this stuff on the streets now is way worse, I can’t sleep or leave my bed, eat, drink, nothing for 2 weeks or more. I can’t afford to waste any more time on that.        
     
I have a family now, and I couldn’t imagine acting how I acted on fent in front of them.           
      
So tacos, and knowing that they don’t sell my brand anymore. It’s been discontinued.",18,t3_1no41j4

Fent didn’t do that to me at all, only reason I did it was bc I was so scared to WD and was super addicted.

Also magnesium and potassium help. 

idk how long youve been on morphine or how much you take but it's possible that your withdrawal will only really be three days of acute wd, followed by a week of symptoms coming and going feeling less sick each day. After a month you should feel much better. You got this!! ❤️

Suboxone will definitely help (whenever I was stabilizing on subs if I started feeling the RLS in my shoulders I knew I needed to take another small piece)

 Always use the smallest dose of subs possible, it has a really long half life. back when I would only use heroin for a few weeks at a time I would take one dose of Suboxone 24hr into wd and it would keep me well for a few days, naturally tapering off until I had no opiates in my system and minor or no withdrawal symptoms!",5,t3_1lzhkng

Then opiate withdrawal made it a million times worse. But even being clean doesn’t make it go away completely, for me at least. I take a daily supplement of magnesium with calcium and potassium which helps. And my GP gave me a low dose script (100mg to 200mg) of gabapentin just to take a few hours before bed.

I'd really love to be off all opioids too but above that, I want to have my life back and be able to be a mom to my son and work towards being able to support us without any big help from family. And to do that, I need to not have cravings. Suboxone has made that possible for me. Just letting you know it has worked for me and I'd rather be on suboxone than any of the alternatives. Yes, someday I'll come off of it. But I was getting high for decades. I think it's reasonable to expect that I can use the help of suboxone until I have totally settled into a life that works for me, which is taking time to build after decades of drug use and addiction. 

Also, if you're not taking a multivitamin, start there. And get good ones, not just the cheapest one you can find. There's a few reasons for this which I'll explain if you care to know. Also there are supplements than can help. Magnesium being a big one. Others include iron, vitamin b 6&12, vitamins d,c,e, valerian root, and pre and probiotics can all help. Just remember, these are not over night, quick fixes. They can begin to help fairly soon but they will take a couple weeks to really take effect. The benefits are worth it.

That's huge, and definitely something to be proud of.  I don't know if you're familiar with the term ""pink cloud"", so I figured I'd mention it here.  I was on Oxy, then dope, then fent for all of 22 yrs.  I got clean Feb 10th.  That was my first day without fent and actually subs too I'm now off of.  The first month was something else.  I almost felt like Superwoman, just knowing I actually went thru the full withdrawal without relapsing or picking up once it was over and I could function again made me SO HAPPY, SO PROUD, SO POWERFUL!  For me, my pink cloud lasted about a month, it's different for everyone tho.

It's pretty much the few months, to years that become much harder to handle after your pink cloud ends.  The lies you made while using, fooling family, regrettable decisions you made while using...all this is the hardest part.  For a few months there, I couldn't help but constantly remember the things I did that I regretted.  It's extremely hard to face things when you have a clean mind, especially at first.  I'm at 150 something days in now and I can tell you, in my experience that first few months of the rollercoaster of anxiety and depression was HARD on me, not gonna lie.  

However, it does get easier with time, but relapses happen when we're all the sudden experiencing deep, painful emotions.  This is why if it's possible for you to - I definitely would suggest you find a therapist in addiction counseling, like, asap.  Also, I never thought NA was anything special and probably wouldn't be for me.  Boy, was I so so wrong.  When you stop chasing dope, cut off all the ppl you used with, you find yourself having a lot more idle time and I salute you for getting into sports because it helps fill that idle time and also activates the receptors in your brain that are now repairing from drug use.  Going also helps you make acquaintances/friends with ppl who do things other than party or use all day.  You'll also hear so many stories that are just like yours and it reminds you constantly how terrible drugs have affected ppl that are now thriving.  It also definitely helps you stay focused and not relapse.  I had written my story here after processing my addiction, I invite you to read it if you think it might help.

But, Bravo!  Really!  This is a huge win.  Just remember, there's no such thing as ""one more time"" when clean, it'll always end up spiraling and you'll have to go thru the wds and everything else all over again.  It's totally not worth it, especially how much ur kicking ass right now.  STAY STRONG, BROTHER! 💪💪🫡",3,t3_1lswqyx

Recovery is alot of ongoing work, like your husband is doing. Its also such an opportunity for growth. I think for me, if i didnt have an addction to force the issue for me, id probably have never done what i needed to to make myself a better person. Id have probably just kept unconsciously drifting through my low key miserable existence. Having an addiction ruining my life made me do something about it. 

Sometimes recovery feels like a chore, like i have to do everything the hard way all the time. So when i feel like that i try to think about how much better my life is now, how much more pleasant and easy it is just to exist with myself.

My husband has said that he feels the exact same way as you do about addiction. That it kind of feels like an opportunity that he doesn't know he would have gotten otherwise. The IOP that did was DBT based and he said that was probably one of the most life-changing things he ever did. He said that he wished they had classes like that for middle school and high schoolers to help kids grow up more emotionally healthy. He said if he would have been taught some of the stuff, he probably wouldn't have had an addiction in the first place. But he says better late than never. 

Sometimes I still feel like I struggle more than he does but maybe I'm just way more outward about it. cPTSD is seriously such a struggle for me but I do think it's helped me relate and be more empathetic towards him with his addiction.",3,t1_muxd56a
8264,mdwaou6,1iuc959,Day 24 Clean,[deleted],"When you first got off the fent did you get these weird like brain flashes while trying to sleep? Idk how to describe it really. Like I'll be thinking about a memory then it just flashes and I can physically feel and hear this pulsating effect it's like a split second thing tho. Been tapering off from a .05-.06 a day habit (wax bags - East Coast) and got down to literal specks, like the 1/4 of a key bump and I do that maybe 3 times a day. Only reason is to teeth the wirhdrawl so to speak. Once I level out I drop the size again, and it's the withdrawl duration and agony shrinks each time. I use perc 5s and perc 15s to fight the urge since the potency isn't even close but kinda tricks my eyes, nose and brain into feeling satisfied at least temporarily instead of backsliding on the fent taper. This way I can sleep at least 5-6 hours, manage to take a shower and brush my teeth and eat at least enough so I'm not starving. 

Initially I was supposed to go to detox/rehab but I had to wait at least 2 weeks while on leave to force my income to be low enough at least for the month to get the state to cover it 100% otherwise I'd be paying like 10K outta pocket if not more, which is at least half of all the money i have

I used gabapentin and kratom the first weekish. I stopped both because I didn't have control and didn't want another dependency. I have stayed very active in this sub, been journaling and exercising as much as I'm physically able. I tried my best to have consciousness during my acute withdrawal. I tried to really feel and remember that I never wanted to be there again. I'm 35, and I think I'm finally realizing that if I stop putting poison in my body, exercise, and address my mental health, I just might be able to be clean AND happy. I'm trying a more holistic approach, because MAT only works for me until I come off. I don't change anything while I'm on it. I don't know if any of this helps, but I hope so.",4,t1_mdwaou6

The withdrawal and the bullshit are still fresh in my mind. Things usually get dangerous for me around the six month to one year mark. I become very complacent. I've rebuilt everything, and life is good. That's when that voice creeps in and says, ""Come on. We can chip. Just once or twice. We deserve it."" I had the money trigger I talked about, but talked myself down. I know it sounds like cliché bullshit, but I can work through a trigger pretty quickly by shifting my focus and keeping myself busy.

For me it’s a passing thought, and I usually try to immediately find something else to do. 

For me yeah 4-8 months is where I usually run into problems. A lot of the time it’ll be right after I stop having PAWS symptoms.

8286,mdau4fk,1irrgjh,Benefits of Quitting Opiates?,Fringelunaticman,"I'm on the bad end of the spectrum at the end, but it took 13 years to get there. I was a homeless addict who hadn't showered or brushed my teeth for months. I was walking around with open sores on my arms and legs, my hands were constantly black from the crack pipe I smoked after shooting up and I ate 1 meal from the McDonald's dollar menu every 2 days. I was 6'5 ""and weighed 140lbs. I got so bad and saw no way out that I tried to OD. But that was just 1 more thing I failed at. 

Now, I am 225 lbs, and I have a 6 pack. I officiate 2 different college sports as a job, and I own a house. Financially, my wife(also a former addict) and I are doing ok and are able to save a little bit each month to put into the stock market. We both enjoy what we do to make make money, we don't have any friends that use drugs, but more importantly, we have friends and a social life. We are healthy and make all our meals, I do crossfit and bjj, and she does yoga. We are in a daily routine, and we do the 3 most important things a person can do to have a good life, and that is exercise, eat well, and sleep. I get to travel all over the country, and no 2 days are alike. Life is full of endless possibilities nowadays. 

None of that could be possible if I was using. And none of that was really possible even when I was early in my addiction, even when I was a functioning addict. Even early on, if I had the choice between working out or using, I used. And if I was high, I wasn't going to put the effort into working out or making my own meals. Convenience was king. Or if I wasn't feeling well, I didn't hit the gym to make myself feel better. No, I found drugs to make me feel better. 

So, honestly, the benefits to living life without opioids is actually living your life. You get to do things besides chase a high or wait for an hour on your dealer when he said he was 2 minutes away. Or be high and sit around. Or feeling like trash because you ran out and you don't get paid for another 2 days. You get to hang out with people who are improving their lives instead of destroying them.  And that gives you opportunities. 

I have almost 10 years clean, and people always warn me not to take my sobriety lightly. But these people don't truly understand the difference between the 2 lives I have led. One life was completely miserable and wasted, and the other is full of possibilities and wonder(it's amazing how good life is when you do the right things even when they are hard). 

Finally, quitting and staying sober is a lot of work. It doesn't happen overnight, and life doesn't get better overnight. It takes time and effort as it took me at least 3 years to start getting integrated back into society. You may not be as bad as I was. 

Seriously, it's a day and night difference",48,t3_1irrgjh

8288,mdavqp5,1irrgjh,Benefits of Quitting Opiates?,Strange_Television,"What are the underlying reasons for your use of opiates? For me, I was self medicating poor mental health - it was my way of coping with everything, eventually. I relied so heavily on opiates though that they became a problem as big as if not bigger than the things I was trying to escape from. I was sedated constantly but no longer able to get high, £10k in debt from buying illicitly, had no real coping mechanisms for life. 

Since getting on bupe 3yrs ago, I've changed my life completely. I started going to recovery groups and engaging with the help on offer. The best things to have come out of it for me have been learning real ways to cope with things - it's a journey I'm still on but I can face challenges these days and actually accept/go into them now.  By overcoming challenges related to my recovery, I've gained a lot of self esteem and am happy with myself. I stopped bleeding money into bitcoin for pills and paid off my debt. I found a job that I enjoy and am helping people. I've learned how to be open and honest. No worrying about running out, withdrawals. I ultimately stopped running and escaping things and finally faced them. It was a lot of pain in the beginning but it was pain I needed to feel for a very long time. I've let go of it now and am focusing on the present and the future.

I didn’t recognize who I was anymore, I hated looking in the mirror, I hated leaving the house, I hated photos being taken, I stopped seeing my friends because I was ashamed of my weight. I felt so disgusting and hated what I had become. When I got clean the weight started falling off, I lost 75lbs in a matter of months. It was so refreshing. Not only was I sober and in a good program dealing with my mental health issues but I also was starting to recognise the person in the mirror again. It’s also been a huge motivator for keeping me clean, because I never want to get anywhere close to that weight again. I know most people lose weight while using and gain it during recovery but for me it was the opposite.

8295,mdb07ce,1irrgjh,Benefits of Quitting Opiates?,Maryssa7,"Hey! I really want to help you with this as I have come off oxycodone and did it myself and cold turkey only by taking supplements and eating better. Yes the first 2-3 days are hardest, but once you get to that 4th to 5th day, you start to feel so much better. But I’m talking pretty minimal withdrawal symptoms even on the peak days. Mostly fatigue, maybe some brain fog and restless legs are my worst. 

I found the most helpful was taking Kratom, but only for the first 5-7 days because then you won’t be feeling withdrawal symptoms from that too. 

Aside from that, take an amino acid complex capsule or two in the morning in an empty stomach, then take 5g of tyrosine along with 1000mg of phenylalanine. 2x a day, but not later than about 4pm.

In the morning take 400mg of selenium (regulating your thyroid) but take vitamin e and zinc along with it for best absorption. Take a METHYLATED b vitamin complex. Huge for helping with energy! But only first thing in the morning as it can keep you up if you take too much too late in the day. 

Make sure you have your electrolytes in order. I add baja salt mixture to my main water but also make sure your drinking filtered and not tap water! Super important on top of that!!

Lastly, VITAMIN D K AND MAGNESIUM. They all go hand in hand and you neeed 5000-10000 minimum of vitamin d along with 100mg of vitamin k with the vitamin d so you don’t get vitamin d toxicitiy, and take 200mg of pure magnesium biglycinate everyday, 3x a day… empty stomach!!

Do jumping jacks every hour. Breathe through the nose constantly. Gives your body way better oxygen and healing 

Smoke some weed at night if you can’t sleep

Take really warm showers and add some baking soda to a bath even if you need to relax your body, especially before bed, it helps the muscles relax! 

When and if you can ANYTIME you can, get outside! You need the sun and you need to ground yourself as much as possible. Super super important as well! 

I hope this helps! I’m day 10, I’ve also done those now a couple of times so I know the aftermath and that you’ll feel great by day 14! Without a few of these supplements anymore! But the main minerals and vitamins, always take anyways and make sure you eat good and get outside!

I was a closeted user and my family had no idea what was going on because I still maintained a job and could afford paying top price for the scripts.  Ultimately I just hated myself and how “behind” I felt in life.  My fiancé walked out on me because I couldn’t get my shit together and as terrible as that was it was the kick in the ass I needed.  You just get tired of feeling the hopelessness.  I ended up doing a medical detox, got on Vivitrol monthly injection for the cravings, and attend NA and surround myself with people that actually support and understand me.  It’s def not easy and it really does help to avoid certain people, places, and things - but like many others said in this thread - you are the only one that knows when you are ready. No one will do “recovery” for you.  And I was a $500 a day habit and to now have that money not blown everyday - your finances will almost instantly be better - at least in my experience.

I never referred to it as that bc I still would like to think that I didn’t have a fair shot bc of covid bc at 1 year clean was January 28th 2020 I had just gotten a new long term job, a new girl that I’m still with today, and I was moving to the city to live the city life starting February 1st. It was the first time in my life where I felt like good things manifested and were going to continue to come to me.  I felt really good, accomplished, and like I was never going back at that 1 year. I also didn’t know the world would shut down from a manufactured mutated flu. 

My situation was a little affected tho I realize now I can’t blame covid, but I sort of lost hope in society during covid. I knew covid was bullshit I didn’t take the vaccine and I had to deal with a lot of family friends and coworkers forcing it on me, 1 year later I also lost my job bc I didn’t take it. But before that work was slow to null. Life got really different really fast, despite being with the girl I knew I wanted to be with. I started to lose the faith. I lost the future I saw for myself. Then all that idle time eventually got me relapsing at the two year point where I knew that I was seriously fucking up bad but I didn’t care. I knew by doing that that I was going to probably be on maintenance meds for a long time bc I wouldn’t want to go through the withdrawal again and that’s exactly what happened.  Do I regret it? Fuck yea. Do I look back on it and think that I just didn’t feel good. I felt nothing, and I had this thought like who cares. Yes, bc I definitely did feel that way bc I remember feeling that way for 3 quarters of 2020 before I actually caved to my addiction. Was it covid or was it the pink cloud or was it both? I’ll never know until I try to get off these damn subs but they keep you in a state of why stop if my life doesn’t force me to stop ya know? Usually w the short term opiates something bad has to happen in order to motivate you to stop like when I was doing dope. But the side effects and the feeling of feeling trapped is stronger than ever. But when I think back to how I felt before I caved in it’s like really hard to jump back on that horse again. I’m stuck.

I personally don't know what's going to happen to you. You've been using for a long time so that makes me think this is just a respite before PAWS kicks in but you've been using a mild opioid so I am hopeful for you that you won't get PAWS.

I was on subs for the first year, and then went onto Buvidal, one of the slow-release bupe injections (its known as Brixadi in the US) and I've been on that for 2 years now. My prescriber has been clear that I won't be forced off it and that reducing down and stopping it needs to be my choice only. I took a full year out of work to focus on recovery and I needed the stability from the Buvidal to work through my problems and make the right changes to my life. I had to do a lot of things that I knew from past behaviour could and likely would result in relapse if given the chance. Having the bupe pushed me to learn how to cope and deal with things differently and I've gradually become better equipped for that. Relapse and thoughts of using have gotten fewer and far between. I do plan to eventually come off it, and I'm getting closer to that all the time. Recovery is a long and multi faceted process and it's ok and often necessary to need time to work through it.

8366,m7psawn,1i3pcgc,5 months. ,Legitimate-Duck1536,"First off, good job on getting clean and making it over 5 months, it’s not easy. 

Second of all, with opiates (fent especially), it can take a really long time for your brain chemistry to fully recover i.e. it’ll likely take some time until you feel “normal” again. 

Some say it takes about a year for your brain chemistry to recover for every year of abuse but I don’t know how accurate that is since I abused blue’s and then fent for at least 3 years and after being clean for almost a year now I feel like I’m like 90-95% recovered from a mental/psychological standpoint. I found that regular exercise and proper supplementation helped a lot, especially in the first 6 months so I’d definitely recommend that if you haven’t started. 

Another thing to look into is medication. There are a lot of different opinions on going this route and I haven’t personally gone down this route but I do know ppl that have had a lot of success with it - especially the lethargy, anxiety, depression, etc. 

However, I have a friend that was really struggling with anhedonia/lethargy/anxiety even after a year clean from fent/meth but he started taking Wellbutrin and it’s helped him a lot. 

But most importantly for you, it’s great that you’ve been able to put things into perspective and focus on finding happiness in everyday life. That’s the best possible mindset. And I wouldn’t consider Kratom or even prescription medication as cheating — the goal is to stay clean from opiates permanently and ppl get there in different ways. 

Wish you the best!!!",1,t3_1i3pcgc

8380,m504pfn,1hrlrpn,5 months sober and still hate my life and am completely miserable. Is there any way out?,Due_Donkey2725,"Hey there! Congratulations on making it 5 months. Some people can't put 2 days together so 5 months is something to be proud of. Now, you say that your issues started long before you started using. Were you self-medicating due to mental health things? Sometimes medications don't work for people. If you've tried a lot of meds and are having a hard time finding ones that work for you, there's actually a genetic test that they can run which will tell you what medications will work for you based on your unique DNA[Genesight - Psychotropic Testing](https://genesight.com/product/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=performance-max&utm_content=&utm_term=&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAj9m7BhD1ARIsANsIIvC-_9u3DZaKZGq514uaHO57vutGsLwwpye3vmJ-MiilezwpwS6sFUcaAlJEEALw_wcB)

And usually your insurance will cover it. Of course medications are not the end all solution, but sometimes they can be a very effective tool, especially if someone was self-medicating for things like depression, anxiety, ADHD, PTSD, Bipolar Disorder, anything really.  When I was using I was doing so to cope with feelings of anxiety, and depression and it turned out it was mostly due to unmedicated ADHD. Now that I have that under control, my life has gotten exponentially better. Most of us have underlying mental health things going on, and it's important to address these things because mental health is just as important as physical health (possibly more important because your mental health can have an adverse effect on your physical health)
The other thing that you said that stood out to me is that no one will hold your hand through this. That is true, to a point. No one is going to hold your hand, but there are people who will stand beside you through the worst parts.  Men and women who's job/ profession is to help you through a time like this - substance abuse counselors, or regular counselors for that matter. People who are compassionate, empathetic, and most importantly non-judgemental and will help you gain the tools you need to get through bumps in the road like this, or just be willing to listen if you've had a crappy day or week. 

The other resource that's out there that can be helpful are free self-help groups. They have local ones or online groups. But a lot of local groups will constantly have sober parties or cookouts or little get together s where you can go and meet sober people. There are so many different ones that I couldn't even list them all but some of the big ones are [Alcoholics Anonymous - Find A Meeting](https://findrecovery.com/aa_meetings/)  [Narcotics Anonymous ](https://www.narcotics.com/na-meetings/)
[Online Meetings - NA & AA](https://aana.live/)
There's [SMART Recovery ](https://meetings.smartrecovery.org/meetings/) which is based on evidence based practices (recovery methods proven to work through scientific testing) 
[Recovery Dharma ](https://recoverydharma.org/meetings/) which is based on Buddhist principles and in most meetings they have a group meditation for part of the meeting or[Refuge Recovery ](https://refugerecoverymeetings.org/meetings) which is also based on Buddhist Principles. They all also have online meetings so if going somewhere isn't your thing right now or if you live somewhere where there's not a lot of in person meetings, you can use your phone or a laptop to connect. And you dont have to talk at any of these meetings if you don't want to but sometimes it helps to listen to other people's stories and hear what works for them. Kind of like take what you need and leave the rest. ( I  generally dislike slogans but that one is true(

And hey, what are your hobbies? It's easy to lose track of what we enjoy doing when we are drinking or getting high, but now that you're sober, it's so important to find some hobbies that you enjoy doing- whether it's working out, coloring, doing yoga, cooking, making things, building things etc I promise you that it feels so good to have something that brings you joy and happiness in your life. Something that you look forward to doing. If you're not sure what kind of hobby you would like to do. If you're not sure what you would like to try [Here's a list of 1000 Hobbies You Can Try](https://www.burlapandblue.com/list-of-hobbies/) If you try something and don't like it, try something else until you find something you love to do :)
There's also an app called Meetup and sometimes they'll have little gatherings for trivia night or star gazing or a hiking club. It's worth checking out 

Your brain and body is still healing. So be patient with yourself and just take it one day at a time. Make sure that you're eating right (processed foods and junk food can make us feel crappy too). Your body and brain needs those nutrients to heal itself and just to function properly. Drinking enough water is also essential. Our body is mostly water and if you're dehydrated everything is affected. Lastly, exercise can be so beneficial. Believe me I know it's easier said than done, but even just getting outside in the sun can bring out those feel good neurotransmitters in your brain and make you feel a lot better.

Good luck! Sorry for the long post but I get it, I've been there. It took me 7-8 months before I started feeling human again (but I also used for almost 20 years). I've been clean 3 years and some days are still a struggle. But most days are okay. And you will get there. I promise. Nothing is worth starting from day one again.",9,t3_1hrlrpn

I even got the things I wanted to get in life and then boom covid happens … tried my best through covid made it to the end of 2021 … I want to get off everything so my brain goes back to equilibrium again but sometimes I just feel like don’t even bother bc I missed the boat (which isn’t true). With the things I know now I wish I had 5 months off everything so keep it up. Get invested into that spiritual side of things. Being on meds since 15 is tough.

That means something very fortunate or unfortunate.  If we don’t find What’s inside of us whats inside of us will destroy us. Western meds make that a lot harder tho it’s still possible.  

It sounds like you’re comparing yourself with society which everyone is guilty of including me. Society is bullshit and it’s all changing soon anyway mark my words, and you’re going to want to be sober for when the time comes. Don’t get caught up in the money thing. You have to look within. It was always within never without everything outside of you is material. Find what’s inside of you and harness it. Focus on the little things and realize that that’s where the beauty lies. The beauty lies in the battle. It’s all perspective of things and society indoctrinated us to have the wrong perspective in this life. They want everyone stuck, stagnant, a rudderless ship with no purpose. Meds are just going to mess that all up. Keep working through it you are 10 years younger than me you’re gonna be okay.

I quit suboxone day he came to house telling me had stage 4 cancer. I'm 10 months clean. Feel fuxing great. Quit smoking cigs too. Anyway, I don't have like one close friend anymore. Things change in life. I'm not sure what I'm going to do. Someone else will eventually will fill the void though. Have trust in God.",2,t3_1hrlrpn
8387,m50skuj,1hrlrpn,5 months sober and still hate my life and am completely miserable. Is there any way out?,CarefulVegetable1108,"I really appreciate the folks that have weighed in on your story and I appreciate your honesty. i do agree with many of the points made in this thread. i think you and i share the same thoughts when it comes to AA or NA or other addiction community groups. I went for 5 years plus sober and just never truly connected with anyone. Everyone seemed 'normal' and i never felt comfortable a single time in all those years. i am also really struggling with finding a job at 59 when before i didn't ever have an issue. when i was using i was automatically productive because i mentally offset activity with the addiction. now i don't have a job and am drug and alcohol free and there's a big gap i am still trying to find ways to fill.   i am a very fortunate person though in that i have a gym facility close to me and sincerely like working out. i DON""T drink enough water - but to echo many folks whom have commented here - it absolutely makes a positive difference. i do think, from what you have described, you could benefit from nootropics working with a physician or RDN.  I have a script for Sermorelin and LDN (Low Dose Naltrexone). Both have anti-depressive properties but do take a few weeks before you notice the effects. I also take a twice daily dose of patented NAD+ Supplement of TRU Niagen for cell regeneration. Candidly, it's hard to find a Practioneer that will prescribe nootropics, but for me, i find that the 'lows' are far less intense and congrats on \[5\] months. I am only \[6\] months myself and i'm one whom is very hard on myself and have a long way to go for sure. One common thread you've most likely read is that full 'mental and physical' recovery takes a minimum of \[6\] months and i can tell you - i don't have daily reminders that 'I'm normal' but i have more of these days than i did even \[2\] months ago. I should also mention that I believe Jesus is who He said He is and only recently have i started reading the Bible again. One of the reasons i bring this up is - you ought to read the book of Job - because Job expresses - almost verbatim - the way you feel per your post and oddly - sometimes knowing someone's dark despair - not even of their own accord - can oddly make your feel better.  I hope this reply helps you in some way!

8390,m4zuklh,1hrlrpn,5 months sober and still hate my life and am completely miserable. Is there any way out?,ly5ergic,"If you don't try you don't fail is completely false. Not trying is failing, feeling terrible, and like nothing will work, or is working, because of not trying is failing. It wouldn't feel so bad if it wasn't. The thing you fear is already happening so trying isn't going to make anything worse. I am not calling you a failure by the way, I am saying this is what it feels like to be in a moment of failing. 

It's not easy but you have to push yourself to talk to people, try new things, find something you are interested in. It feels easier to not try but really it's agony and you have just tricked yourself it's easier or more comfortable. Opiates just numb and make it more bearable. The cycle of just trying to stay high, get the money together, trying not to get sick that sucks too. That becomes your life's focus and meaning. You have to push yourself to find a new focus and meaning. It's not something you can just figure out by thinking you have to put yourself out there, connect with people, do new things ,and stuff will start coming together. That is the only way out. Most good things take effort and aren't necessarily easy but once things start working it is so much easier than sitting in emotional pain and fear. Getting started and sticking to it is the hardest.

I don't want to be harsh. You quit that's amazing and really hard to do. If you got through that you should be able to do this too. It's not that different.

Try to focus on the good things. What things you do that feel good. If you try something and it goes bad try to see what part did work or maybe what you could do differently so it goes better next time. Try to pay attention to improvements. It feels good when you feel you are making progress, but it's easy to ignore positive changes and it feels hopeless then.

Good luck and congratulations on what you have done so far.",1,t3_1hrlrpn

It could be different for others but maybe you're just not ready to be clean yet. Maybe you haven't fully hit rock bottom. I was using for 17 years and I was in and out of treatment centre's since I was 19 years old and each time I'd go back out and relapse it was straight back into active addiction for me and each time I was gone longer and it was only getting worse. I guess what you need to ask yourself is have you really lost enough I don't know exactly what you've been through but it got to the point where I had to go through some very traumatic shit to kind of help push me back towards recovery. I shot myself by accident cause I was involved with some stupid shit at the time and I was trying to carry shit into my kitchen when I was high on fent I almost blew my leg off. It was a dark time, witnessing stabbings, seeing people die I guess just ask yourself what is it really that you want from life?

I've only been clean for almost a year in a half now and trust me I was there when I was clean for 5 months I was very used to a high risk lifestyle of crime and addiction I was so bored of being sober because I was so use to something crazy happening in my life everyday that I thought I was just honestly meant to be a criminal and an addict for the rest of my life. Yet things eventually started changing, you can't just quit drugs and expect life to be different you have to change everything you were doing. Be a better person, I know it's deep inside all of us and when you start making change I 100% can tell you you will start to feel better.

I was clean for two years, and the ENTIRE time I craved opiates, and alcohol oddly. I spent every minute awake craving the two, I wasn’t getting any help. Then, one day I got weak and relapsed. My husband found me dead on our kitchen floor when he came home from work that day…. The next day I walked into the methadone clinic, unsure of what to expect. I don’t care that I need methadone. What I love about this medication is it took the cravings completely away! Plus I love the therapy that goes along with it! I understand a lot of people want to get completely off of everything. But, personally, I tried doing it that way, and it was the hardest two years of my life.. I wish I could have done it without needing medication. I look at it like I’m taking my psychiatric medication that I take on a daily basis that helps improve my daily life.

My apologies, I wasn’t trying to make this about me. I only wanted to share how methadone has been positive in my life and I get so excited when I hear it works for others!

I eventually got a trach in, left the hospital with it, and my neck became horribly infected, partly because of the trach and partly from missing shots in my neck.

During that time, I had gotten severe frostbite on my feet but didn't know it. I mean, I guess I kind of did. I knew something was wrong, I just didn't know exactly what. I went to the hospital mainly for a throat infection, and when I got to the hospital, they told me my feet were in horrible shape and that I was likely to lose them. I was in the hospital for a few more days, and I had to make a decision to stay and undergo months of surgery to possibly save my feet or to get amputations and start clean with prosthetics. I chose the latter.

From there, I came home to my parents' house and began working on getting my life sorted out from the mess of the last 6.5 years. I didn't want to be clean, though; I just couldn't get high anymore. I ended up getting stuff delivered to my parents' house a couple of times. I've been on Suboxone since January.  No dope, just coke/speed--as if that's any better.

Anyway, after getting high a few times, I decided I didn't want to live that way anymore. I just didn't understand a different way to live at that time. I'd been clean before, but I don't know. It was like it had been so long since I've lived that way that it felt impossible to do.

I started going to Drug and Alcohol counseling, Mental Health therapy, and a few meetings. I was very busy with everything going on with my health, though, lots of appointments and places to go, so in my free time, I decided to write. That eventually turned into a full-length memoir and coverage by Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan, which is coming out hopefully this week.

It's been a hell of a journey so far, and I'm just grateful to be alive. I remember when I first got home, just being grateful for a cup of juice or some oatmeal, even a blanket, because it had been so long since I'd had anything. It was a total culture shock. I'd lost everything, but now I'm finally starting to get some things back, and I couldn't be happier.

My girlfriend is now clean as well. She left Kenzo in May, went to rehab, and a sober house. Now she's doing some outreach stuff as part of larger programs down there and working. Life is okay today.

Edit: spelling and to say, Thanks for the congratulations, I never expected I would live to hear someone say that. Means a lot.",1,t1_nkoq0jk
8440,nitg139,1o33is2,I just recently got clean from fent using the burnese method with suboxone,AllanPeaux,"Yooo thats fucking great dude. Im not a doc so I say this with hesitation, but if you still have subs you could slowly and I mean slowly work your way down to nothing, and it may make it a bit easier. But its probably better you just keep chugging along and cut out the subs as well. Just being real tho, the stuff your describing is the really hard part of coming off the shit. Because it could linger for weeks / months. I dont say that to discourage you but if youre like me you wana know the deal. What helped me was just staying busy and that could mean anything. Like another person said working out is HUGE when coming off and probably the best thing you can do other than stay hydrated and sleep (i know its really difficult to) but it can be hard to bring yourself around to doing it. So when I say stay busy I mean whatever the fuck other than being around people (including your phone contacts) that'd make you even consider picking up. You could possibly see a doctor and get something prescribed to help you sleep, but take that lightly because I went that route and am now dependent on sleep aid (i guess its better than dope tho). And lastly, just talk to people. Get on here and talk. Call a friend / family, and talk. Hell go to the store and talk to whoever. On top of everything else what's gona help you is removing yourself from that isolation of hiding and using. You got this. Your doing great. Keep it up.",8,t3_1o33is2

I slept about one hour every 3-7 days (but I already have a problem with insomnia) and not even seroquel or trazadone (which CURED my insomnia before) didn't even help.  One thing I will tell you though, is no matter how tough it gets, you will eat and sleep again, and you will get your energy back, I triple-promise you.  I was wondering if I would ever come back from it, and I did.  And believe me I was scared.  I didn't eat for a month, I shit you not.  I will be clean 6 months on the 1st.  If possible, do suboxone or subutex, no need to suffer if you don't have to.

My addiction strained my family, costing $600 for 60 extra pills monthly beyond my 90-pill prescription, and it was worsening. For years, I caused my sister and mother heartbreak, tears, fear, and financial stress. They longed for me to overcome opiates, save money, and return to work, freed from that orange bottle. I’m unemployed and grateful for their love, patience, and support, but despite knowing about my progress, they haven’t acknowledged it—no congratulations, hugs, or kisses. It’s been a miserable week as my sister and I care for our mother, both of them grim since my first week off opiates.  I feel you very much. have a great weekend.",7,t3_1nxl3yh

I've really struggled since I've gotten clean. I have 6.5 months off of fentanyl/ dry tar and Xanax. I'm 37 and this is the longest time I've been substance free since I was 12. Subs alone don't do it for me even at 3 a day. My doctor is thankfully awesome and has me.on a good combination of medications that keeps me comfortable and not in a frenzy always searching for comfort. Mentally and physically. Gabapentin works wonders and Clonidine has also helped me. Maybe you could give methadone a try if subs don't seem to be enough.  I know a lot of people are against it but if it saves your life then that's all that matters. Give yourself more credit. Don't be so hard on yourself. This is one of the hardest things I've ever done in my life and I've been through some shit. I go to a MAT clinic that is associated with he needle exchange in my city and the doctors there are so sympathetic and compassionate which is something I've NEVER seen before and I've been an addict my entire life. 

Just don't give up on yourself. Your life is valuable and whether you know it or not  YOU CAN DO THIS. Be honest with your doctors because they can't help if you aren't honest. Also they have a new standard for he sublicade shot not. Instead of one shot a month to start they now front load you with a massive dose of bup and then they maintain it after with normal protocol. They are now able to give you more bup than before with the shit. I personally don't get the shit because I'm not ready to give up the control and benefit of having access to take my medication when I want to if I'm craving. 

Hang in there and know there are people who care and your life is very valuable. Congrats for getting off the Xanax. That's also a super hard thing to do. If you need help figuring out how to talk to your doctor my DMs are open anytime or if you ever just want someone to talk to💜

Another thing to mention is this medication works the best when it's paired with some sort of treatment. If you can swing it I would highly recommend going to inpatient rehab. I always thought it was stupid and Id never need it but then I had to go when I got out of jail and it was a huge help. I was there for 42 days. You learn so much and just being away from the outside world for a while helps a ton too. But if you can't there's tons of outpatient options too and they can help get you the skills you need to live a sober life. That combined with medication is the only reason I've been clean. It makes everything much more manageable, and having a support system of other people that are going through/went through the same exact shit you are is a massive help as well.

Since methadone, I went back to school, became a barber/hairstylist, got married, got custody of my then 10 yr old (she’s 15 now), we bought a house (I’m actually a homeowner!!!), and I started my own business.

8530,mzxcixy,1lkpa00,Hope I OD,lelebabii,"Thank you. The crazy part is I feel like my life fell apart after I got clean but I can't give up. I don't want to die. My entire family is dead and I have three children but I only have a relationship with one because I ruined it with the other two. I have to be a role model for him.  My son is 19 and during my addiction I was not the greatest parent. At times I was even abusive. I had two children by the time I was 17 and had no clue what I was doing and was on my own since 15. While I was in rehab and away my son began using crack cocaine at just 19. He's now incarcerated and a felon leaving me alone but I take accountability for this. I should have done better for my children. His father died two weeks after he went to jail of an overdose and the day of his sentencing just one month later his paternal grandmother overdosed and died. The turning point for me was I died for 15 minutes after doing a shot. I was running around New Orleans a major dope dealer and my supplier got mad because I started business with someone else and he sent a girl to set me up with a hot shot. They sold me a bag of crushed up Narcan pills and I did did it in a shot. You're not supposed to inject Narcan into your blood stream. 

There is no other way out. But the truth of the matter is you're not going to stop until you're tired of being sick and tired. You can't do this because other people want you to I want to rehab 22 times before I finally gave in and decided my life was worth something. I wasn't able to do it until I finally wanted to do it for me but when we're in our addictions we feel worthless and in all reality it is a self-harm type thing it's no different than splitting your wrist. Using dope is a slow suicide. I went to Avenues recovery center and that's where the change for me finally happened. I woke up one morning and something just clicked in my brain I had been sleeping on my couch with a switchblade and pepper sprayed waiting for somebody to kick my door and for 2 weeks wasn't sleeping at night I was literally sleeping in combat conditions my son would stay awake I would sleep and then he would sleep when I was awake because people were after me. 

We are all worth life. And if anybody ever reached us and wants help they can reach out to me and I will help him find the resources or even just bullshit when you're having a hard time or even when you're having good times. Just don't give up on yourself. I can't say recovery has made my life great because it hasn't to be honest but most of that is due to my autoimmune condition. I'm not happy my life hasn't made some like magical transformation but I am alive today and I know that I wouldn't be sitting here writing this right now if I had not begin my recovery. I would be in a casket.

And also a lot of people are against medicated assisted treatment but if that's what saves your life fuck what anybody else says. I looked at it as it's no different than a diabetic needing insulin to live. Addiction is a medical issue it's not a personality problem. But sometimes the hardest part is admitting that you have a problem. You just have to be real with yourself and decide how much your life is really worth.

At the end of the day if methadone is what saved your life go for it if Suboxone is to save your life go for that too but I will say one thing I have to abstain from all substances or I know that I will float back to the same things that I used to do by justifying it in my head. I wish the best to everyone and just know that you are all worth it. I do take Suboxone and a regimen of non-narcotic medications that keeps me stable. It's really all about finding a doctor that cares and doesn't treat you like an addict once you're in recovery.

When I go back I will definitely be starting Wellbutrin to help me get off the Vapes and maybe lose a little weight because it supposedly cuts your appetite.

Obviously, that would mean ending my wonderful, supportive long-term relationship, giving up my great job, leaving my friends and family, abandoning my pets, my volunteer work, my hobbies.

  
I think this is exactly my logic. I would not have to worry about anything except getting a couple hundred bucks a week to fund my habit. Before I went to detox this last time, I was genuinely starving to death (lost 40 pounds and I was thin already). Like, buying food or having a roof over my head who cares? I was shooting dope sometimes 20 hours a day and only cared that I had to go to bed and there weren't more hours in the day to keep going. At that point, being homeless wouldn't have mattered at all.

When I first started methadone, there is this “induction” phase. They start you on a pretty low dose, 30mg. Every morning you go in and dose in the beginning, and you can raise it 10mg a day until you aren’t sick anymore. This was the hardest part. I still was using AND taking methadone at the same time bc I was so sick. I reached a point after about 2 months where it built up in my system and I wasn’t feeling any affects from the illegals.

8550,n08jq72,1lkpa00,Hope I OD,klmnopqrstuvwxy,"Wellbutrin definitely helped me with my appetite too by removing urges to binge eat. 

But as an anti-depressant, it is absolutely amazing. I've always been against anti-depressants (and just medicine in general) because they make me numb and unable to feel any emotions at all (which is horrible, the point of life is to feel our emotions). But unlike other antidepressants, Wellbutrin works on dopamine and norepinephrine levels in the brain. It's given me the motivation to actually do things, and my thoughts are much more optimistic. I can actually say I'm happy/content for the first time in many, many years. 

That being said, I think it also reduces the high I get from dope, which is a good thing because it makes dope less appealing. 

The only side effect I've gotten from Wellbutrin is a decline in short-term memory and word recall (I keep forgetting where I put things). Though this is getting better with time. 

u/LouisvilleBuddy420 \- ketamine has always worked to rewire my brain after a session (and it's given me the most profound experiences that helped me understand the nature of our reality), but Wellbutrin is more long-lasting since it's taken every day.

I couldnt even walk for the first six days. I also had a crying spell for those first six days. But you know what, when I was using I didn't give a shit what anyone thought about it so why would I care what people thought about my detox. Hardest thing I've ever done and I've been through some shit. It didn't get better until I finally gave in and took the subs. I had been through precipitation so many times that I held out for seven days because of fear. I felt so much better I was a brand new person once I finally gave in and took it. The hardest part for me is recovery is my pain level bc of my health problems but I'm working through it. Almost seven months in and honestly I don't even think about it anymore, dope that is. It's been hard finding doctors that will even have compassion for my pain because of me being a former addict. Everything you said was so true though I couldn't have said a bed of myself and I can really relate to that. Don't be down on yourself or hard on yourself just because you're a man. I know many men that are a man's man that couldn't do this. I'm very proud of you!!!

I've done a lot of hard work to recover from drugs so I can live so dying from smoking would feel pretty stupid for me at this point. I'm on a quest to improve my health because I'm still miserable and it's a risk to my sobriety and I know it. 
But yeah wellbutrin is a double win for me because it helps you quit smoking and it also helps you lose weight. It's a very old drug and I don't believe it has many side effects. She's also going to prescribe me the gum and patches

Ketamine is often grouped with psychedelics and has some similar effects, mainly shifting perceptions, creating a new perspective, and a sort of detachment from self.

This is after about 10 years of heroin use and the 10 before that not great either. Methadone has worked wonders for me, subs never helped. They obviously helped physical symptoms but on methadone I haven’t wanted to get high at all, even with someone in the same house/room shooting up beside me multiple times a day. So yeah, I believe in methadone but subs work for people, too. 

As far as feeing the same it just takes time and finding a light, no matter where or how that light may be or come. Plus, at 21 I didn’t have a clue who I was or how I should feel in the first place. You’re young, it sounds cliche but you literally have your whole life ahead of you at that age. There’s a reason drugs are dangerous and now you know why. Try to stay away from your demons, or at least work on them as best as you can. Work on yourself, only you know what is right and wrong for you. As long as you feel in your heart of hearts that you’re actually doing right and you don’t resent yourself and your actions, give yourself a break. Tiiiiimmmmmeeeeee is your friend. Lame, I know.

It sounds shitty but even if you have to cold turkey off of subs, which I doubt you will (there’s tons of other doctors and treatments) you would be alright within a couple of weeks or so as far as physical symptoms go.",6,t3_1kt6808
8571,mtsu7z7,1kt6808,I’ve been off opiates for 6 months I still don’t feel the same.,Sure_Egg_262,"I recently read something that said after getting off opiates it takes 14 MONTHS for your brain to get back to normal function.  And I believe it because it’s been about a year for me on subs and I still constantly crave the stuff. The other unfortunate thing I’ve realized being a recovering opiate addict is once you have that glorious unstoppable numb feeling we get from oxy etc. you never forget it. Getting off it is one thing. Staying off is a whole different ball game. No matter what you’re going to have to face the comedown. Subs just allows you to kick the habit of doing the drug and taper off the drug so the comedown isn’t as bad. 

Advice: I do remember the first time I got off opiates and subs - the one thing that made it very easy for me was Kratom. Now yes people say they can result in the same type of addiction and comedown. But if you do it right you’ll be fine and only do it to get through the worst days.  If you decide to try this make sure you get a few different types of strains and switch them up every few days or so. It’s when you use the same thing for a long period of time that could result in a similar comedown. I’ve personally never experienced any sort of withdrawal with kratom but I am sure there are others with different experiences. That along with weed and making sure I had the next couple days off to just lay in bed and rest helped tremendously. I was also in my mid 20s when all that occurred. Now a decade later I have more responsibility which makes it much harder to stop taking subs. I’ve tried. But every time the withdrawal feeling starts I take just a tiny little bit to keep me from feeling like garbage.  Honestly the doc not responding may be a blessing because the longer you’re on subs the harder it is to stop. 

Another thing. You don’t have to necessarily force quit. I’m sure you can find an outpatient medicinal treatment program around you that can help you refill your script. I went through that when I moved to a different state where online sub docs don’t exist like they did in CA. So it did take some time to even get appointment. The best thing I would suggest is if you can power through a few bad days ( they won’t be nearly as bad as what I’m sure you’ve experienced going cold turkey off oxy itself.) it will take time to feel somewhat normal again but it will happen. Good luck. I wish you the best.",3,t3_1kt6808

Your body still has more than enough capacity to heal itself to be as same or even better than prior to your drug abuse. Stay strong bud. I will highly recommend you find a new doctor for suboxone tho as tapering by yourself suddenly when cravings are high is not a wise move and a one way ticket to relapse.

It may just be depression. You may have to treat that before you are yourself again. Please don’t go back to using. Please remember that depression, sadness, despair is much easier to deal with than everything that comes along with using. I was on oxy/fent for about 9 years.

In what I’ve noticed, there are some things you can do to help the healing. 

Proper nutrition really helps with the healing. opioids can cause calcium and magnesium deficiencies. Magnesium biglycinate or magnesium citrate is a great mineral for everyone to take anyway. They say most people are deficient because of inorganic farming depleting the soil. Those forms of magnesium I listed are highly absorbable. Stay away from magnesium oxide and carbonate, they aren’t as bioavailable. If you look up the symptoms of magnesium deficiency it causes a lot of issues with the body including insomnia, muscle aches, headaches, anxiety, agitation, depression AND it’s a precursor to serotonin/melatonin.

Don’t take magnesium and calcium together as they bind together and your body isnt able to absorb it though. There are other nutrients that help, but magnesium is really good to take.",5,t1_mtsf621

8612,mti1qt3,1krayt4,13 years clean and sober,skimask808,"Not sublocade, I don't believe it was even around when I was first getting sober. But I was put on 24mg of suboxone strip. I entered rehab after the OD with a ridiculous tolerance and even 24mg throughout the day barely helped. Eventually they put me on Zubsolv, which I stayed on a little longer than I wanted. The withdrawals from Suboxone was pretty miserable, I wish sublocade was around back then, at least that takes all the power out from your hands and tapers you slowly.",2,t1_mthibxt

8629,mf6f3kd,1izl02t,Buprenorphine withdrawal,bickynoles,For you I’d say just stick it out cause you haven’t been taking them long enough but to anyone else who dreads the eventual detox from the bupe I recommend switching over the the monthly sublocade shot…it’s the best thing I ever did. Stay on it for 4 months or so and it works its way out of your body so slowly that you are naturally titrating off of it and there are virtually ZERO withdrawals when you stop. This is proven from multiple people I know personally who all say they had zero WD and some of them have been off for years now. If you have the insurance to cover it I promise you it will be the best choice you ever made to help finally kick the opiates for good without fear or relapse because of feeling sick for weeks. As long as you stay on the shot for at least 4 months you WILL NOT GET SICK!,4,t3_1izl02t

I'd taper down to a quarter strip, 2 mgs?, every 36 hours and by the time I stopped I didn't even feel that bad physically. Sub has a long half life so it worked really well to spread my dose out to 36 hours

Edit: guess your not taking sub but it's similar or has some of the same shit in it?",2,t3_1izl02t
8636,mf601nf,1izl02t,Buprenorphine withdrawal,mikeyprk23,"It maybe a little late for it, but if you feel it’s unbearable and you could relapse, it’s best to ask to get back on subs. Then if your insurance covers it I always recommend people taper off Sublocade instead of suboxone. I worked at huge rehab for about a yr as an assistant to the medical staff and from what I saw and heard from the patients, it’s far far easier to taper off on sublocade since your body essentially metabolizes it at the same rate your opiate receptors taper down to non addict levels. In my time there i probably witnessed about 30 patients come off subs with sublocade and 95% of them said they felt no withdrawal symptoms and within few days after a month from their last shot, they all said they felt  better physically, emotionally, and mentally than while on suboxone and sublocade. On the other hand, I’d say about 50% of the patients who tapered off suboxone asked to be put on maintenance after trying to taper off the films or tablets. Personally i never tried sublocade. I stayed on 8mg daily maintenance for about a yr then tapered off across a span of 6 months with my smallest dose being .25mg daily then every other day for about 2 weeks before i made the jump. Very very minimal withdrawals for a less than week doing that",2,t3_1izl02t
8637,mf7vzmp,1izl02t,Buprenorphine withdrawal,Psilanaut,"My experiences were all with at least 2 years of use. But for what it's worth, I'll share my account.

The last time I jumped off at 0.4mg of bupe (we have tablets similar to 0.2 and 0.4mg Temgesic), I had stabilized on 0.4mg for just about 6 days:

Day 1: Tiredness, cold, mild aches  
Day 2: Same as above but multiplied by 3  
Days 3-5: Same as above but increased and severe fatigue plus the runs  
Day 6: It was like a switch flipped and I woke up with my energy back. No runs, very mild aches but more from lack of sleep than anything else.  
Day 6 onward: everything improved. I got back to the gym and that helped immensely.

This was my 3rd time getting off of it. There will NOT be a 4th time.

Only thing I did differently this time, and I know it helped significantly in reducing the intensity of it while keeping my mood more or less upbeat, were these 3 supplements:

1. DLPA (DL-Phenylalanine): 1000mg 3 times a day
2. Agmatine Sulfate - 1000mg in the evening
3. Magnesium Glycinate: 200mg before bed

The other thing I used during the entire taper process which allowed me to heal faster, was the nootropic Selank (the nasal spray). I regret not getting more because I ran out of Selank on Day 3 of the withdrawals.

But on that last day, my last dose of Selank was around 480mcg (240mcg per spray) and when it kicked in, my fatigue was just gone. It didn't last long though. Maybe 5 hours or so. But I know just how helpful it was. I went from feeling like a walking corpse, to running up and down and getting my chores done. I reckon it could help in the healing process after stopping subs.

  
PS: This was after 2 years of daily use. In your case, the withdrawals could be much lighter due to the short duration of use. I reckon you will be back to some semblance of normalcy by Day 4 or 5. Hang in there mate. It only gets better from this point :)",2,t3_1izl02t
8638,mf8w66g,1izl02t,Buprenorphine withdrawal,Snowblinded,"I feel like I've seen stuff like that with bupe before. Remember that the whole half life thing is a double edged sword. The fact that you feel as shitty as you do right now is because of the long half life of your previous taper. In other words, if you'd just gotten yourself addicted to 0.2mg bupe pills the withdrawal would be a breeze compared to what you feel now. So really the 2-3 days is for all the bupe that's been built up in your system not the small amount you're still taking. The end of the tunnel is in sight.",2,t3_1izl02t
8639,mfi9s59,1izl02t,Buprenorphine withdrawal,dark_light376,I didn't feel much wd off 0.4mg. Just few days of discomfort. Acky legs which I used diazepam for couple days and paracetamol for fever. Don't let people scare you. I jumped at 1mg before that and it was too intense. I was also on an ssri so can't say about any depression as that would of helped with that.

8640,mf3uj40,1izl02t,Buprenorphine withdrawal,lillesvein,"Yeah that's what i thought aswell, i feel like the doctor here isn't really experienced with bupe. As she initially wanted me to jump off the 2,4mg after stabilizing for a week prior, and told me the worst would be over in a week. I think she has the idea that the withdrawals are the same for all opioids... But thank you, i will try to tough it out the next 5 weeks of my stay.

Too many people make the jump from too high a dose then experience the same level of not more withdrawals than other opiates. Also too many detox and rehabs make the taper too fast. In my experience and many others i heard the success rate is highest for long term recovery if the person does a long term taper 30-90 days or stays on maintenance for at least like 6 months to give their brain time to stabilize then do a 30-60 taper.,5,t1_mf5oj17

Sublocade was the best thing I’ve ever done for my recovery…I’ve talked to at least 6 other people who were all previously on the shot and all 6 of them told me when they stopped they barely noticed any symptoms whatsoever and 4 of them are still clean today a year on. That is UNHEARD OF in the recovery community. I’ve never seen 4 out of 6 stay clean.

People who are on long-term pain management with fentanyl patches have the same sort of issues coming off of them, the discontinuation process has to be protracted to keep them from being in misery.

All of it is short-acting with a generally short-elimination half-life, but the half-life is sort of complicated with how it sticks to fat cells...which it does permanently. The elimination from fat cells only happens as you turn over those fat cells, which is a slow process but it's always happening (even if you don't lose any weight, the fat you're carrying around today isn't the ""same"" fat from a year ago, it's always being replaced). If you're given a dose in the ER or during surgery, the amount that stays in your fat cells it too small detect or to matter, but if you use it over and over again every day for months or years? It builds up.

This is one of the things that complicates acute withdrawal from fentanyl. You don't really start to get ""better"" in withdrawal until you clear out your system to the point at which your body is no longer reacting to whatever is left.",4,t1_mdvx452

Old wives tale or truth? Does anyone Remember hearing the one that methadone is stored in bone marrow?  Apperently that's true! (to a point). I guess it also can be stored in fat cells and skeletal tissue BUT it seems all the studies I can find were done on rats! So, there's a good chance it is stored there, but a small chance it isnt.  Methadone does have an insanely long half life, and gets ""stacked"" each dose that's taken, and that is the main reason most people think makes the detox LONG, which it is.

It's all well and good if an IV drug user gets a perfect shot right in the bloodstream every time. But that's not reality. A person can do a lot of shots over the course of an addiction. Some hit better than others. Veins are all nice and perky and plentiful at first. Then the years go by. The pickings can get slim. There are misses. Sometimes lots of them. The drugs end up in unintended places, like fatty tissue.

Sometimes you get an addiction recovery ""specialist"" who keeps up on the latest research and understands this. Sometimes you don't. I have a counselor who knows and explained all the fat cell retention stuff to me. I have an RN who is nice and says she won't cut me off my suboxone but sits there looking at me like I'm nuts and tells me there's no way I should still be getting positive tox screens after 5 months clean. I seriously considered lying and saying I relapsed because I thought it might be less embarrassing than sitting there insisting that I'm still clean. I decided f that, but it still sucks. 

I quit using of my own accord. My tox screens are a formality. I'm not really sure why they even bother honestly. I should ask. My consequences are nothing compared to the horrors of some. Lost relationships, lost jobs, lost custody of children, lost freedom. Some choose to take their own lives after fighting for sobriety only to get positive tox screens that result in consequences as severe as getting taken off parole or probation and thrown in prison.

And you're in a very bad situation. I was over three and a half years. My wife relapsed. I was strong too, made it almost four months. 3 months getting high everyday together, ive had enough.  I get on methadone.  She refuses. 2 days later she dies and my world fell apart. Nobody cared I was 3 days ""sober"". Lost my kids for a year. They hit me with drug tests every 2 weeks. For fourteen months. Let her read this. You reread this. We weren't really married,  just together forever,  three teenagers with no mom. I miss her to death.

We’ve been dealing with his relapses for almost a year and a half now and he’s had 4. He was on methadone for forever but he just used that as a backup plan so he wouldn’t get dope sick when he couldn’t score but he continued to get high on it, so it really didn’t work for him.

I mean I’ve heard of people abusing strips and stuff but I couldn’t imagine how! Yeah I’m definitely really struggling mentally with being stuck between trying to accept that I can’t save him if he won’t save himself but also feeling like I can’t give up… everyone always says “you can only get clean for yourself” but i literally got clean for him. we were using 5g of street fent a day and he ended up having a pulmonary embolism and ended up in the ICU, I visited him and he asked me to bring him a vial of dope because he was starting to get sick and I did, then right after I left he did a line and all the machines went nuts and the nurses rushed in with security and basically told him they knew he just did some sort of drug and to give it to them or they’d physically take it, so he handed it over and then his family tried to visit him and the ICU staff told his family that I brought him drugs and basically made it seem like I forced him to do it, so his family all showed up to our house and threw bricks at my truck and tried to beat me up, it was NUTS! I was also banned from visiting him at the hospital and he was basically forced into detox because he couldn’t get dope while in the ICU. So I knew when he finally got out of the hospital he’d be clean, and we both decided since his whole family now knew about us using it was time to get clean. I checked myself into a hospital for detox and by the time he got out of the hospital I was still in detox and finally a few weeks later we were back together and sober. I literally only got sober because I knew for his health we needed to get clean and he would never be able to do it on his own so I did it for him so we could do it together, then he relapsed. I’ve been clean ever since and basically the main thing keeping me from relapsing is knowing if I do, he’ll have no one fighting to keep him sober and he’ll end up dead. I know if I’m using there will be no hope of ever getting him clean, so I keep holding onto the hope that he’ll pick me and staying sober and keeping our family together over drugs but he’s had 4 relapses since we got clean together. I feel like I’m the only one fighting to keep him sober and he’s not even helping himself. He’ll get clean, just enough to get me off his back a little bit, and then as soon as he thinks my guard is down (it never is) he’ll start using again and of course I always know, but he’ll deny it until I go through his shit and find it and confront him then the cycle continues. I just found his shit last Sunday. He’s still using right now but supposedly trying to start detox/go to inpatient, but I know he’ll never do that. The only hope he has is actually sticking to MAT but I’ll believe it when I see it, I just can’t let go… like I know if I leave he’ll end up dying on the bathroom floor. But at this point I’m starting to feel like even if I stay and do everything I can it’s a losing battle… I’m going to ask him to go to his first NA meeting tomorrow but I’m not expecting him to actually go. I’m not letting him sleep in bed with me till he’s sober and it’s been like living with a stranger this past week. We live together but hardly talk. It’s eating me up inside and I pretty much have no one to talk to because if I told my mom about his relapse she would freak out thinking I’ll relapse too and she’d hate him forever for bringing drugs around me so I’m pretty much dealing with this completely on my own and it’s so draining.

Obviously if she doesn’t fully want to get clean that won’t work. My fiance was on methadone and dropped 5mg a week till he could get off and try subs but then he went into precip withdrawals from the subs and never got on them, and never went back to methadone, and just kept using… I totally get the feeling of being like “why could I do this and get clean and stick to it and you can’t?” So many people will look down on you for feeling that way and say everyone’s struggle is different, and that’s 100% true but it’s just natural to feel that way. It’s like hey man, if I can do it you can too! And it makes me feel so discouraged that he’s not sticking to it because I went through literally hell to get clean, and I did it for him but he can’t do the same for me… I started with positive reinforcement the first 3 relapses, and even when I noticed he was using again but wouldn’t admit it I kept telling him how proud I was of him staying clean hoping that it would push him to get himself clean so he wouldn’t disappoint me when I finally had proof that he was using but it just didn’t work… this most recent relapse (caught him last Sunday) has been the worst. We havnt slept in bed together and we’ve hardly spoke all week. We finally talked today and he asked me to please give him a week to get something lined up as far as detox and MAT and if he doesn’t have anything set in stone as far as a plan then he’ll go my route and go through my doctor and get onto either sublocade or vivitrol. My doctor has offered to take him on as a patient but of course he didn’t want to while he was using because he knew I’d find out about him using since I gave access to all his medical records. So basically I’m just leaving it in his hands at this point. I told him I’m pretty much done, and if I don’t see the effort from him and him alone then I’m leaving. The past few relapses we came up with plans together and he would always say what I wanted to hear but never follow through. So I’m letting him either do it on his own, or I’ll be gone. We’ll see how this works out though. I just know me holding his hand and babying him doesn’t work, and he knows this relapse is very different from the last few times because I’ve basically mentally checked out from our relationship since catching him last Sunday. I mean I should say on the outside I’ve mentally checked out, obviously inside I’m fucking dying and so heartbroken, but I’m trying to just shut down my emotions and he’s obviously seen the complete 180 in me from being super affectionate, loving, passionate to someone who hardly even looks at him. I honestly wish for the best for both you and your wife! If you need someone to talk to I’m here! I wish there was a sub Reddit for spouses of addicts, there’s a great group for spouses and loved ones of alcoholics but as far as I know I havnt found any for addicts.

Even though she keeps saying she will. She tells me she doesn't like how tired it makes her. And that she gets all sweaty when getting off the shit even if she has a lot of Methadone.

Omg that is so frustrating!!! I’m so sorry you’re going through that! It will feel so amazing though when you do get the clean UA! So with my sub doctor after like 2 months I was telling her like ummm why am I still pissing dirty?? And she was like ‘oh it’s okay it’s probably just leftover, give it more time’ but every month I was just getting more and more upset, when we finally got to 6 months and it was still dirty I was literally in tears in the office begging them to give me answers because I wanted a clean test so bad, and my doctor was really cool about it and she understood why I was so upset and thankfully she didn’t make me feel judged but my anxiety just made me feel like maybe she really didn’t believe me and was just being nice? So I was ready to beg them to do a hair test or a blood test or something and then finally my 7th month it was clean!

Being addicted to booze, plus a potent gabaergic, seizures are on the way if he loose access to gabaergics (do you know how long he's been using gabaergics?) and potent opis, this is another level of dependency and if you or someone else manages to make him enter an inpatient detox facility which is crucial and stay there, there's a lot of work from his side and both from the stuff side to be done in order to tackle all those addictions.

It's difficult for him and you too ofc. He can actually die from seizures if it happens in the wrong place/time. He's frying both his GABA-A and GABA-B receptors, making seizures a very possible scenario if he is abusing them daily for months. You might want to ask him if he is even alive and warn him (urge him) to get help right away if he likes to continue to breath. If he still doesn't respond, you did your best, because if he doesn't respond or get help, he probably doesn't even care if he dies or not, he doesn't even care the suffering he will cause in the worst scenario that sth *bad* will happen to him.

It's generally a very difficult case for everybody that cares for him. You are doing your best facing a situation like this, and you seem to trully love him but you exhausted all options, and the only thing left is if he chooses to help himself and save this relationship, if not, you tried, he failed, nothing more you can do. Someone else, wouldn't even give him ""days"" to take crucial actions, but seems you really care for him and it's sad to see that things are not improving, not even trying to save the relationship, heck even HIS OWN life!

*I have triple dependency and I can see the struggling (opis, benzos and ΗHC) and the feelings of hopelessness in my relatives trying to help me (I'm seeing it in their faces and feels so painful both for me and them) and I'm about to enter a Bupe substitution clinic (state operated & everything cost free, EU citizen) hoping they can take care of all my addictions (aka tapering me off benzos and give medical grade synthetic THC meds to taper this too). But testing positive for THC due to ΗHC and being on benzos tapering, they might reject me, but at least...I tried!*

Opis numb your feelings, and when not on them, all those depressed feelings will ""slap"" him in his face and realize what his options did to him and the struggling for you and if there are other people that care for him like you do. So, because ""I'm there"", I don't think he doesn't care about you, it's just that opis & gabaergics have gained full control of his life, being dependent to those, is like brain has given the substances to come in the 2nd place of a body needs, when oxygen comes first. If he manages to get sober or at least in substitution, I believe he will get back to you begging for a 2nd chance.

This isn't your issue, let's stay on topic if you truly want him to get better and not knit pick him as a whole human. 

He sounds like a classic addict who is too ashamed and guilty to admit he has a problem yet. I've been there. He knows, he hates it, and the pain it causes him shame wise is something I hope you never feel. HOWEVER, it's time to sit down with him with whoever else (just one person) he is closest with in the world (mom dad best friend brother etc) Take videos in case you need the proof if he denies he does anything, like of  him nodding off or slumped over etc. be kind, stay on topic and give an ultimatum. ""We will do what we need to do to help you, but you have to get help or we are done and we with both (and others) fully cut contact."" Keep it simple and honest. 
The above is IF you want to try to fix it, so you know the proper way to begin this.

Now, if you are DONE. Go to the courthouse and file an official eviction notice. Unless you do this, you have zero legal standing with just your prior 30 day notice. After you do so, hand him a copy with the date highlighted and tell him this is set in stone and you're not backing down. On this date, the sheriff will come and 100% of the locks will be changed, and 100% of his property will be on the curb if he fails to comply. Then, cut all contact bc if you hold firm, you have no other need to talk to him. 

It does sound like opioids or opiates. Could be more, who knows. But it's something and you've reached your limit of what you'll accept.

8787,mdh7ion,1ir811b,Can you care?,94Rangerbabe,"There is a saying, NNA and AA at  Addicts don’t have relationships. They have hostages. It couldn’t bev mmore accurate.   As a recovering addict, I can tell you we are truly unaware of what we are doing to the people around us. in our minds. We think this is not a big deal. Why doesn’t everybody leave me alone? Why can’t I live my life the way I want to it shouldn’t affect you And to great degree. We’re not even aware that you can tell when we’re high because it’s just such a normal state. We are really surprised when we find out how much of our sneaking behavior was glaringly obvious. The desirablething about opiates is they allow you to not care about anything. Your emotional sensitivity is comatose.  Which is why many people take opiates not to get high but to get relief from mental anguish. all the things that bother you make you sad or depressed or guilty or you feel like you can’t live with they absolutely disappear when the nod kicks in and the last thing you want is anything ugly piercing that warm liquid bath that your whole body of mind is submerged in.  It’s an evil evil drug because it amplifies every good feeling kills every bad feeling and the wrath of hell comes down on you the minute you don’t give your body what it wants it’s a feeling that I can’t put into words.. but I know when I’ve been going through withdrawal. I have thought I can see why people would mug an old lady or break into a house to get money or drugs because you’ll do anything to make the agony stop.  You really are a prisoner to your addiction. Unfortunately, everyone else around you is too .  On the positive side, it appears that he’s getting his drugs from a legal source so the chances of a fentanyl tainted dose is small… honestly otherwise he would probably already be dead.   You’re doing the right thing by addressing the problem with him. letting him know it’s not a secret and giving him a hard choice but the fact that he is not arguing with you or trying to manipulate, you is a little unusual. I would expect either righteous indignation or self pity and tears.  You absolutely have to stop supporting him in any way, giving him a home giving him money because the only thing that’s going to Pierce the Veil is disruption of his high. And with that will be desperation physical and mental desperation… which could be dangerous if not, just downright scary. 
Do you have a plan for the deadline? Will you be able to physically remove him if he won’t budge will he pack his stuff up or you going to do it for him or are you going to change the locks? Just things to think about because you  absolutely have to follow through no matter what he says or does no extensions no compromise. You hand him a card or punch into his phone the number of the Rehab or the doctor and you tell him you love him and that you’re not kicking out the person you love you’re kicking out the addict that is consuming him and when he’s ready to fight, you’ll be there.   It’s the last shred of power you have to affect him and if you waiver at all he will know that they’ll always be a way to get around you. 
He will not be able to stop without a professional medical rehab facility to monitor his detox and cold turkey would not be my suggestion. There are lots of medical interventions that can make it easier but the real battle is mental and without Rehab 30-60-90day stay it’s unlikely to stick. 
 Have you considered looking into Al-anon (it’s for families and friends of alcoholics, but any addiction will do) 
Or finding a support group or therapist for codependency, you would be surprised that there is a term for every action in this relationship and learning to recognize why you’re doing what you’re doing. Even if you’ve ended the relationship and you never intend on getting back together or you cut him out of your life completely addressing that part of yourself is a crucial key to minimizing the damage this relationship is inflicting on you in ways
are not even consciously aware of and protecting. You from repeating the same mistakes

But he stopped drinking when he got his new prescription.   I’ve been on his case about it.   But I’m tired of it.  Like I feel bad for him but I’m just tired of dealing with this.  Like he just gives me a little hope and then backslides.   It’s just weird how little he cares that he’s been evicted.  I gave him a written notice to quit that he’s got 30 days to vacate.

Not in the way that someone not on opiates would because right now he’s protected by a constant flow of dopamine from the opiates he’s abusing. So he (IMO) can cognitively understand what it happening and how it is effecting you, but the deep despair that comes from break ups / having to deal with the consequences of your addiction and the grief, guilt and shame that comes along with that, he’s forcing down with (undoubtedly even more) opiates. That said, if this is your partner and they are a) putting you through hell and b) don’t care about what this means long term - if they did - high or not, they would try and talk to you. Explain what’s happening for them. Tell you that they are so sorry (again: he may not feel the guilt and shame fully as he’s numbing himself, but he still has the capacity to recognize the damage caused). 

Girl, RUN don’t walk.

Sadly his hierarchy of needs doesn't include you at the moment and it will require him to choose life over death in order to clean up and hopefully find you or those that love him once again... I sincerely hope it ends up working out for you both but remember what I said about forcing him, it will never work until he's ready and committed to getting clean.

But it would be nothing like what you’re describing.

This guy has got serious problems and you’re doing the right thing getting away from him. Not just for yourself but for him. Like he needs a serious dose of reality.

If you feel that’s something that needs to happen for him, ok, but if you’re willing to make that decision for him then you need to be willing to help him deal with the consequences (if he’s willing to ask for/accept your help). Not only are opioid withdrawals bad enough on their own, but he’s taking two other substances whose withdrawal effects could literally kill him. If I were you, I’d try to get him to see a mental health specialist before any of that, but unless you’re going to at least offer to help him find an inpatient detox, then you have no business trying to interfere with his prescriptions. If you’re plan is to just kick him to the curb, block his number and tell his doctor that he’s a lying junkie (or something to that effect) then all you’re doing is maximizing the overall trauma of the situation, along with his chances of death (whether from withdrawal/seizures, self harm, overdosing on street drugs, etc.).

8804,mdnrafj,1ir811b,Can you care?,Awkward_War4140,I know how to evict someone. The notice to quit is the first step.   Ideally for him he wouldn’t need it to go to court because an eviction on his record will make life harder for him.  But I do know how to get him out legally. Thats just also brutal and I know what it looks like after that. I had a friend who was broken up with and thought she could just not leave.  He evicted her and she’s had the hardest time finding a place since then. It literally took her years to be able to rent a non crackden. No part of me is trying to be vindictive.  I have a 20 year relationship with this man.  I know what he went through to get SSDI as well but I also know how he’s using it. He refuses all non opiate treatments and his diagnosis has been questioned by more doctors than it has been supported by.   His abuse of pain medications is separate from his SSDI though.  He can be both genuinely disabled and have become addicted to his pain meds and stopped being able to use them responsibly.   The thing is I have been trying to get him into treatment and we did the alcohol detox but he doesn’t follow through with treatment.   So at this point his problem is HIS problem.  I can lead and guide and ask him to get help but I can’t force it.  His doctor can withhold prescriptions.  A pain clinic certainly has seen people become addicts more than once.

So at most 10-20 pills a week. I snorted them and that started back up again early November. In between my relapses, I usually use kratom until I can get a doctor’s appointment. If the withdrawals are too unbearable and you absolutely cannot get medical care, the kratom shots will probably help with body aches and fatigue, it helped me go to sleep which was really important for me. Though I wouldn’t depend on it because it’s very easy to get a physical dependence. I’ve seen ppl talk about mega dosing vitamin c and taking otc restless leg meds. It’s just important that you listen to your body’s needs, do what you feel is best as long as it isn’t self destructive.

It’s also important that you stay hydrated!! I used to think that it wasn’t all that important but there was a clear difference in how I felt physically before and after drinking water. At most I could eat was something small and crunchy. I could also throw back some sweet treats like it was nobody’s business. I hear a lot of addicts eating a lot of sweets during their recovery. Don’t make yourself sick with sweets but eating sweets can sometimes make you feel better. If you can get to the pharmacy you should get something to settle your stomach. Hey and going to the ER can be an option. My very first time becoming addicted to 30’s (first time being addicted period) I went to the ER for help. I came out of there feeling like I could live again, I had no idea what was going on but I was scared and in pain, I just wanted help. They were so kind and patient with me. They sent me out of there with comfort meds and had a social worker visit me to set up therapy and psychiatry appointments.
