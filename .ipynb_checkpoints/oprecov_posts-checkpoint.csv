0,1oxfl1d,I actually did it and it doesn't feel real,ryuumonogatari,183,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1oxfl1d/i_actually_did_it_and_it_doesnt_feel_real/,"Today is so special to me. I quit last Sunday cold turkey, finally sucked it up and faced withdrawal head on. But today is extra special because today someone offered me Oxys and I, not even fully through the withdrawal phase and still truly miserable, turned them down.

I actually did it. I chose myself and my future over temporary relief. It doesn't even feel real to me. It seems so silly but for years I've watched people's sobriety journeys with such envy & frustration because I convinced myself I couldn't do it and I would inevitably die this way, but I did it. There's no guarantee that I can keep this up forever or even for another week, but today gave me hope that I might have it in me.

Edit: I was truly not expecting so many responses dude, thank you all so so much for the nice things you guys have been saying, it means alot :) and for everyone who said they've been clean for around the same time as me, I wish you guys luck from the bottom of my heart, we can do this ❤️‍🩹",52
1,1miidb8,They told me quitting would be the hardest thing I ever did. They were wrong.,anony_mous_person666,154,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1miidb8/they_told_me_quitting_would_be_the_hardest_thing/,"The hardest thing wasn’t the withdrawals.
Wasn’t the nights I shook so bad I couldn’t hold a glass of water.
Wasn’t the cold sweats, the restless legs, or the way my brain screamed for “just one more.”

The hardest thing was facing myself when it was all gone.
No numbing. No escape hatch. Just me. Raw. Ugly. Real.

That’s when I realized recovery isn’t just about stopping. It’s about building.
Building a version of yourself that can’t be broken the same way again.
I still wake up with cravings some days. But now I fight for the life I almost threw away.
If you’re reading this and you’re still in the storm don’t let the storm convince you it’s the whole world.

Some of us crawled out and are leaving maps for the next person.
That’s what I’m doing here.

How do you handle the emptiness after the drugs are gone?",52
2,1lqnn9b,My wife died at 32 from CHS + overprescribed Xanax. Please hear this.,Away-Hippo-8052,153,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1lqnn9b/my_wife_died_at_32_from_chs_overprescribed_xanax/,"I just lost my wife last night.
She was 32 years old.
Beautiful. Brave. Funny as hell, smart, and my best friend. 
Four years clean from heroin. One year sober from alcohol.
Her name was Natasha.

What killed her wasn’t what most people expect.

It was CHS—Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome—made worse by Xanax, overprescribed by a doctor who should have known her history. And it all happened so quietly… until it didn’t.


What CHS Did:

She started vomiting randomly. For hours. Days sometimes.
We thought it was food poisoning. Then anxiety. Then maybe hormones.
Nobody told us weed could do this.
Nobody told us high-THC products can flip on you after years of use.
Nobody warned her that the very thing she thought was helping her… was making her sick.
The first emergency room we went to wouldn't even see us, she was scared and in pain.

What Her Doctor Did:

He prescribed her Xanax for the nausea and sleep.
Not once. Repeatedly.
Even knowing she had a past with benzos and heroin.
Even after we explained how scared we were about her slipping.

And I think…
I think while I was at work, she started using the Xanax more often. Quietly. To sleep. To rest. To escape the pain of vomiting, shaking, losing hope.
And she didn’t tell me.
Because she didn’t want to let me down.


Now I’m Driving Her Car Home. Alone.

She smiled at me the day I left.
I said, “Get better, baby cakey, so we can go on more adventures.”
She smiled and said, “We’ve got so many more to go.” 

But now she’s gone.
And I need you to understand this:

CHS is real.

Long-term weed use can hurt you.

Doctors don’t always listen.

And benzos aren’t harmless.

If you’re fighting this or someone you love is… don’t wait. Speak up. Push back. Taper. Get help. Tell someone.


I’m going to fight to hold the cannabis boards, doctors, and medical systems accountable. But for now, I just needed the world to hear her name. Natasha, please say her name out loud, please. 

She didn’t deserve this.
She deserved a future.
She deserved to be heard.

And if this post saves even one person from the same fate—then her voice still echoes.


Thanks for listening. I’m not okay. But I’m still here.
If you have questions about CHS, addiction, or grief—I’ll answer what I can.",78
3,1hisl61,I'm officially one year clean from opiates!!!,Hatefulthrowawayacc,140,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1hisl61/im_officially_one_year_clean_from_opiates/,"Since I was 16 years old opiates have been a monumental part of my life. I started by taking my mom's old oxys that she would stash for herself. But when that dried up I moved on to Percocets that I would get from my friends at school. The next two years spiraled into a never-ending cat-and-mouse game of me trying to hide my use from the people in my life. I went as far as to intentionally isolate myself from my family and my friends just so I could be alone and nod out for a little while longer. Sadly this habit was never discovered by my parents or any significant figure. I remember this time in my life vividly, and with that, I remember my attitude towards my addiction. The intense denial I was in still makes me say out loud ""What the fuck was I thinking"".

 And then one day in November of 2023 I od'd for the first time. I'll never forget the fear I felt when I found out what happened, in that moment I don't think I couldve spoken if I wanted to, all I could do was cry and hold myself. That was the very first moment I accepted what was wrong with me. I spent the better part of December 2023 detoxing and let me tell you, it was a new circle of hell. I remember thinking to myself that this was worse than active addiction, I could feel every part of my body heating up like I was in the hottest sauna of my life but simultaneously I was shivering and felt an instinctive need to get warm, for lack of a better term it felt like hell froze over. 

That's not me saying the next 11 months were any easier, it wasn't. Every little thing made me think of percs I remember sitting in class and feeling this overpowering urge to get high again. I felt so bad, it felt like every part of my body was tingling with an intense mental and physical pain, a pain that would only be relieved if I just picked up my phone and called my plug. But by some stroke of luck or maybe divine intervention (If you're big into religion) I stayed clean.

 And now here I am, 19 years old and officially one year clean off opiates. I still get those urges from time to time especially if I am bored at the house with nothing to do and I've accepted that this will be a factor that I will deal with for the rest of my life and I'm ok with it, but as I've gone longer and longer without using I've found more and more ways to mentally tell myself NO! Nobody in my life that is significant like my mom or my friends knows this fact about me so I figured this is the best place to share! I still smoke weed, drink and every once in a while I'll do psychedelics with my friends but I made this promise to myself: I will never use opiates for recreational use ever again! And I will do everything in my power to keep that promise no matter what happens.",37
4,1lubuhs,"My brother survived pills, heroin, crack, tranq, and fentanyl. He just became a dad. Please keep him in your prayers.",tommurphyauthor,131,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1lubuhs/my_brother_survived_pills_heroin_crack_tranq_and/,"I’ve watched my brother go through hell.

It started with pills in college, Percs and Xanax at first. Then came heroin. Then crack. Then fentanyl. Then tranq. He’s overdosed at least six times (that we know of). I’ve gotten the calls, the kind that freeze your blood, and somehow, by the grace of God and some incredible doctors and nurses, he survived every one.

For a long time, I didn’t think he’d make it to 30. I’ve seen him steal, lie, disappear, and come back a shell of himself. And yet, he’s still here. Still breathing. Still trying.

And just last month, he became a father.

He still struggles. He’s not “fixed.” But something in him shifted when that baby was born. I saw it in his eyes, like maybe, just maybe, there’s still something worth fighting for.

I wanted to share this not because it’s a perfect ending, it’s not. But because sometimes we need reminders that it’s never too late to turn a new leaf. That the same person who’s burned every bridge can still build something new.

If you pray, I’d ask you to say one for him and his daughter. And if you’re still in the middle of it, still lost in the cycle, please know there’s still hope.

Even now. Especially now.

Austin? Yo austin, you alright???!!! Fuck! Dude, wake up your overdosing. ” i yell into his lifeless, rigid face while slapping him. DUDE WAKE UP. i kick him in the stomach in a panic. A feeling of deep, unadulterated fear hits me like a semi fueled with meth. Fuck! Dude im going to narcan you bro wake the fuck up!! I look for the narcan. Where the fuck!@@@ is the narcan!!!im hyperventilating. In my mind its to late to call 911 its been about 3 minutes. THINK! The car! The narcan is 3 stories down in the hotel parking lot. That might as well be in fucking bangcock. I feel the feeling of death creep into my psyche. This cannot be happening. I think of the phone call to my mom i will have to make.   Everything looked like it was melting. My world was melting. I wish i was never born.

I grab my 2009 satur vue keys and bust through the door then my stomach drops as i almost let the door close without having the room key. That would be instant death for my brother and probably suicide for me if that door closed. I take my shoes and wedge them so it doesnt shut and i fucking run. It was the longest run ill ever have to run. Each step a eternity. Dread filled my nostrils as tears jetted down my sunken face. Run faster you fuck!  I see my dented saturn. I tear apart the dash and grab the narcan. Its august and its hot and its probably 2am and my brother is in our hotel room dying. Ill never talk to him again i thought to myself as i run back through hell. I will never forget the hallway from the stairs to the room. Never-ending regret. I have never felt so helpess and alone. If hell had a feeling. This was it

I ram through the door like a skinny minature tweaker kool aid man. Hes in the same locked up rigamortis position. I get him flat on his back and i pop the narcan and stick it up his stupid nose. I slap him a few times and immediatly start cpr. Fuuuuck austin please dont do this. Please dont leave me here alone on this weird fucked up planet!!! Im crying as i give cpr. I look at his pale blue face and i slap it hard as i can i punch him in the stomach angry and hoping it will trigger something and he wont die. I try dragging him to the shower but alas im not strong enough im screaming for help. It feels like this is a  cruel joke. Where the fuck are you ashton!!@ i continue cpr for probably 10 minutes. I taste blood,our teeth have been colliding and made me bleed. I can taste the taco bell we ate about a hour earlier. Fuck i miss that time era. Right now i would do anything to switch spots with my brother. My little brother is dying. Im giving cpr to my little brother. God please help me. Please dont let him die.  I promise ill be a better bigger brother. Ill get sober and serve you. Please i cant handle this !!@..

Im giving chest compressions, then lift his head up, hoping to open airways. Then the best sound I’ve ever heard graced my ears. Like a hoover vacuum, he took a deep inhale and started choking. I collapse against the wall and look at him while he takes in his surroundings.  “What happened fuck did i overdose?” He says angerly. I nod. He comes over and lifts me up and says ” im so sorry dude i didnt mean to put you through that. Thank you for saving my life” while he hugs me. A wave of relief washes over my body. Over the next hour i almost overdose i was told. I smoked a bunch of fetty trying to get the feelings out of my head. It was two more months of hardcore drug use and debauchery for us to finally go to rehab again. Sorry lord.",30
6,1k3nnbh,Flushed down the toilet..,DripPureLSDonMyCock,98,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1k3nnbh/flushed_down_the_toilet/,"Hey I just wanted to share a success moment. I was looking for something last night in my attic and I came across a bunch of empty sub wrappers. My inner junkie said ""look in them, maybe you left a piece in it!"" I looked and saw there was a half in one. I instantly had a moment of clarity and thought ""dude you're fucking clean now, don't you want to stay that way?? You went through everything to be here right now .. flush it."" I walked downstairs and flushed it. The symbolic part of it was I took a shit earlier and thought I flushed but it didn't actually go down so I dropped the piece in a pile of shit then flushed. Obviously subs played an important role in being sober today but going back out of nowhere to get high is shit. Fuck that. 

I was really proud of myself because situations like that in the past were always my downfall. The lesson learned is to immediately flush it. My first reaction was I put it in the trash and kept looking for something...junkie translation: I'll be back for you later. Have a good one y'all.",27
7,1j2km2o,"I’ve Accepted It. And if you’re sober, you should too.",problyurdad_,97,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1j2km2o/ive_accepted_it_and_if_youre_sober_you_should_too/,"Maybe this will help someone some day. A perspective that has recently came to vision for me and it put a nail in the coffin that is my addiction.       
       
Hi everybody, I’m Problyurdad_, and I’m a heroin addict. I’m going to be 42 years old this year. I first dabbled with heroin back in 2008, the same way many of you did - I got injured at work a few years prior, and was sent home with what should’ve been a ten year supply of opiate pain meds that I burned through in about 4 days (hyperbolic relief, it’s okay to laugh) and turned to the streets when my doctor wouldn’t supply me any more pills, because I wasn’t doing the physical therapy because physical therapy made me feel better and I didn’t want to feel better I wanted pills.            
        
Back then, fentanyl was just starting to rain on heroins parade. Most of the dope we could get our hands on smelled strongly of vinegar, it was light brown, and it made you feel like you were warm and cozy wrapped up in a blanket with a smile on your face. It made you feel good!  It didn’t make you itch. It didn’t make your eyes and nose run. It didn’t give you rosacea. Most of all, it didn’t make you a raging psychopath with wildly unpredictable behavior that you couldn’t remember or control.             
        
In fact, all it ever did was make the day better. I could work harder, faster, longer, and I (thought) I found a drug that finally made me feel great again. Normal, so it seemed. Until the fentanyl started creeping in.       
       
And now, in hindsight, I’m glad it did. Because when I was on heroin cut with fentanyl, I was a much different person. People could tell. I could no longer hide my habit. My behavior was too outlandish. For example, one of my best friends stayed over one night after a concert. He slept on the couch. Before bed I went to the bathroom to shoot up. That’s all I remember. But according to him, I wrapped toilet paper around myself and came back out to the living room and brought it to him as a present. He had to guide me back to my bed. I woke up around 4 am and he wasn’t on the couch and I didn’t know why. He had left after that because he didn’t want to be around it. I don’t blame him.          
          
I went rehab later that summer (2019) and had 5 years of sobriety under my belt before I got the itch to dabble again. And dabble I did, and once again my behavior immediately gave me away. I did things I can’t even tell you because I don’t remember. But my kids saw, my wife saw, and that was the end of that. I dabbled for about a week and then checked right back in to the hospital, never to look back again. Because now I know, and now I am 100% aware, that whatever it is I am looking for from heroin is long gone. Those days are over, and I can’t even get my hands on what I would traditionally say is my drug of choice, the experience I’m seeking, the feelings I’m trying to feel….         
        
If you’re thinking about using again, don’t. Whatever it is you’re looking for isn’t there anymore. The experience you want is long gone. You’re not going to be able to hide it, and it’s not going to be what you have in your head as an idea for it anyways. It’ll be way different and the only thing you’ll gain from it is experience, and another time you wish you hadn’t picked it back up again. Trust me. I know. ",25

The pain, the sweats, the hell in my bones but nobody told me what comes after.
The silence. The way the world feels too bright, too loud, too empty all at the same time. Everyone else goes back to “normal” but you’re stuck learning how to breathe again without a crutch.

I don’t want pity, I just want to say this out loud: recovery isn’t just quitting the drug, it’s rebuilding the pieces of yourself you burned away. That part feels just as hard some days.

11,1i954eh,7 hydroxymitragynine made me go backwards in my recovery,No-Move1994,85,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1i954eh/7_hydroxymitragynine_made_me_go_backwards_in_my/,"This is about 7-oh. I was about 96 hours sober from heroin. I was actually feeling pretty good besides the back pain. No other symptoms other than back pain. I made a post in here about having back pain and someone recommended 7-oh, so I got a pack of pills. 


I took one last night and I felt fucking fantastic, pure bliss. I took another this morning and felt great..it last about 4 hours. It worked great... Too great, but when I woke up I realized I woke up sicker with withdrawal symptoms that I thought had went away. 

Did deeper research this morning and come to find out, it doesn't just work like an opioid, IT IS AN OPIOID. No different than heroin, percs, morphine, etc. so after it wore off I felt more dope sick than before. So not only is it an opioid, it's 22x stronger than morphine and 4x stronger than heroin. It literally took me back to day 1 of my detox, except the withdrawals were way worse than before. 

Update: I got a bag of H last night. But I don't consider it a relapse... More like a reset. Give those stupid pills enough time to get out my system, just a week, and then stop again. I can handle heroin withdrawals anytime, but the withdrawal I felt from those 7oh pills were just completely unbearable. I couldn't function at all. 


So just putting this here to warn others. Don't take it unless you've completely detoxed from your DOC.

I was recently banned from the subreddit for brining up the fact that it has a lot of religious reference and mention of god, as well as congratulating someone who posted about being clean from hard drugs while still smoking weed and sharing my own situation.

The moderation team made it explicitly clear that it is not a place for questioning their own narrative and have no qualms about silencing someone who goes against their own status quo.

I was told that, as a member of NA for 10+ years and someone who was born and raised within the rooms that I was not welcome there.

I mentioned how their ban actually violated their own rules and they proceeded to mute me.

I’m sharing this as a warning because all it takes is one power tripping mod to shun away a struggling person and they could end up triggering a relapse causing someone to overdose.

In fact I will be writing to the narcotics anonymous head office to lodge a complaint about an online community using the Narcotics anonymous name in an unfortunate way and it sends a bad message to any would be newcomer that maybe they would get kicked out of the in person rooms too if they said the wrong thing.",70

It's incredible how much my life has changed since I made the plunge to drop everything I was doing and asked my parents if I could stay with them while I completely quit outright. Man that was a solid 2 weeks a real shake rattle and roll followed by another 2 months of just generally feeling shitty but still I was excited. I spent my entire adult life a lying piece of shit junkie so at 31 I was completely unsure of where to start or what to do except stay off dope. At 7 months clean I successfully moved out of my parents to a city I always wanted to move to and did is the right way. But something unexpected happened. I met someone I wanted to start a family with so we eventually moved back to where I was from and got us a cute little house just a bit from Lake Michigan. I thought life couldn't have been better, like I never thought I'd be spending my days after work loading up the car with a cooler and my sweetheart and driving to the beach for an evening swim. You miss out on that shit when you're spending your time after work hustling up more money for a bag or chasing shitty d-boys around town ya know?

And it's not like there's been no bumps and it hasn't been hard as fuck a lot of time it really has but I just react differently to it now. I also got to mention the gratitude that a person has after getting clean. It's seriously unreal. Like every single thing is amplified in how good it feels knowing I was so close to never having that joy ever again. I really thought heroin addiction would kill me and resigned myself to it for a while as most of us do right? Well don't resign yet. Ain't no age too old, ain't no such thing as too late unless you're dead.

I would argue that the process itself—the act of contacting a dealer, meeting them at a designated location, acquiring the drugs, and returning home—can be just as addictive. There is something inherently thrilling to the human brain in engaging in activities we know are illegal, yet manage to execute without detection, evading the government’s reach. This illicitness creates a sense of euphoria in itself.

I have heard of countries such as Portugal and cities like Amsterdam, where drug use has been decriminalized, and interestingly, abuse rates are lower compared to when substances were criminalized. The thrill that comes with the illegality of the act seems to be a significant factor in the addiction; when drugs are legalized, that thrill diminishes, making the substance itself less enticing. Additionally, there is a certain euphoria associated with the ability to acquire what one desires when so many are disconnected from access, unable to obtain what they need when they need it.",63

I remember reading posts on this sub when I was in the first weeks of recovery, posts like this seemed impossible. It's not. Life is beautiful. 

Happy New Year.",26
19,1hjy5e0,This is the best time of year to be sober,LonnieJay1,72,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1hjy5e0/this_is_the_best_time_of_year_to_be_sober/,"I've spent plenty Christmases hooked on opioids or otherwise struggling to stay off them. I remember feeling like such a fucking loser as everyone gave and received gifts, while I sat there with my stingy ass little gifts for a few people. I felt so uncomfortable with the small talk and the nice clothes, it was all just unbearable 

Going into Christmas with all my shopping done already, the gifts for my daughter and extended family already wrapped, and ready to host my girls family on Christmas Eve feels great. I feel like I'm actually capable of getting ahead of life sometimes, which is a feeling I never had while I was using opioids

I'm able to be responsible, which feels better than any drug ever did. Seven years ago on Christmas I was in detox for a polydrug IV habit and ready to ice myself. For anyone who is struggling and doesn't see a light at the end of the tunnel, i can tell you that it is there",11
20,1in1pgt,I OD’d yesterday. I’m done with opiates.,MarketingUpbeat8836,71,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1in1pgt/i_odd_yesterday_im_done_with_opiates/,"The inevitable happened to me yesterday.

I overdosed. I’ve only been using a few months, only using dillies. I picked up a bad batch yesterday unknowingly, didn’t get my shit tested. I went down hard. Luckily there were people around that noticed. I stopped breathing for 10 minutes, went completely purple. They did CPR and narcaned me 5 times before I woke up. I woke up incredibly confused and upset. Got taken to the hospital via ambulance, threw up everything in my stomach. 

I’m alive. And I’m so fucking grateful to have woken up this morning. I’m hoping there are no long-term consequences to my brain after being out for 10 minutes. This sounds silly but I always thought it would never happen to *me*. That it was just something that happened to hardcore users.

In the ambulance on the way to the hospital, I took out the rest of my supply and gave it to the paramedics, and I said, I’m done. I can’t do this anymore. I’ve been hiding this secret for months, it’s so exhausting. I was so close to dying yesterday, and I’m only 24. I deserve to live a long, healthy life. So I’m done. Today is day one of sobriety.

I checked into detox in before Christmas and never looked back . I was so desperate to get off Kratom where I was  constantly fiending for a fix that I had no choice but to use subuxone to help weene off and it worked . 

I was prescribed 2 mg 3 times a day but I only took one film once a day then I started tapering throughout the span of 4 months I moved down to 1 mg then .50 then .25 . I was experiencing withdrawals at .25 and I finally said fuck it let me skip a dose and I felt fine . Here I am 5 days off subuxone and I never felt better .Although I’m experiencing small side effects like body pain and flu like symptoms I feel amazing mentally . It’s almost like I’m feeling better than before ,I’m actually quite amazed at the transformation . I thought i would struggle like I did after quitting Kratom but I was wrong .Im feeling better and better each day and like my old self .

Any of you struggling out there , there is hope .. You will find the light at the end up to the tunnel .. I was severely depressed ,I thought I’d never feel better . Keep fighting guys .

Any advice from this point is appreciated ..Good luck  everyone .

It’s been a long journey. Using for years, hitting my rock bottom, then somehow finding the light at the end of the tunnel to make the leap towards recovery. My life has done a complete 180 in this past year. I’m officially going back to school to get my bachelors degree so I can become a drug addiction counselor to turn a dark chapter in my life into something positive. My depression, anxiety, and agoraphobia have improved so much. I’m in my first healthy relationship and today marks six months. I’m waiting to hear back from a job I applied for and from the last two interviews it seems promising. 
I would have never been able to achieve these things while I was using. If anyone out there is struggling with addiction just know there’s always hope. I truly thought I was a lost cause and now I feel like a whole different person. Never give up. 💖",25

It wasn’t easy, it wasn’t cheap and it wasn’t traditional getting here, but life on the other side is worth it. He looks more full of life, the dark circles under his eyes are gone, he is a better father, husband and son. 

I want to let you know you can do this! There is hope and life without pain killers is beautiful, not boring. If you are a wife or if you have a spouse struggling, know you are not alone. 

Today I started a new community or “sub” to spread awareness and stories on quitting. It’s for addicts of all kind. If you could join that would be awesome. I want to use it as sort of a diary for us all. 

I want to edit this post to end some confusion, he is NOT on Kratom either. He is clean from both. Kratom ended up being worse than the opiate addiction itself. If you are thinking of ending your opiate addiction with Kratom, do yourself a favor and stay away! You do not want to be in that hole.

Get your ass into the clinic and start dosing and get your life back. Suboxone is a great medication for people addicted to opiates that AREN'T Fentanyl because Fent gets stored in your fat and therefore is sending people into PWD who have waited 4-5 days. It's not worth the gamble when Methadone is a full agonist and therefore doesn't cause this issue. I will say that it sucks pecker having to drive to the clinic every day in the beginning while you establish trust and hand in enough clean drug tests to get take homes. If you have been going for long enough and haven't failed any drug screens (minus weed) you will get take homes. Call u your local clinic and see if they take insurance AND if they do and you don't have any, your counselor should be able to give you some resources :)",90
26,1hwv1f7,"Threw almost four years clean down the drain. Put some sense into my fucking head

",Ok_Intention6827,64,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1hwv1f7/threw_almost_four_years_clean_down_the_drain_put/,"Back in 2020, I went to rehab after a year long OC80 habit. At the end I ate three to four of those blue fuckers a day, it was terrible. I did the whole nine yards: got clean, moved cities, went to university, got a prestigious internship and finished my bachelors thesis with highest grades. All great, everybody so proud, but all along I was feeling like shit. I was young when I went to rehab, and I was in such a rush to get out in the world and prove everybody wrong that I didn't gave two fucks about what caused my addictive behaviour.

Some months back, in June, I started taking benzodiazepines, I guess it was for anxiety symptoms. i never did it to get high, only in normal doses per se. Don't think I've ever taken over 40mg diazepam over 24 hrs. I made a deal with myself: hand in your bachelor thesis in December, then seek help. And that's what I did. I'm in the midst of a taper with my local addiction center, and on that front it's great something is being done. They might even offer me some therapy.

A few weeks back, although, life took unexpected turns. I was crushed, emotionally and financially. I bought an OC80, did 40mg, saved 40mg for the day after and nodded the fuck out for two days. The warm blanket felt exactly the way I remembered it. I know why I did it, but I regret it just as much as taking that first benzo back in June.

It was in the mid of December, today is January 8th, and I just did it for I think the tenth time or something like that. The 20mg don't get me nodding anymore, 40mg barely does. I can go two to three days, sensing no withdrawals, but then I do them again. As mentioned, this has been going on for some weeks.

I went to this sub for so much advice, support and comfort back in 2020 and 2021 when I was in active addiction and in my recovery phase. Now I'm on the steps of a nasty oxy habit again. Apparently, I can't get into my head what it is I'm doing. I did around 50mg tonight, and I plan of doing the rest. It will be the last pill, but I said that the last time and the last time again.

This may sound so fucking dumb, but please, someone, remind me why we don't do this shit. Remind me why this is the direct pathway to misery. Remind that I'm better than this. Remind me there's still a turning point without going through the whole nine yards again. I'm not sure I can do that.

27,1klt4qp,I FOUND a legitimate malindkroft fentanyl hcl patch while walking to the grocery store today.,insyzygy322,61,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1klt4qp/i_found_a_legitimate_malindkroft_fentanyl_hcl/,"Just last week I was thinking about how im now far enough away from my last sublocade injection that I could probably break through it with fent. 

However, I've never done street fent, and never plan on it. I was a pharma opi to real heroin addict, through and through. 

With that being said, I used to smoke gel fent patches back in the day. Wasn't my fav, but it when it was available, I used it. 

Hadn't thought about fent patches in a very long time.. until last week.. when I had this thought 'hey, you don't fuck with street 'fent', and that's good.. but imagine if it was the year 200x and you had access to fent patches. Wouldn't that be cooooool?'

The absolute shock when I reached down at the end of my block and picked up a sealed malindkroft 25 mcg/hr patch.. MAN. 

It felt trippy. Like, the universe whispering in my ear.

""Here, want to try? Try.""

Not even a fucking ounce of desire once it was in my hand. 

Immediately walked down to the encampment down the block and gave it away.. couldn't exactly bring myself to destroy it. Technically harm reduction for someone smoking street fent lol

What a trip. Hadn't seen one of those in over a decade. Never thought I'd see them again. 

Feels liberating, in a way. I don't even regret it now that I've calmed down. I've had some past experiences where I ditch a substance in these sorts of scenarios and regret it deeply like 10 mins later. 

Truly a trip

Edit:

Thanks so much for the love, everybody! I have a tendency to invalidate myself, and really didn't even see it as an 'accomplishment' of any sort until y'all convinced me it was. 

Something inside of me fights me hard when I attempt to be proud of myself, but I'll keep doing my best to recognize that my actions were a manifestation of years and years of hard work. I didn't just 'not have desire to use it'. 

Much love 🫶 ",30

30,1libd6j,Opiate withdrawal,Economy_Succotash751,55,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1libd6j/opiate_withdrawal/,"I asked chatgpt to write a description of what withdrawals felt like. It understood the assignment...

Opiate withdrawal is a deeply physical and emotional ordeal — a storm that tears through the body and mind with brutal clarity. It often begins like the onset of a severe flu, but it quickly escalates into something more punishing and unrelenting.

In the beginning, there's a creeping unease, a gnawing sense that something is wrong. The body feels tense, wired with nervous energy. Anxiety starts to rise, like a drumbeat in the chest, accompanied by yawning, watery eyes, and a runny nose. These may seem minor at first, but they signal the opening notes of the full symphony of suffering to come.

As hours pass, restlessness sets in. Muscles ache, deep in the bones — not like soreness from overuse, but a crawling, burning tightness that won’t be soothed. The skin feels too tight and too sensitive all at once. People often describe it as feeling like ants are crawling beneath their skin, or like their body is trying to tear itself out from the inside.

The gastrointestinal system turns traitor. Nausea churns in the stomach. Cramps twist the gut with merciless precision. Diarrhea becomes relentless. Appetite vanishes. Vomiting may begin. It feels as though the body is purging itself, desperate to rid itself of toxins, but in doing so, it strips away comfort, control, and dignity.

Sleep becomes impossible. The body is exhausted but won’t rest. Every attempt to lie still is disrupted by chills that shake the spine, followed by waves of sweating that leave the sheets drenched. Legs twitch uncontrollably — restless leg syndrome becomes maddening. It's like trying to sleep while being electrocuted from the inside out.

Psychological distress builds alongside the physical. Anxiety intensifies into panic. Depression creeps in like a heavy fog. Thoughts become chaotic, dark, and hopeless. Cravings claw at the brain, screaming for relief, for the drug that could silence this pain. There's a profound sense of despair — not just over the withdrawal, but over the realization of how tightly the drug has coiled itself around every system in the body.

Time distorts. Hours feel like days. Every second is felt acutely. There's no distraction strong enough to cut through the agony. Some people cry. Some rage. Some stare blankly, barely able to speak.

Eventually, the storm begins to ease — but the emotional weight may linger long after the physical symptoms subside. Guilt, shame, fear of relapse, and a shattered sense of self often remain. Even in the calm, the memory of withdrawal haunts like a ghost.

Opiate withdrawal isn’t just discomfort. It’s a full-body rebellion, a psychological unraveling — and for many, a terrifying glimpse into how powerfully these substances have taken hold. But with support, safety, and care, recovery is possible. Even from this.

31,1jciegw,"Life of a kid born in the 80s, addiction and where it got me.",prospectxpwy,56,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1jciegw/life_of_a_kid_born_in_the_80s_addiction_and_where/,"I remember being really little when my older brother found our dad's HS Yearbook in our grandma's basement in NYC.  I remember him opening it and seeing all these written messages inside and I think it mighta been the first time I had even seen a yearbook.  All the messages said things like What's up Ganja _____ STAY HIGH my brother, your best friend.  Or ""I'll never forget the first time tripping with you"" or ""Signed, the ______ bar boyzzz"" CHEERS!  My brother was laughing n so excited reading it like HOLY SHIT I can't believe this is dad's!  We grew up hearing about the trippy 60s, the art, how drugs were such an influential part of that era.  

Growing up, it seemed like any movie kids wanted to see in the 90s- and did - romanticized tf outta drugs.  Every time someone smoked, popped a pill, hit a vein, the cinematics would intensify n it'd usually be attached to something very emotional or powerful in the movie.  Almost every kid I knew, I'd heard say, ""I'd try that once if I could"".  Well, I was raised very strict and though my parents drank at parties, I never saw any drugs at the parties.  By the time I was 12, I was smoking cigarettes, as were most of my friends (strangely, it was kinda normal for kids to go through adults coats for cigs at a party even at that age, we'd try to hide it but it was almost like ""looks like the kids found some cigarettes they're smoking out there"").  Even into the 2000s some movies, especially about teens, the whole basis of the movie would be how they were getting x, y, z for a party or for whatever.  Soon after, I tried weed.  Then I got my first bf who was a huge drinker n he was older.  I began drinking daily.  

The house in my neighborhood that we used to chill at was full of teens n young 20s in n out non stop, all my friends, all way older than me.  The dude who lived there's mom was almost never there n when she did get there she did crack in her room n didn't seem to notice or care that her son had turned her house into the equivalent of an illegal drug den, I mean, we graffitid artwork all over her fkn walls...  When she was friendly which was rare, it was usually cuz we were holding something she wanted.

My freshmen year in HS was absolute hell.  I was finally out from under my parents very tight watch and I just remember being angry all the time at every fkn adult that had something to say to me in that building.  Almost daily the deans would pull me in the office, go thru my backpack, steal all my sharpies n paint markers n spray paint.  Graffiti was a huge part of my life at the time and I was the only girl I knew who went bombing n they just kept taking all my shit. I remember how I felt when he'd open my new pack of Newports and break them all in front of me over the garbage while barking at me and I was INFURIATED.  I'd walk out every time, meet up w my bf n start drinking.  They kept kicking me out of every hs I went to cuz I never went.  I was now at that drug house drinking from 7am to midnight every day.  Doing every drug that came through.  Never went to Sophomore year, just dropped out n kept going to that house every day.  It was only a few blocks from where I lived.

Then my bf went on vacation with his family but I kept going there cuz all my ""friends"" were there.  They had been scheming and I had noooooo fkn clue, what a stupid little girl.  The first day my bf was gone I remember this tall guy who was half black half Italian n had always seemed like one of the more normal dudes who'd only come thru once in a while....he was walkin towards the house w a huge bottle of vodka and I was sitting on the porch w my 22oz Heineken.  He said wow!  Thank God you're here, I got this for you!  Which was suspicious at first n I was like why?  And he said remember that night last week?  You gave me so many of your Heinekens and cigs so I got you this to repay you.  I figured he just stole it for me n I was like alright cool thx.  He said, I'll brb I'm just gonna run in n make myself a quick drink, I gotta go, you can have the rest.  

I don't know what happened after that first sip but I woke up and I couldn't move.  I opened my eyes and I was in a house I'd never been in before laying on someone's couch and the room was full of men, wall to wall.  I was naked.  They put a dropper in my mouth n I went black again.  I was kidnapped, raped repeatedly.  Somehow didn't end up pregnant or sick with anything.  It was the biggest secret in the neighborhood and every guy knew, soon their gfs were finding out ""I had fkd their man"".  I got into so many fkn fights, couldn't go anywhere in my neighborhood, fought nearly every girl I ever knew.  But I was too something ... scared..  proud... fkd in the head to tell anyone what really happened those 3 days.

That was the breaking point I think.  I was determined to be as numb as possible at all times cuz I had nobody to talk to about this, I didn't know what to do.  And, tbh I felt like a pos, like trash, disposable, to be used n discarded.  Around that time I just started going to bars and clubs every night.  Made new friends, got more fucked up, bounced all over NYC til 4 am every morning.  I had fun, so many good times, but plenty of pretty bad ones too.  Then, sometime while I was still doing what I was doing I got into a really bad car accident.  My doctor prescribed me Oxy 30s 3x a day.  I finally found my FAVORITE drug.  Kept running out he kept giving more, more, more.  Until one day I show up and he says I'm sorry, I can still give you the spinal shots but the meds you were on I can only give to cancer patients now.  I was pretty angry about it tbh cuz these pills on the street weren't cheap n I had a HABIT and a fkn half.  I decided whatever I'll just get them if I see someone has em, guess I can't have em every day anymore.  I was at a friend's house when all the sudden I thought I was dying, I panicked and told my friends something was wrong.  They were asking a million questions and I remember mumbling something about stopping the pills n maybe that's why and one guy was like OXY?  YOU'RE IN WITHDRAWAL!  YOU COULD FKN DIE!  YOUR DR DIDN'T GIVE YOU ANYTHING?  SUBOXONE?  I didn't even know what a suboxone was bro I was so like, uninformed about this shit.  I just knew I was gonna die that night and I layed down.  Not even 5 mins later the same guy comes in the bedroom n he's like you sniff coke?  And I'm like yeah u got?  He's like no, sniff this n you'll feel better.  That's ALLLLLL I had to hear I didn't care if it was rat poison just make me feel like I'm NOT dying PLEASE.  It was heroin.

So, I replaced the pills with sniffing heroin.  All I knew in my empty stupid head was keep doing this at all costs, you won't die.  I became his dealer's top custy.  For years I always kept a tight circle of dope friends.  I had met a girl who I got along with for once.  We became best buddies, basically did everything together, tried to quit together at a Methadone clinic, kept using.  By that time I was using needles.  We both got to a point that it was getting really hard to find a vein that worked anymore.  She got a bad infection in her right arm and it was bad enough she was hardly able to move her arm.  I kept telling her she had to get it seen cuz it looked really bad but since it was always covered I'd forget about it then realize again and ask if she went to the dr yet and I really don't know why she wouldn't just go to the hospital n let them patch it up, fix it, whatever had to be done.  But we were on a constant chase for dope and it just took a backseat, one day right as I dropped her off in front of her house, she said something to me, that for the first time ever, since I knew her, made me mad and not just mad, but I peeled out off her block as she was holding her stomach.  3 hrs later she texted ""I'm in the hospital call me plz"" and I guess I assumed she was at the ER for her arm but I remember just throwing my phone back on my bed like fk u bitch I've been saying let's go for months now you decided to go the day you pissed me tf off?  Get fkd 🖕

She was dead by the morning.  Sepsis.  I lost my fkn mind.  The guilt.  The only female friend I ever cared about is dead and it's my fault.  I was so consumed with my bs that I didn't just make the appointment for her like a good friend n take her.  And my last words to her before she died was ""good, u dumb bitch, keep letting him rob u then, I'm not saving you next time your shit is gone"".  

She had no family at all but one sister who had written her off eons ago.  I called n told her that her sister had died and she said good and hung up.  She had absolutely nothing, nobody, that cared but me.  I was her emergency contact in the hospital.  I did the best I could with what I could, paid for everything I had to, got her ashes.  I couldn't stop crying for weeks, so many regrets, so much pain, there wasn't any amount of now, fent - that would stop my eyes from puddling up constantly.  I sat in my childhood bedroom again, a total mess.  Surrounded by ashtrays, bottles, needles, stamp bags all around me.  I stayed in bed killing myself slowly, and paying a high price to do it.  In my head for some reason I was thinking I had only been doing dope for 10 yrs.  I stayed alone for 3 yrs for the most part, couldn't enjoy partying anymore.  Every day I hoped I'd get a bag they measured wrong or something and I could just be at peace.

Then one day I got a phone call from this really cool kid I had met at rehab once.  He was the only one not trying to get in my pants and we had a great time in rehab together, so I picked up.  He said hey and asked how I was n he told me he was 5 yrs clean.  He was off the streets and in college.  It didn't even sound anything like the guy I remembered.  He was in the rooms, doing the work and doing a good job.  He kept begging me to make a meeting n I was stubborn.  But I finally decided after the new year I'd get clean.  He kept checking in on me n it helped me stick to my plan.  So I went for it when the time came.  I was so tired of feeling sad, so tired of paying to kill myself slowly.  I didn't have the balls to jump off my roof.  I had already tried.

I knew I didn't wanna be back in that methadone clinic w all the dope dealers outside n everyone still using and I had read about the Bernese method and just said, it's time.  I was pasted to my bed for 9 days, truly thought I might die but I didn't even care, I was NEVER touching that garbage again, no matter what it took.  I feel like all I kept saying to myself was ""tomorrow it'll be 5% better"".  I must have said it a thousand times and I finally fell asleep that 9th night.  I woke up and I could sit.  It was over.  I smiled so big and looked up, and thanked my friend.  I love you so much. I'm so sorry I didn't do the right thing. Thank you, God, I love you.  I cried tears of pure joy for the first time in my life.  It was so powerful, the only thing I could imagine could be like what I was feeling was giving birth.  I was SO HAPPY.  SO HOPEFUL.  I don't think I had ever felt real hope before that.  

Today is my 36th day off fent, subs, and every other pos garbage I can think of.  Thanks for reading, if anyone bothers to.  

You'll never be able to succeed until you're ready...it's true.  Until you've really just become so disgusted with yourself and your life that you can push through it.  My best friend died in '22 and it's '25.  Once I got clean I realized I had been on dope not for 10 yrs, but 22.  Please, look for a sign, look for hope.  Go to a meeting.  This has changed my life in such an enormous way.  All I ever remember knowing my entire life was pain.  I can finally feel again.  When I talk to my nephews, I can feel their joy and it makes my heart smile.  I promise you.  It's better on this side.

I still drive by that drug house multiple times a week.  Neighborhoods change, people change, even the house looks a bit spruced up and every time I see that family on the porch or going into the house, I thank God that they have no idea how much young laughter happened in that house as we all were killing ourselves.  My biggest regret is that my friend, my best friend that I ever had, had to die before seeing that life could be beautiful.  All we needed to do was stop looking for it in the wrong place.

I just started going to my local methadone clinic, and I find it extremely idiotic that they require you to go every single fucking day for years. And it's not just the issue of going but also waiting 1 to 3 hours each day (at least in my area). This is completely absurd—I don't know how anyone would be able to hold a job while having to attend the BS clinic every day. I can only conclude that the U.S. doesn't actually want to stop this ""opioid epidemic"" and that these centers are just there to make a profit, not to help.

For context, in my home country (Colombia), you only need to see a primary physician, usually a toxicologist, who will prescribe a month's supply of methadone that you just need to pick up at your local pharmacy. And this is the way it’s done in a lot of other countries. Mind you, Colombia is supposedly ""third world,"" and even so, paying for both the physician and the medication will only run you about $100 per month.

With all this in mind, I ask: Are there any plans to update these outdated and backward-ass regulations in the U.S. regarding methadone? Are these regulations coming from the government, or are they up to the methadone clinics’ discretion? Is anyone doing anything about this? And if not what would you recommend me to do, because I definately do not intent to keep wasting 2 hours each day (more than I wait on my dealer) and spending nearly as much as I did in dope.

This has been the toughest war with my own mind I’ve experienced yet. Doing this all on my own without any outside support from anyone at all has been a significant challenge.

The only really good news is that I no longer feel sick. The bad news is that dealing with the post acute symptoms is harder than the initial 2 week sickness. I have terribly low energy & lack the motivation to really do anything at all. I’m also trying to be comfortable with being more bored than I’ve ever been. Yet everyday I sit here and daydream about rebuilding my life, meeting new people and building new connections, but I lack the get up and go to even start. 

I know that asking how long this will persist is like asking how long is a piece of string, but I’m just so desperate for the old me to return, the energetic, outgoing, sociable & hard working me. I went from a guy who never took a day off to struggling to even maintain hygiene. I’m positive hormones are contributing to this, probably low testosterone. If so, would a doctor prescribe it to me, or just tell me to wait for it to return to base level naturally? 

Anyway, the 24 days closing on a month is somewhat of an achievement I guess. But more importantly I’m desperate to not waste any more time after three years of isolation so any advice on what I should expect for the near future regarding low energy & low mood in general would be much appreciated. 

Summer is coming up & I just want to feel somewhat normal again.

I’ve been there. I’ve sat on the edge of the bed, sweating, shaking, crying, praying for it to stop — but also praying I don’t go back to using.
I’ve been that dude who thought I was too far gone.

I’ve lost people I love — one recently took their own life — and I ain’t gonna lie, it messed me up bad.
I still deal with chronic pain every single day. I still got demons that whisper in my ear.

Still fighting.
Still refusing to go back.

It helps with my anxiety and pain. It keeps me grounded.
Some people won’t agree, and that’s okay.
But it keeps me alive and off the poison that once had me chained.

I still count myself clean because I don’t use to escape anymore — I use it to cope and function, not to disappear.

Getting clean ain’t about being perfect.
It’s about surviving long enough to heal.

You don’t need to have your life figured out.
You don’t need to have a degree, a job, or a support system.
You just need that one thing — the desire to stop dying and start living again.

That’s the spark.
That’s what saved me when nothing else could.

To the PhD who’s popping pills in secret, and to the kid who dropped out and is nodding off in a trap house — I see you.
You both deserve recovery.
You both deserve peace.
You both deserve to look in the mirror and not hate who you see.

Don’t let fear of withdrawals or fear of life keep you from the freedom you deserve.
Yeah, it’s gonna hurt. Yeah, it’s gonna suck.
But that pain? It’s temporary.
And on the other side of it is something you might’ve forgotten existed — hope.

You’re not weak for being scared.
You’re strong as hell for even thinking about changing.

If you’re reading this, it means you still got fight in you.
And that’s enough for today.

One day at a time.
Keep pushing.
Keep breathing.
You’re not alone in this.

I've been severely addicted to both drugs. At my worst I was on 40mg Xanax per day, and I've also been addicted to IV heroin. I think opioid withdrawals are worse because of how many debilitating symptoms there are. 

With benzo withdrawal, the only symptoms I'd experience were anxiety, paranoia, insomnia, depression, and sometimes migraines. I know that sounds like a lot, and don't get me wrong, this all was terrible and could sometimes make me feel crazy, but that was pretty much it. All the symptoms seemed to stem from anxiety. I never had vivid hallucinations, never had a seizure (was on anti-seizure meds), and even at my worst I could still function 1 day completely off benzos if I replaced them with soma or pregabalin. 

Whereas with opioid withdrawal, there's so many symptoms that drive me nuts. The yawns, sweats, flu-like symptoms, RLS, anxiety, depression, diarrhea, puking, insomnia, fatigue, and the CRAVINGS. I'd get decent cravings when going through benzo withdrawals, but they were pretty easily alleviated if I just used soma or pregabalin. Whereas there's nothing that can really subside the cravings I get for opiates. It feels like nothing else matters at the time. 

I'm 9 days completely tapered off benzos for the first time in 6 years, and I have no cravings for the stuff. I rarely think about it, and when I do it's just me being happy that I don't have to use the crap anymore. ",115

For me I enjoyed about the first month of it, then the last 4 years was hell. Chasing the dragon everyday for a feeling I would never come close to again. On top of that, you have to hide it. From loved ones, from your job, from everything. Everyone is afraid of the withdrawal, I went through fent withdrawal more time than I can count and always went back to it to scratch that itch. If you want off the shit, I’m telling you, find a way to get on suboxone, then get on sublocade. Whether that’s through a rehab, Medicaid/insurance, etc. Or find a way that ACTUALLY works for you.
People will say they can’t do it, and I understand. It’s hard to put life on hold. But eventually we all gotta come to terms with the reality we’re living. Spending all of that money on bunk shit most of the time, unless you are one of the rare people with a fire plug with good prices. Regardless, it’s not worth it. I keep seeing people on here asking questions about this and that regarding fentanyl. Just stop. Stop doing the shit to yourself. Start working out and developing healthy habits. Smoke weed. Use nicotine. Anything to get off that demon, and that’s exactly what fentanyl is, a demon.

Isn’t that kind of ironic? We’re all here because opiates wrecked our lives in one way or another. None of us should be casting stones. The fact that people feel the need to shut down someone’s experience just because it doesn’t line up with the “accepted” recovery path is awful.

Not everyone’s recovery looks the same. Some people thrive on MAT, others don’t. That doesn’t make their story less valid.

I get the mindset, I think, rip the bandaid off, suffer through it, earn your stripes. But I honestly don’t understand why you’d want to go full CT when your body and brain are already completely wrecked from opiates.

Like… you're already sleep-deprived, depressed, in pain, dopamine’s on vacation, your nervous system’s fried..Why make it harder than it already is?

I'm not talking about going on MAT or trading one thing for another. I'm just asking:
Is there any real benefit to making it as brutal as possible?
What’s the upside?

Is it about pride? Feeling “cleaner”? Punishment?
Or is it just not knowing there are other ways?

Not saying CT doesn’t work. I know it does for some.
But if you're already mentally and physically hanging by a thread… why add gasoline to the fire?

Genuinely asking out of interest.
Maybe there’s something I’m missing. Not here to argue! Just trying to understand what drives people to choose CT over other options.





Just to be clear this post wasn’t about sharing my story, I was just curious how people did it cold turkey (no MAT, no kratom, no psilocybin).

I personally used kratom, psilocybin and other natural supplements and vitamins to get off oxy, heroin and benzos, so I’m not claiming I did it without help.

I’m almost 14 months clean now and don’t use anything anymore — just smoke some weed and trip on shrooms 2–3 times a year.
Feel free to keep sharing your experiences! some of them are mind blowing!

I just want wanted to write to you all.

I am 14 years clean today. I have no one to tell, because no one in my life really knows I ever used. I did heroin for 3 years, averaged a gram and half a day, IV. This was right before fentanyl came into the scene.

I quit cold turkey one day. I laid in my mom’s bed for days, the bone pain and restless legs is what I remember most. My hair was matted by the end of it, I ended up hospitalized later in the month due to some electrolyte problems.  I never went on mat medicine.  I understand some need it, but I didn’t want to have to get off something else.

I’ve never relapsed. I left everyone I knew in that scene behind. I became friends with people who didn’t do hard drugs (I didn’t think that was possible). My life is just a life, nothing special. I never went back to college. I’m doing okay. I still have dreams that I use once or twice a year, but it’s fine.

I guess what I’m saying is, keep going if you’re struggling. My life is so much better not feeling sick every other day because the dealer is out or worrying where I’ll get my stuff from . That alone keeps me clean, that was the worst experience in my life.

It gets easier, I promise.

Love to you all.",8

I (24f) am 6 months sober after 5 years of opiate use and 4+ years of addiction prior to that. I’m so jealous of people who've built a beautiful little life for themselves with friends they love and have known for years and full of things they love doing and a sense of home and community and wonder. Who know what they like to do for fun and see people regularly that they know and care about. Have passions and interests and goals and plans for the future and what they want to do even if that's just more of whatever little things they enjoy. 

I feel so lost, I don’t have anything I like in my life and have wasted so many years losing any kind of joy and now I just have to be here??? And figure it out??? Find shit that l like doing when I've spent so long hating everything and doing nothing and talking to no one?? I've ruined like 95% of the relationships and opportunities l've had and I just have to start from scratch now? So many other people who did drugs that Ive talked to at least had something to go back to in their life.

what am I supposed to do with all this nothing???? I am so full of nothing and my life is full of nothing and I can't stop doing nothing and wanting nothing. Like great now I want more in theory, but what does that do for me right now besides make it more painful to have nothing??? And I don't enjoy anything. I can't think of anything I want to actually do. I give myself a goal and I get there and it's like- great, now what? It doesn't mean anything. I'm completely alone and I don't care. Why should I care about my life marginally improving when there's no one to share it with and it feels completely meaningless.

I think of my future and it's like this- I could go finish high school/get my ged, go to college, move away, but I don't actually find any hope in the idea. Then I'd just be in school, still hopeless. I'd just be somewhere else, still me, life still bleak. I got my drivers license finally, got promoted, am trying to talk to people more, make an effort, reach out- but it all feels so empty and trite. It doesn't mean anything to me, I can't connect with anyone, I don't know anyone. When I talk to people it's forced. I don't have anyone I speak candidly with. it's going to take so much work and I don't have the energy, yeah I know I can eventually get there but what am I supposed to do until then and how long exactly is it going to take?
I don’t really fully believe it’s possible for me. I’ve always struggled with or had complicated relationships with people, I’ve been mentally ill since I was a young teenager, and I’ve never gotten over anything that’s ever happened in my life, and now all of a sudden I’m an adult who can’t cope without hard drugs, flooded with everything I never dealt with and this horrible constant void of loss in my chest, with absolutely nothing to look forward to, no light at the end of the tunnel. 

Most people my age still talk to their high school friends, have connections to the world- I know I’m young, but I feel so old. I’ve wasted my whole life so far and have no idea how to pick up the pieces and move forward when I’m so painfully ill equipped and behind compared to my peers. The last time I was sober this long I was a child. I have no idea how to mourn the loss of an adolescence I barely remember and accept that I’m an adult I don’t even recognize with apparently no capacity for joy. Everyday I feel lost and confused, I don’t feel real. I’ve spent so long closing my eyes and standing still that I have no idea how to move forward or live my life, and any time I do make a change I can recognize, it’s terrifying and I want to run back to the safety of stagnancy. 

The only thing that gets me through the day is living in fantasies of the past that can never happen. I don’t want to be so old at 24 and so young somehow, too. The grief of who I was and could have been, and the friends I’ve lost to overdose, or to my own poor choices, the things I saw and experienced so young, it’s unbearable and I have the emotional regulation skills of a 14 year old. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m in therapy, I’m on medication, I go to meetings, I’m even trying to exercise and take supplements. I hate taking care of myself, I want to be better but I hate everything that gets me there. I don’t want to white knuckle my way through life. I’m tired of being alone with all my nothing. How can I dig myself out of this?? Or at least get out of my own way??",45

To every addict and recovering addict out there—especially those battling opiates—this message is for YOU.

No two paths to recovery look the same. Some of us fall a hundred times before we ever get back up. Some lose everything before they find their reason to fight. But no matter how deep the hole you're in, recovery is possible.

You don’t have to do it perfectly. You don’t have to have all the answers. You just have to take the next step… and then the one after that.

You are NOT too far gone.
You are NOT hopeless.
You are NOT broken beyond repair.

You are stronger than you know, more worthy than you believe, and capable of change beyond your imagination.

I’ve been through the fire. I know what it's like to feel like you’ll never make it out. But I’m almost 5 years clean now...

When you’re ready—truly ready—to stop using, your healing will begin. And with every day clean, you’ll remember what it feels like to be alive again.

Keep going. You’re not alone. And you’re not weak for struggling—you’re powerful for continuing to try.

✊ You’re worthy of recovery.
❤️ You’re worthy of love.
🌟 And your life is not over—it’s just beginning.

I guess I’ve been lucky because my old doctor was so kind and understanding- I really felt heard when I spoke and truly felt like he cared about my well being. This QuickMD doctor didn’t even treat me like I was a human- first off only part of her face was even in the frame which I thought was odd, she was immediately rude to me for no reason, had no interest in what I had to say when trying to explain what has been going on and what meds have helped me in the past.

77,1je6nnc,A junkie's creed,[deleted],34,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1je6nnc/a_junkies_creed/,"I've spent probably 14 years of my life off and on opiates and I'm on a low dose maintaience now. I'll never forget being almost a year clean when i read a post, I think on reddit from someone who was years clean, almost a decade.

 It started like a speech from a speaker in NA. Very anti-addiction, hopeful, and grateful, then slowly crept into territory of realism, and finally collapsed into a full blown love letter to Heroin, like an ex-lover from your 20 somethings you thought would be the one, and you've since ""moved on"". Have a wife and kids, or vice-versa, yet that memory still lingers and the slow crawl and simple pleasures of life don't seem to scratch that same itch. This person literally went from saying they were so glad to be clean, and ended the post by saying they might go cop literally at that moment. 

It was pretty heartbreaking to read because it really made me wonder, if this person is still feeling this way after almost a decade clean, will I ever not at least, kinda miss opiates? That was when I was about 22-23 and I'm 33 now. What the fuck man, lol. 

I say all this to say that I think the hardest part of giving up opiates is the realism that as far as knew. When I was maintaining, not obliterated, and not sick, just a happy medium between, and usually when I first relapse, people gravitate toward me, and the opiates make it very easy for all the awkwardness of social interactions to fade and transform into opportunities for friendship and even romance. Of course, to keep up with this long term becomes even more difficult though. 

It makes me feel like it's a double edged sword because opiates aren't like alcohol where people can clearly see you're under the influence and so they disregard the vibe your putting out. Opiates hijack the endorphin system and work behind the scenes to manufactor what appears to everyone else like genuine love, happiness, and desire. So long as you don't take it too far and look like an actual junkie or the people interacting with you don't know the telltale signs, but even then they'll tend to want to believe in that portrayal. 

The hardest part of being a junkie wasn't/isn't the maintaience of it. It's being comfortable and instantly in control of how you feel or need to feel, in any given situation, while watching the rest of the world chase the thing you have complete control over. It's like that monolouge in Trainspotting when he lists off all the things ""normal"" people chase. And in the end we're all chasing the same feeling, junkies just found a shortcut to that feeling. 

I'm not saying it's smart or right, we risk death, isolation, and suffering worse than death. No matter how on top of it we'd like to think we are and i realize that after 14 years with each year getting more out of control quality, price, and potency wise. 

Who knows maybe it's a different life for a junkie in somewhere where you can literally just buy pure, pharmacy grade opiates legally. I'd imagine so, but maybe that access would just make it worse since we all crave the control, and limitless control would probably not end too well, but i guess who knows. 

I'm kind of just rambling around the point though..

The point of this is, i got to a point in the past 3 years where I just felt like. Well..maybe this is my purpose in life..to be an example and a voice of reason, even if I can't help myself, maybe i can help people around me, and reason with them. After all I'm living proof, if you can't listen to me, then who tf are you gonna listen to? You're not gonna listen to people in sobriety, and you're not gonna hear out the people who've never lived it. I was content with that for a while, but in the winter it would get pretty lonely. And finally the few people in my family that still cared smacked me with reality and no amount of dope would block the pain of that dissapointment. 

It makes me look back at everything I just wrote and think.. Who tf do I think I am? Jesus or something? Lol. I probably felt like a god on opiates but in all reality was I ever really perceived like I felt I was? Was it even the opiates to begin with, or was it just my excuse to be comfortable with who I really am to begin with? Do I have am endorphin deficiency naturally? Wtf even is normal? Do normal people feel like how I did on opiates or am I just not content with feeling how normal people feel? So many questions dude...lol. 

BTW, I'm on 4mgs of methadone daily now, so idk I guess I'm just trying to confront myself and my addiction and really get to the root of everything. Trying to find a way to reclaim the life I built on opiates..without opiates. But every junkies just addicted to themselves technically and metaphorically. We're not addicted to ""opiates"" we're addicted to endorphins. We're addicted to love, happiness. Isn't everyone? Or...are they not?

78,1ien71u,Feeling sorry for yourself.,Rurfy_The_Riftdog,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1ien71u/feeling_sorry_for_yourself/,"Try not to get so paralyzingly hung up on wasted time, missed opportunities, regrets and the like.

If you are an addict, it is almost certain that you have essentially thrown away some significant portion or aspect of your life. Wasted something that you will never get back. I also wouldn't be surprised if that thing you wasted ended up being something incredibly precious to you, and the thought of that loss is soul crushingly difficult to cope with psychologically. It sucks.

Don't get me wrong. Regret is important. It serves a logical evolutionary purpose. It is a powerful indicator that is easily remembered. A quick reference alarm for you to use in the future to avoid the regretful mistake a second time. But we're addicts. I don't think it's a stretch to say we tend to take things to extremes. To excess. 

Regret is worthless to you if you wallow in it. Just like with our addictions, too much of something is almost always horrible. Every day you spend feeling sorry for yourself is another wasted day. Another day to Regret later. 

Do you want to come to the end of your life regretting the fact that you spent your entire life regretting all the things you fucked up? I certainly don't. I'll keep my Regret, but I'm going to use it to my advantage, not my detriment. I hope you do too.

82,1l0ksr4,Can anyone relate to the sense of bliss? That I experience during acute withdrawals?,prince_kittenzzz,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1l0ksr4/can_anyone_relate_to_the_sense_of_bliss_that_i/,"Obviously we all know withdrawals suck hard. But the last few times I kicked, I noticed that at some point (or several points) during the process, I’m overcome with a sense of hopefulness/contentment/appreciation of the most minuscule beauties of life. I can only think to compare it to a profound realization that comes over you during an influential psychedelic experience. Sure my stomach’s in knots, I have a full body sweat/shiver going, but ya know… I think everything is gonna work out just fine. I know this feeling won’t last forever (or could it?). But it’s oddly cathartic and I never notice anyone else mentioning this. 

My best theory is that it’s simply because my emotions are finally being let free after being dulled for so long. Music hits so much different. Just appreciation for life in general. another chance to become a better version of myself grateful for this life and despite the hell addiction has put me and so many others thru, i genuinely believe i needed to experience it in order to truly appreciate what i do have, including the power to become any version of myself that i choose, provided i put in the required work. 

Anyways sorry for rambling. I’m about two days into my detox from heroin, using 7oh and alprazolam sparingly to make it possible to make it thru the last two days of work. I know it’s going to get worse before it gets better but I wish everyone the best in their journey of life, and hope you realize how much potential you truly have at any given moment. Much love!",29

The clock strikes three, the world's asleep,
Yet here I lie, the cravings creep.
A whisper calls, a ghostly pull,
That old dark hunger, never full.

Four long years, I've walked this line,
No pill, no high, just heart and mind.
I fight the urge, I stand up tall,
I won’t go back—I’ve seen it all.

For me, I stay, I choose the light,
Through every storm, through every fight.
But there’s a fire that burns so bright—
Her name is River, my guiding light.

Her laughter lifts me when I fall,
Her tiny voice, my wake-up call.
With little hands, she holds my heart,
Reminding me I’ve come too far.

And then there’s you, my love long gone,
Crystal, lost but never gone.
I swore I’d rise, I'd break the chain,
To honor you, to bear the pain.

Some nights are good, some nights are war,
But I won’t knock on death’s old door.
NA gave me tools to fight,
I use them all, I hold on tight.

I walk with God, He leads my way,
Without His love, I'd fade away.
Now passion fuels the steps I take,
To help the lost, to heal, to break—

The chains of others, just like me,
To show them there’s a way to be.
So when the cravings start to bite,
I pray, I stand—I win the night.

84,1j3s6g2,almost slipped up. needed to tell someone,RavioliMeThtFormuoli,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1j3s6g2/almost_slipped_up_needed_to_tell_someone/,"idk what's been going on with my head lately. been clean from crack and dope for 2 years. this last month i have not been able to stop thinking about crack..i use kratom to stay off dope which works for me. idk why i crave crack so badly. i hated every second of it after the rush wore off. made me paranoid borderline schizophrenic and i would pick my face till it bled. i'm a normal looking guy with a nice car and nice job, you wouldn't assume by looking at me that i smoked and used for 8 years. the last few days i kept dreaming about crack smh lmao. then i found out i'm off work tomorrow...and my mind went into autopilot...

normally i would call my guy, but i moved and changed numbers when i got clean, so there is no guy for me to call (which is for the best). however, i live 15 mins from one of the largest open air markets on the east coast / mid atlantic. i hopped in my car and drove to the city. the whole drive there i felt guilty and gross. but i ignored those feeling and pushed forward. i drove down the main stretch and turned down the side streets however no one was posted, cops were out in full force (an officer was murdered a week ago).


with no luck finding anyone and the guilt getting stronger, i decided to turn around and head home.  i couldn't stop thinking about getting jammed up by the cops, how bad i used to look from picking my face tweaked out on rock...how paranoid and schizophrenic it made me feel...before hoping on the highway i stopped at a corner store and parked up with no plan in mind. 

this ""down on his luck"" looking dude walked up to my window and asked me if i could buy him a soda and some blunt wraps. so i did, i don't mind helping someone out. when he came out i asked him if he knew where i could score a 20 of rock. he knew a spot..he told me he was gonna run to the house across the street and grab it, and he would be right back. he didn't ask for my money, he just told me to wait. after he walked away a cop pulled in and parked next to me, cop ignored me and ran into the store. 

i left immediately and drove home. i took the cop arriving as a sign to not go thru with the deal. by that point the guilt and self hatred had filled my body.

i'm currently sitting in a wawa parking lot typing this before i spend that $20 on dinner. 

idk who is going to read this but thank you for letting me vent to you. i don't have anybody in my personal life who i can tell this to and keeping it inside makes me feel worse. i live alone with my dog and have virtually 0 friends, and currently can't afford therapy yet. typing this out makes me feel a little better. love you all thank you for reading my message as i try to work thru these feelings",31

I won't say this is a success story because it's ongoing and mainly I don't want to get too cocky, but we should celebrate every minute we're clean. I have actual hope for my life which really trips me out. I can't remember how long it's been since I've felt that. I'm not buried by my shame and guilt. My focus isn't in my past only paying attention to what's behind me. Those chains aren't holding me back anymore. For the first time in my life I have found real acceptance for myself. I can unapologetically be me. 

Recovery actually seems possible to attain. One day at a time. One hour at a time. One minute at a time. I've found NA to be a lifesaver for me but I don't want to preach. I just want to say it's possible. We owe it to ourselves to scrape, claw, and fight for our freedom. We owe it to ourselves to exhaust every option to arrest our disease. We deserve to live life clean. We are all worth it. As hard as it to believe that sometimes, we are all worth it. 

Remember that you are not alone. Give yourself some grace. Give yourself a hug. Love and accept yourself. You are worth it and deserve it",21

It wasn't by choice, and I'm in pain, extremely exhausted, and depressed. But I feel more clear? I feel like I just got sucked out of my head back into the real world. I'm no longer in a state of constant dissociation, but I kind of preferred that after a while. Feeling real again is a rollercoaster, but I also feel like this is the beginning of having a normal, fulfilling life. I have such mixed feelings about this. I want my brain to be like everyone else's. That's all I want. I want to be happy and energized. I don't know why I can't feel normal by myself. 

The opiates somehow kept me awake, focused, and productive? Downers have worked better than any prescription stimulant I've had, honestly. Wtf. I'm just grieving my productivity and energy, I guess. I think I'm grieving everything I've ever felt in my brain that made me content. I don't even know what I'm trying to say anymore. I just want to be happy, and I want to feel like myself. Everyone is so happy for me for finally breaking my addiction and so happy that I am no longer in withdrawal. I feel empty though, like I don't have the ability to be happy. Did I ever really feel whole though? I don't know.

91,1iw5bsa,Running out of pills - was going to buy more but just stumbled into this sub and decided that I’m going to quit instead,RainbowBlak,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1iw5bsa/running_out_of_pills_was_going_to_buy_more_but/,"10 years ago, I (f, at the time 23) was prescribed a repeat script for codeine due to back pain. This marked the start of a decade long battle with opioid addiction. The script was stopped cold turkey about 18 months later but by that time I was already deep into addiction territory. I have stopped/started over the years but never really had any inclination to fully quit. About a year ago, I moved onto dihydrocodeine, which I buy from an online pharmacy. I go through withdrawal hell every single month due to the restrictions they place on ordering, and I hate it. I receive a monthly prescription of Gabapentin for genuine nerve damage and I always take them too fast in order to enhance the high from the pills, then I leave myself to suffer the nerve pain for the rest of the month, which also sucks. 

I am down to my last few dihydrocodeine pills and my plan was as follows - 2 this morning, 2 this evening, then 3 tomorrow morning as a “treat” because tomorrow is my birthday, then I’m out until I can re-order. I’m already experiencing some withdrawals due to the dosage decrease but I know they will hit full force once I fully run out. After I post this, I’m going to email the online pharmacy I purchase them from and ask them to disable my account. 

About an hour ago I found this sub and out of curiosity read a couple of posts. A couple turned into a few more, then a few more and now I’m sat here re-evaluating my whole life. Reading the heart-warming, inspiring journeys from those of you who have quit (and those of you who are in the process of doing so) has been nothing short of an epiphany for me. I’ve realised that I don’t want to spend my life in a cycle of opiate abuse and withdrawal. I don’t want to feel like the only way I can feel happy and experience joy is by chemically altering my brain. I don’t want to find out that a friend has recently been prescribed some opiates for a genuine medical reason, then spend the rest of my day subtly mentioning this “pain” I’ve been having in a way to build up to asking for some 😭 

I have a little girl who deserves a mum that doesn’t cycle through phases of being energetic/happy/full of life to fatigued/irritible/feeling ill each month. 

I will have to do this on my own as my husband and family have no idea about my addiction. I have been hiding this for 10 years, which has been stressful in itself, and also something that my husband does not deserve. 

I know that there will be 1000’s of tips if I search this sub, but if anyone wants to drop them here too I would be grateful. Saying that - one of the most irritating (but not worst) withdrawal symptoms I always face is a runny nose. Is there anything that helps with this? 

Anyway, I know that in terms of addictions, mine is on the milder end of the opiate spectrum, but it has been hell for me nonetheless. So, from the bottom of my heart I want to say thank you to each and every one of you. You are all inspirational and without this sub I’m not sure I would have ever reached this decision. I’ve honestly never felt determination like it. I know it won’t be easy, and there will probably be setbacks and road bumps along the way, but I really don’t want to live like this anymore. 

Good luck to those of you on your own journeys to sobriety and a huge well done to those of you who have already reached it. Love to you all 🩷

92,1iq46sw,I can’t cope being sober,Soft_Operation3953,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1iq46sw/i_cant_cope_being_sober/,"I’m 21m, I got out of rehab 2 months ago for a 2 year oxy, benzo and tramadol habit, that was on  and off but kept getting progressively worse up to about 70mg oxy a day and various benzos. I came out of rehab with the mindset that I want to to give sobriety a go and obtain full abstinence from all mind/mood altering substances. Not even 2 weeks out I picked up Kratom. Then found some sleeping pills, started taking those, then started having the odd drink out. All while living with my parents telling them I’m sober. Then I picked up pregablin and got caught the next day. Now it’s been a month since then and my life is coming together, I’m back in the gym, running, got a job, starting my last year of varsity. But my emotional regulation is fucked, and I’m still using sleeping pills, Ritalin and had 1 relapse on oxy. 

There are days like today where I feel immense sadness, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, and all I want to do is use oxy. I think the only thing that’s stopping me, is the fact that I live with my parents. I know that if I was left to my own devices, I would have picked up ages ago. I dont want to be feel this way, I don’t want to use oxy and fuck my life up more. But I feel so overwhelmed by everything and just want it all to go away, and feel safe. Don’t get me wrong there are good days sober, but the bad, are really bad. And I see no way or point to carry on with life without using. I feel lonely, my confidence is shattered, I don’t have many friends that I can see, my gf broke up with me whilst I was in rehab, I’m yearning for connection. 

I don’t know how to navigate this, I know intellectually getting sober is the right thing to do, and I want to. But emotionally I cant win. Life feels too hard sober, and I ask myself, what’s the point. 

Anyways there my vent, hope you can relate Please please please, don’t use opiates if you haven’t already, they will flip your life upside down forever, within the blink of an eye. ",49

94,1hdckjd,"If drugs are the solution, then what is the problem?",LonnieJay1,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1hdckjd/if_drugs_are_the_solution_then_what_is_the_problem/,"A common saying in the recovery community is something to the effect of ""drugs weren't my problem, they were my solution.""

I feel that this was true for me. In fact, I made a list of the problems I had, in the general order in which they came up, and for which drugs were my solution - even if this ""solution"" inevitably created more problems. 

My problems came in three stages: early, middle, and end-stage addiction. I found this to be a useful exercise for reflection and recommend you try it. Feel free to add your thoughts to the comments if nowhere else👇 

EARLY ADDICTION: EXPERIMENTATION AND SNIFFING OXY

ANXIETY: being struck with sudden and overwhelming self-awareness at 14 led to a strong sense of anxiety. Self-medicating with opioids made this discomfort fade away. After sniffing some oxy, I could crack jokes with zero inhibition, and not a care in the world what you thought about me either way. Anxiety was my initial problem, and opioids were a bonafide solution.

LOW SELF-ESTEEM: I was a people pleaser from the rip; this was my second big problem. I always loved making people laugh and impressing people when I was younger. I worried about what other people thought about me and didn't ever think about what I thought about myself. 

Low self-esteem was fertile ground for the roots of addiction and opioids were an ultra-potent fertilizer, since they gave me a positive feeling about myself that I wasn't achieving elsewhere. They made me feel powerful. This quickly led to another problem: my self-esteem would slip away when I wasn't high. The vicious cycle begins.

WOMEN: This must be mentioned early on in this list. One of my favorite things about opioids initially was the feeling that they gave me around women. Ultra-confident, silver-tongued, carefree, and with the ability to please her for longer than two minutes (lol). Opioids gave me a feeling of emotional invincibility. They quickly became a necessity for any social event with women present, and absolutely mandatory for any date type situation.

LACK OF IDENTITY: adolescence is a crucial time in which humans naturally specialize into a field, historically speaking. Gone are the days of the adolescent son rubbing shoulders with his master blacksmith father and learning what it means to be a blacksmith. I had no mentorship or apprenticeship experience of any sort - I doubt many teenagers do these days, especially those that wind up addicted.

My lack of an intrinsic sense of identity and external specialization led me to quickly adopt the identity of psychonaut and drug user, which eventually led to the identites of drug dealer, drug educator, street pharmacist, and eventually ""addict"" (a label i no longer identify with)

IDLE TIME: I played sports when I was younger and was athletic but quit several sports and didn't push myself hard. My parents let me quit and didn't push me either. I'm not blaming them, just mentioning it as I believe this ""idle time"" was indeed the devil's workshop for me. 

I see kids these days involved in extracurriculars and can't help but wonder what my life could've been like if I had more structure and accountability. Instead of going to practice after school, I would get high with my buddies once high school ended and immediately become ultra-focused on the hustle and bustle of the drug game.

IMPAIRED SALIENCE BASED ATTENTION SYSTEM AKA ADHD: High school did not hold my attention. The idea of going to college and earning a degree wasn't salient / attention-grabbing to me. I wanted a lot of money and power, fast, and the drug game offered the risks and excitement regular life couldn't hold a candle to. 

I was prescribed adderall for ADHD when I was younger but didn't like that it actually caused me to sit still and pay attention. Other kids would literally ask me what was wrong with me when I took it, so I stopped. My life would likely look very different had I just stayed on it and allowed myself to become a cog in the educational machine.

GREED: Greed is defined as ""having or showing an intense and selfish desire for something, especially wealth or power."" This describes exactly how i felt when i was younger, and it was obviously a huge problem. The strange combination of greed and low self-esteem can be a real killer. My value of self was determined by my ability to attain things, and on top of that, I truly and deeply desired wealth and power.

SELFISHNESS: There is certainly such a thing as healthy selfishness, and unhealthy selflessness, but when I was in early addiction I was selfish to a fault. I felt that I was entitled to pleasure, status, and wealth. Thinking about it now makes me cringe.

MIDDLE PHASE OF ADDICTION: ENTER HEROIN

There were problems I had before I picked up that led to me becoming an ""addict"". Being an ""addict"", however, also created a whole host of other problems - ironically and terribly, drugs were the solution for many of these problems as well.

CHRONIC STRESS: using and selling drugs was incredibly stressful for me. There was the stress of the drug game - people trying to rob me, running around doing illegal shit, trying to avoid getting caught using by my family - and the incredible stress of the criminal justice system, in my case. 

I was arrested 4 times between the ages of 14 and 18, and had a 3 year suspended prison sentence hanging over my head while doing intensive outpatient and pissing multiple times a week for probation entering my adulthood. The stress was incredible. I could barely sleep. I had recurring dreams of having to fight in prison. Oxy - and then dope - helped it all fade away, if only for a blink and a nod.

This chronic stress might look totally different for someone else. Physical pain can be a big chronic stressor. Accumulated debts are another. Work and familial responsibilities have the potential to be unbelievably stress-inducing. A very common comorbidity with addictive disorders is PTSD. The trauma response results in elevated stress hormones aka chronic stress.

DEPRESSION: Chronic stress directly causes depression; the medical literature is clear about that. When I was addicted and trying to quit, the depression was incredible. 

Why get out of bed? What do I have to look forward to? Why fight? The lack of energy was palpable. I could barely will myself to breathe sober breaths. Simply smiling was a momentous task.

NEGATIVE SELF-IMAGE: In the middle stage of addiction, I started to make some attempts to stop doing drugs. I couldn't. I felt like a fucking loser. I was a piece of shit. People told me I would be an ""addict"" for the rest of my life. People were watching me constantly, waiting for me to fuck up again, and I hated it all.

At a certain point, i felt like i might as well act like who i felt I was, and behave in accordance with what people were telling me that I was. One of the reasons I continued to use drugs was because I - and everyone around me - held the image of me as a person who uses drugs. I was going to be an ""addict"" forever, so why try to be anything else? This is a subtle, almost subconscious mental process that led me to unbelievable suffering and continuous relapse.

COMPULSIVENESS: I was likely predisposed to compulsiveness before I started getting high, but drugs made me unbelievably compulsive. I would smoke weed automatically if it were around me, even knowing that I didn't really like it or that it was going to make me anxious or that I could go to prison if i were caught. Opioids gave me a feeling of freedom from the compulsiveness, even if my behavior didn't change. I just felt like things were a little slower and that I was more in control, I suppose.

OBSESSIVENESS: My thoughts became obsessive, to the point that I felt like I was going crazy. I would obsess over not doing drugs and then obsess over doing drugs in the very next moment. I felt no freedom of thought, my thoughts were automatic and cyclical in a way that would make me want to scream. Of course, the dope would quiet my mind - until it didn't (see end-stage addiction)

BOREDOM: On days that i conquered the stress, depression, negative feelings of self, and drug-induced OCD, I would be confronted with an incredible boredom. Even smoking weed, eating chocolate cake, and playing halo 3 - which would have been heaven to me just a few years earlier - wouldn't satisfy me; and it would often just leave me burnt out and tired and feeling like even more of a loser. Boredom was one of a cluster of related problems, and they shared the same inevitable, predictable, sole solution: dope.

LONELINESS: Boredom would be compounded by loneliness, and I knew that one of my homies was only a phone call away. I could call him, go pick him up, and then go get any number of substances, and ride around selling them and getting high and meeting all kinds of different people. To go from the loneliness and boredom to that social chaos on top of the high was nearly irresistable to me, especially as a person that had ADHD and drug-induced OCD.

SENSATION SEEKING: this deserves to be on here because it is a real problem for many people trying to develop out of an addiction. I had to be able to accurately frame the ""chaos"" and ""fun"" of the drug game and see it for what it really is: an illusion. In reality, drug use is a monotonous treadmill of pain, loss, and perpetual dissatisfaction that exists on the edge of an eroding cliff.

END-STAGE ADDICTION: IV SPEEDBALLS AND XANAX

LIFE: By the time I reached 12 years of addiction at age 26, I was just done with life. Being alive and conscious was the problem. My addiction crystallized and became all of me. 

Lack of identity in the early stage had become a permanent and all-consuming Identity: I was nothing but a no-good addict, who was capable only of getting everyone's hopes up through stints of recovery, only to wind up worse than ever.

My low self esteem (stage 1), which had evolved into negative self-image (stage 2) had become an incredible and aggressive self-loathing. Quieting the mind with drugs was completely impossible. I started to feel genuine rage: towards God, myself, and everyone around me. I started to understand the darkest elements of human nature.

Loneliness, sensation seeking, boredom, - none of these problems could even be conceived as separate any longer. My problem was that I was alive, and had to continue to experience the hell of end-stage hardcore drug addiction, which had become my only reality. Hope had become the illusion; sobriety could never be achieved. I started to doubt that even death could save me; I would go from one hell to another.

The only thing that kept me alive at the end was the knowledge that if I killed myself with this injection, then I wouldn't be able to get that infamous ""one more"", no matter how unsatisfying it always was. My last two weeks of hardcore addiction consisted of using solely to obliterate consciousness. I could not stand to be awake.

End stage addiction was like being ensnared in a vast and intricate spider web of problems. Everywhere I turned I saw problems that were linked in a million unsolvable ways.

The solutions that were immediately apparent were to numb myself to the web of problems with the most potent drugs known to man, which doesn't even work at the end stage anyway, or obliterate myself and the web, which I was very close to doing.

Luckily, my family came to help me one last time. Apparently I reached out to them during a blackout. I could not have escaped the web by myself.

All of life had become one problem, which meant there was only one solution: transformation. I think this is why spirituality is the most successful treatment for addiction. It leads to transformation. 

Transformation is akin to a process of controlled and subtle self-immolation that extends outward into the web of problems that surrounds me. The web becomes weaker; I am able to navigate it with more control.

That was my experience, anyway, and transformation is a topic that deserves its' own post.

Like 12 hours after a shower I’m typically peachy clean still…. During this withdrawal process I just.. don’t understand where this odor is coming from. It gotta be related no?

I’m not asking for medical advice, I know it’s mostly from sweating and not showering as often as normal but it still seems outrageous compared to other times in my life when I skipped showers and stuff.",47

I’m 20 years old and currently 8 days clean from opiates. I’ve been in a clinic and I’m doing my best to rebuild my life and get through this.

I wanted to ask: when do the withdrawal symptoms and mental pain start to ease up? I’ve read a lot of posts saying things get better after about two weeks is that really the case?

Right now I’m on pregabalin, and while I was in the clinic they also gave me Valium to help with sleep, since I’ve had severe sleep problems ever since I was a kid. Sleep is still rough, but maybe slightly better than it was.

Yesterday I forced myself to go outside, get some sunlight and move a bit. It wasn’t easy, but I think it helped. Should I be pushing myself to do that more often, even when everything in me wants to stay inside?

I’d really appreciate any advice or hearing how things went for others around this point in recovery. Thanks for reading.",65

It was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done both physically and mentally. For a while, I actually felt free. I was clean. I thought I was finally done with this cycle.
But about three weeks ago, I slipped. I fell back into daily heroin use. At the same time, I started a new job, trying to hold things together on the outside while everything inside me started to fall apart again.

Now I feel stuck. I don’t want to go back on methadone it messed me up physically, and I promised myself I wouldn’t return to it. But I also can’t keep doing this. I’m tired. I’m scared of spiraling deeper, and I’m not sure how to break this pattern again

I’m sharing this not for sympathy, but because hiding it only feeds the shame. If you’ve been here too if you’ve relapsed, if you’ve felt hopeless, if you’ve gotten clean and then lost your grip I want you to know you’re not alone. I’m still trying. I’m not giving up. I just don’t know what the next step is right now.

My son, who is 28 now, was addicted to oxycodone, meth, and heroin at the age of 16. I didn't have a clue until he was 19 when he came to me and said he wanted to go to rehab. He went for 30 days, and the night he got home, he used. He continued using, and at the age of 24, he started using fentanyl. He didn't work, turned into a thief, was homeless, and didn't care about anything but getting high. Every time my son was around me and high, I'd constantly look at his chest to make sure he was breathing. He's overdosed More times than I want to even think about. I stopped waiting for him to get clean and started waiting for him to die. At the age of 27, he decided he was tired of living the kind of life he was living. He called his cousin, she picked him up and that day he moved 3 hours south of the people, the places and the things. He's been clean for almost 18 months, has a really good job, and is living on his own for the first time. I'm so proud of him.

I'm so proud of myself for getting on MAT and getting my life back together.

  
Last year, my account would have shown around -$800. Yes, negative. Since I get weekly direct deposits, my bank would allow me to overdraft up to $800 on my account. As I'm sure you can guess, this was awful and left me in and endless cycle of overdraft fees and debt. I would get my weekly pay (roughly 1k USD) and since I was so in the red, I'd end up with about $150 - which would right away go to my dealer. Then I'd spend the rest of the week trying to scheme some money until payday. I make $77k a year but was always broke and scrounging around my car for change to put some gas in.

  
My bank also has an get your pay early feature. Only issue is, it wouldn't always be early. Sometimes I'd get paid Wednesday, sometimes Friday. So you can imagine how it felt when it wouldn't come Wednesday.

  
I've been on MAT since December of 2024 and I can honestly say it changed my life. There was always a stigma when I'd ask about MAT, usually something along the lines of 'you're just getting addicted to something else!'. However, if you're already addicted to fent/blues, what's it matter? At least this way you're not waiting 45 minutes in a sketchy neighborhood getting 'im around the corner' texts. You're not worried about where you'll get your next high. You're not worried about getting some bunk shit, spending all your money, and still being sick. In my experience, I haven't had a single negative effect from the Methadone!

  
I went from spending up to $300 a day on blues to now getting bi-weekly takehomes and only paying $55 a week. It's truly changed me as a person and helped me develop better habits. Getting high or getting sick is no longer on my mind. 

I'm able to be present for my beautiful girlfriend and my awesome dog. I'm able to give them anything they want, whenever they want! I'm able to setup all my bills on auto-pay! I'm able to save money! I'm able to get anything I want!

107,1j8lk4n,12 Years of Heroin Addiction: My Journey to Recovery and a New Life,[deleted],31,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1j8lk4n/12_years_of_heroin_addiction_my_journey_to/,"Hello everyone. I’ve been on this sub for a month, and I’ve read some stories that have really touched me. Every time I read your stories, I see myself reflected in them in some way. Deep down, I believe that we, the addicts of the world, form a kind of brotherhood

Today, I want to share my story. I hope that someone can relate to it or that it helps someone make the decision to quit drugs. If it helps even one person, that will be enough for me.

The first time I smoked heroin was one night in early summer 2008. I was struggling with depression, tired of not having any excitement in life. It was a conscious decision. I was 22 years old, freshly graduated from university, and I didn’t know what to do with my life. My friends were starting to build something meaningful with their lives and were drifting away from me. And on top of that, my girlfriend had left me for another guy (I don’t blame her—the other guy was simply better than me, and she was very considerate, trying to make sure the breakup didn’t affect me psychologically). I felt very lonely and miserable. I had tried other drugs before—mainly cocaine and speed—but I hadn’t gotten hooked on any of them. However, I knew heroin was different. I knew it even before I started using it.

It was easy to get started. I just went to the neighborhood in my city where I knew drugs were sold, bought some, and used it right there in the same house. A girl who was using there guided me through the process of preparing the drug. Later, we became friends. I liked the feeling I got from heroin (I’m not going to go into more detail here). The next day, I woke up at noon, and the first thing I thought about was going to buy more. I remember being fully aware that if I gave in, I would fall into a deep, dark pit with no easy way out. I held out until 3 in the afternoon, and at that hour—during the hottest part of the day, in the hottest summer on record in my area at the time—with my body and mind sluggish from the sun and the scorching air, I thought, ‘Screw it,’ and got dressed to go buy more.

What followed, for twelve incredibly long years, was exactly what I expected—the full package. A series of highs, withdrawals, escapes, struggles, misery, happiness, sadness, absolute depression… A total chaos of emotions and experiences: car accidents, hospital admissions, family gatherings ending in tears, stealing from my parents, getting fired from one job after another… Summarizing those 12 years in a single paragraph feels so surreal. Every day without drugs was like an entire lifetime—it was as if my life was on pause and wouldn’t resume until I got my dose. Everything revolved around heroin. I would sit down to watch a TV show, and my mind would be focused on getting drugs. I’d go to work and only think about finishing my shift so I could go buy some (some days, I even smoked at work). Then, when I used, I felt completely guilty and miserable. Many times, I didn’t even get high—I just did it to feel physically okay.

Luckily, I managed to hold up physically. I put my body through infinite stress from cycles of use and withdrawal, from which I’ve fortunately come out relatively intact. But psychologically, I ended up devastated. It wasn’t until 2020 that I finally managed to detox completely.

I have to say that at no point during those 12 years did I feel like a victim. I suffered a lot, I regretted starting, of course—I cried rivers of tears—but I knew that I and only I had chosen that path. And I had done it with full knowledge of my actions.

Today, I’ve rebuilt my life. I’m far away from drugs (my only current vice is vaping, and I’ve also quit drinking alcohol). I live alone with my cat, and I have a good job. What I went through during all those years now feels very distant, yet at the same time, it’s as if it all happened just yesterday. I don’t let my guard down—I’m still very afraid of relapsing, but for now, I don’t think that will happen, even though I still have bad days. I feel like I’ve lost 12 years of my life, my entire youth, and that I’ve become a more cynical and less joyful person. I’ll probably never get those years back, but I’m okay with that. Thanks to my psychologist, I’ve managed to make peace with myself, and my parents have forgiven me for everything I did, but I’m still very hard on myself for some of the things I did. I still have work to do moving forward. But that’s okay—I have the strength to do it.

If you have read this far, thanks!. I don’t care where you’re from—whether it’s the USA, Europe, Australia, Pakistan, or anywhere else—you're important to me. I apologize if I’ve made any grammatical mistakes—English is not my native language (I’m from Spain), and although I speak some English, given how long this text is, I translated it using AI.

Lastly, I hope all of you manage to break free from drugs. Living without them is worth it, even though the fight is so hard.

Greetings to you all.",11

He doesn’t speak to me and truly doesn’t care that I got better. I literally disappeared from his life one morning in pitiful shape and he was just happy that I was gone. 

I keep wondering what was so wrong with me that I didn’t have what many other addicts have. I had no one cheering for me on the sidelines. I keep seeing stories of grieving spouses who lost their husbands/wives/partners to addiction and I wonder why they were lovable but I wasn’t. Almost all of us are hard to deal with in addiction to some degree or another but I feel like most people are given grace knowing that the person is separate from the addiction. I just keep feeling so unlovable and like something is really wrong with me.

114,1i0nzhv,One week sober ,[deleted],30,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1i0nzhv/one_week_sober/,"For the first time in three years of taking opiates daily, I’ve made it through an entire week sober. It’s a milestone I never thought I’d hit, and I’ve been reading so many stories on this sub, both inspiring and heartbreaking but that has been a huge source of motivation for me.

I know my story isn’t unique. I’m in the same position as millions of others, I have a good life. No one knows about my addiction, but it’s been quietly tearing my life apart. Over the years, I’ve withdrawn from friends and family, stopped going out, and became a shell of myself. The changes were gradual, so subtle that people around me didn’t notice.

Last year was the worst for me. I isolated myself almost completely. Even when I did see people, I couldn’t wait to get back home. My entire life revolved around finding, stocking, and planning for these pills. I didn’t see myself as an addict but just as someone who needed them, like anti depressants. I didn’t want to post here until I had something to show for it or until I could say I’d made real progress.

Now, after just one week sober, I’m starting to feel like myself again. I know it’s still very early, but I’m feeling back to myself. 

I know this isn’t the kind of post that’s interesting—no robberies, no dramatic rock bottom. But I think that’s the point. Most addicts aren’t the stereotype we think of. Many of us live in nice homes, hold good jobs, and keep up appearances. We don’t talk about it because of the embarrassment,  (that’s why I’m here and not telling my family) and because we don’t see ourselves in the public perception of what “an addict” looks like. 

Right now my life is saveable but if I lost my job and family, there’ll be no reason for me to get sober. So I hope someone who’s going down a same path makes the decision now before it gets worse.

We’re missing the bridge to treatment, and it’s costing lives",HexMarine,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1ox197c/narcan_saves_people_but_fentanyl_kills_them_again/,"Narcan saves lives, but fentanyl is killing people again in the hours and days after they’re revived. That “post-overdose window” is the most dangerous part of the entire crisis, and right now there is zero medical tool designed for it.

Clinics can start someone on Suboxone, but only after withdrawal begins. With fentanyl, that can take 24–72 hours. If you start too soon, you trigger violent precipitated withdrawal. It’s not a failure of Suboxone — it’s a timing problem the system has never solved.

And this is where people die. They walk out of the ER or away from EMS, use again to feel normal, and overdose a second time. It’s the deadliest 48-hour period in modern public health.

What’s missing is a bridge between Narcan and treatment.

We need a field-ready, fentanyl-safe buprenorphine induction device that lets EMS, clinics, or outreach teams slowly microdose buprenorphine in a way that doesn’t trigger precipitated withdrawal. The science already exists. The delivery technology already exists. This is not futuristic. It’s just unbuilt.

The only reason it doesn’t exist is the same reason Narcan almost didn’t:
there’s no immediate profit in building it. Once the public demanded Narcan as a necessity, companies found a way to make it. The same could be true here.

This device would stabilize people right after overdose — the exact moment they are most likely to die — and give them a safe path into actual treatment.

We talk a lot about the opioid crisis, but nobody is talking about this missing tool.
If we’re serious about saving lives in the fentanyl era, this has to be part of the conversation.

I feel amazing. Almost every day now. Even my cold hands and feet got better. I have energy. I dont need to force myself to do stuff I can do stuff and get proud and motivated that I did it.
I still smoke a little bit of weed but I had a 2 weeks break of that so its under more control now than in the beginning and I will soon try to stop completely but for now I dont want to change a running System and i reduced it to 1-2 joints a day at the end of the day.
I still take Supplements but only omega 3, zink and some Vitamines. My motivation System is still a bit fuqed though like things can be fun but after a few hours of concentration I get really burned out but that gets better too i bet!

No cravings. And I dont want to go back to opioids EVER. I love my New life. I love being clean of them. 
Thank you guys!",9

I’m dying, I’m dying. I need heroin now. I pull up my pants and tighten my shoestring belt around my no longer recognizable waist. I just got done defecating in the bushes across from Motel 6. I just got kicked out of trying to bribe them for another night. I demand you give me a free room as I enter the lobby with a bed bug in a cigarette plastic. Plus, it was still alive. Look at these bites as I take my shirt off in front of them. Scores of them all down my side. Look! “The manager says sir we found needles in your room after we switched you the night before and gave you a free room.” “So what I’m a fucking diabetic, I’m going to sue your asses” the dude scoffs and says “your insulin is heroin? There was blood in the needle not to mention the cigarette butt cottons”. 

Fuck fuck, I stormed out the door and grabbed my 3 trash bags of my clothes and everything I owned. Frail and dopesick I carry them across the street. My bowels were turning into whatever the fuck that volcano’s name is in Hawaii, where I first started using needles. I throw my bags in some bushes next to a carmax. Relieve myself. I look around and see some cardboard where a fellow heroin consumer musta have slept with ants and old clothes. I fall upon my sweet sweet heroin King mattress. I’m really sick. I’m dying I kept repeating “fuck” was used probably 600 times that day.

I text my buddy who is down a mile at a different motel for a get-well shoot. No reply. OF course, not its 11 am junkies don’t wake up, and if we do, we are usually too busy trying to find a vein.  I grab my 3 bags of my world and huck 2 over my shoulder and one under my arm and start walking. Having to stop every 5 steps to adjust my too-big of thrift store Levi’s. I was a snail that was dopesick, leaving a trail of snot behind with each sacred limp to my drug buddy’s shit motel. Cars are buzzing by honking. Yelling words I didn’t care to be called. As long as I got my dope. Fuck this left my bags halfway in a bush behind a Del Taco and ran. Checked my phone and he said room 191.

It’s 12:30 pm now. It’s 90 degrees. I’m 104 pounds and wearing a hoodie. Colder than hell, I pound on his door like a SWAT team. No answer…. mother fucker. Louder knocks…he texts come back in 30 I’ll have a shot ready my dealer is in here he doesn’t like you. Fucking flaco. 2 hours later I’m shivering behind a dumpster. He texts “cruise up”. Thank fuck. I run like junkie Gump. Bang bang, he opens. “Wtf man” I moan smacking my arm. He is loaded and passed out. “Nodded out lol, here” he handed me a pre-loaded rig. “You gotta go he’s coming back.” Fuck fuck fuck…. I run down stairs

I ran back to Del Taco where my bags were at and used a token for the bathroom and had to order a 39c taco. I roll my sweater up and had no veins. Fuck. I was dehydrated. Did push-ups. Nothing. fuck. Okay, let’s go poking. Finally, I managed to find a vein, and I missed half the shot. Fuck it, snot dried up stomach cramps gone. Eyes dried up. It’s 4 pm I can now start hustling for 20 bucks for my next shot. I leave the Del Taco semi-high, grab my bags, and start walking to a Walmart…..and so it goes ….

119,1nc5elj,About to hit 1 month clean from 400-600mg of oxy a day (cold turkey),[deleted],30,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1nc5elj/about_to_hit_1_month_clean_from_400600mg_of_oxy_a/,"About to be 1 month clean from roughly 400-600mgs of oxycodone a day. I was desperate to quit for months as it was destroying my relationship and my work and was no longer fun to use, it was just a weekly tax that stopped me from being sick. I was spending roughly $7000 a month on longtecs and basically stopped me working (self employed) and caring about about anything.

I went completely cold turkey and it was excruciating. I was twitching, sick, not sleeping for the first 5 days. I then bought a few blisters of xanax and managed to knock myself out for a few days. I've been addicted to valium for 10 years but don't ever up my dose. However the xanax gave me painful withdrawals.

I've been through H withdrawal before (smoking it for 4 months) but a year of oxy was 10x worse. However nowhere near as bad as benzo withdrawal which I wouldn't wish on anyone.

2 weeks after stopping was surprised to start getting my energy back and a bit of sleep. I have very little opiate cravings at all. However now close to a month and don't have my appetite back - I've actually lost a lot of weight since stopping.

I've now finally been able to travel again, I was trapped for a year due to the addiction. The best cure imo is leaving all your triggers behind and moving elsewhere. I wiped my phone and cut ties even with close friends which I feel incredibly bad about but will have to explain once I'm sober longer.

I still struggle with alcohol and coke but nothing beats not having to wake up everyday wondering how to score oxy and feel sick of the disgusting amount of money you spend on them.

I work freelance and made some terrible decisions while on oxy, and have come out sober but also minus 500k to almost zero and pretty much rebuilding my financial life / family life again.

There is always hope, I was afraid to ask for help but worked through it with my partner for 2 weeks while sick.

I've been through suboxone detox before but nothing beats the feeling of achievement of stopping cold turkey and dealing with it on your own.

I was searching this sub before I decided to detox, looking for hope so thought I'd leave a note here.

I won’t get into the mental issues I have because I literally have no idea who I am right now in my head. My brain developed with opioids not without my whole life and experience is with help from opiates for anything I’ve done or achieved. 

But so many people on here don’t have legit pain that needs help. It makes quitting 10x harder cause now not only do you have no relief your in major pain.

It keeps pulling me back man, like I have been on a rocky year quitting percs to subs to norco to this bullshit tobacco shop shit that really cost me. 

I’ve become increasingly suicidal to just say fuck it cause my whole mind was developed with opiates, I legit hate and kinda self harm myself because I’m a shell of myself without opiates and I hate the person I am without combined with the pain it breaks you.

Me and P were super close, we were together pretty much every single day for 6 years, half of high school and all of my college, lived together for a year. After that, i had 2 kids immediately after graduating from college, so i didnt really see him anymore.

P is the child of 2 alcoholic parents, and he got started drinking and smoking really young.  In the years since, hes had about every bad thing happen to him that can happen to someone with a poly drug addiction. His life would fall apart, hed go to rehab, get a job and car and apartment. Then hed go back out, crash the car, lose the job and end up homeless. Like 20 times of that cycle. You guys know how it goes. So the last time he ended up in the hospital with sepsis and multiple infections, mrsa, wounds, the works. He wasnt expected to survive. His mom didnt bother coming around. His dad came by and told him 'looks like youre not going to make it so im going to turn in the plates on your car.' P said ok. Nothing else to say i guess.  Idk why, but that hit me hard. 

So hes made it over 2 years sober now. Hes a carpenter now, works for a builder and hes a foreman. He and his mom bought a townhouse together. Last time i talked to him when right when he got out of the hospital. Hadnt seen him in probably 7 or 8 years.

Hes just such a great person, kind of a space cadet, so funny and under it all just a really caring sweet fun guy. Im just so thankful to see him doing good. I was thinking about it this morning and came to tears, thinking about how his addiction has caused him to suffer all these years. 

I was really thankful to see him. It was so nice to sit down and talk recovery and life with him and our other friend, who doesnt have any addictions, but is as caring and understanding as a 'normie' can be. I dont know why im sharing all this, but i just felt like i needed to. As long as we're alive we still have a shot to recover.",3

I caved. In my head it was going to be great. After a break it would feel good again. And I know this is dumb but as my withdrawal was so fast I really thought it was going to be an easy thing to do and recover from. The devil on my shoulder taking I know.

Something happened today to make me extremely angry. I work full time and Im not on a bad wage but my god living expenses are so high I feel like I'm in poverty. I lost it for a while.

I can't speak about recovery but it was a total waste of time and money. I literally got zero out of it. No good feeling, nothing at all. I feel guilty for caving but it really showed me how little this drug was doing for me. I got absolutely nothing from it and I don't think I'll be going back any time soon. It was such a build up and such a let down.

I'm grateful really for it teaching me this lesson. I'm going to restart my counter from tomorrow but I'm not going to forget the progress I made. This is still on. I slipped and it did nothing for me. I'm done here. ",15

I wanted to switch so I could hoard it and sell it to get more food and whatnot, ended up getting caught and given a choice of taking the sublicade shot instead of getting weened down off suboxone 2 mg every 2 days or something even more dramatic lol. Got the shot and told myself I would only get it once instead of every month because my buddy had it once and never again, said he never had withdrawals what so ever. Got the shot October 10 2024, November 10th 2024 a guard came to my cell and woke me up telling me it was time for my next shot and I refused. He asked if I was sure because he didn’t want me whining about it later because I won’t get it.

It’s now July 4th 2025 and I’m straight chilling no opiate use what so fucking ever. Been out since January and I take nothing except my Valium and adderall. Never had any withdrawal. I would recommend this to anyone 1000x over staying on methadone or whatever the fuck else is out there. I’m from Canada in Ontario and I am opiate dependency free. I’ve had a few tokes of fentanyl but that’s all, i even have a bit of a tolerance I felt like but never think that when it comes to fentanyl, never that you can do more than usual. I’ve lost 13 friends and I’ve flatlined at least 10 times, overdosed and revived at least 35 times. Maybe more and surprisingly im not retarded. I use to see an ambulance reviving someone and I would ask the other users standing around what colour he had used and who had it, then going to get that stuff myself. Anything that had carfentanil was always sought after. So ya ask your Dr about Sublicade today! (Side effects may include release from physical dependency of opiates) 

If anyone actually reads this and takes the same actions make sure to come back and let me know.

Remember lads, don’t do drugs,          Without me.

130,1leyt9r,Someone asked in a previous post if their 30s is too late to get sober...so i wanted to share this with him and you guys as well.,Due-Violinist5278,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1leyt9r/someone_asked_in_a_previous_post_if_their_30s_is/,"u/IR30Lover this is my response and I really hope it helps you brother.

I noticed yoir concern in the comments was about ""accomplishments."" I dont blame you for asking. But accomplishments mean two very different things to me now in sobriety as opposed to being in my addiction. Materials? Career milestones? Financial gain? These are all idolized in the world I was in when I was addicted. They were also all that mattered to the people around me. They determined self-esteem and my personal worth. Ironically, I was an utter, complete piece of dog shit and seemed to have no real grasp of myself.

My brain was running on opiates for 20 yrs. From age 17 to age 37. By 37 I had lost my business. Lost my children. Lost my license. Lost my car. Filed for bankruptcy. I was a convicted felon never to be able to get a job at a McDonald’s, let alone something serious for my age. All relationships were gone. I had stolen from everyone. I had almost died from endocarditis from using IV drugs. My fiancée had died. My little sister had died from fentanyl after I had introduced her to opiates. My mother had turned into a miserable drunk in response.

I had literally no one. I had grown up in a wealthy area in North Florida. All of my friends were Drs and lawyers. I myself was kicked out of law school due to pawning something that turned out to be stolen. And here I was, 37. Unhireable. Not a single human to answer my phone call. Homeless, nowhere to sleep. And btw, I was high at work. Stepped off the ladder the wrong way and was now literally disabled. Completely blew out my ankle. Didn’t get the proper treatment and was now handicapped. I needed crutches to walk. So I’m a crippled homeless man withdrawing from dope and also dying of hepatitis C. I catch a ride to an AA meeting and a girl who knew me from years prior of trying to get clean gave me a hug. I broke down in tears and I asked her to help. That night she connected me with somebody at a sober living place.

If it hasn’t gotten this bad for you yet? Consider yourself lucky.

When I came into AA for the 4th or 5th time, I knew the drill. I knew if I did what a sponsor told me, I would get better. I put my ego aside. I had read enough business books and positive thinking literature to understand the value of a mentor and how his successful patterns would be kinetic. Life is a sum of patterns, habits, right? I’d adopt new ones.

A.A. was culty. I hated the religious aspect of it (or so I thought). And the first step is believing in a power greater than myself. It’s establishing a baseline. A psychological rest stop, a father to hand our problems and our faith over to. Because the hole we dug was high and our shovel was broken. I am so grateful I had had some time during incarceration where I had been connected to something higher than myself. I knew there was something buzzing out there that was real. Reading the Big Book and being able to actually feel something inside as I read certain sections of the book.

I had a ""spiritual experience"" in my past so I knew this is what came with the steps and the process. The thing that helped me this time around was viewing the AA meeting house like a battery. God existed to me at a specific higher frequency. In order to be in tune to His station, I have to maintain a vibration. In my addiction, my vibration was low. Thinking was low. Self-image, mood, aspirations— all of it was low.

So to be in tune with God, I had to plug in and charge up. When I physically could not be there, I had to maintain this vibration with actions, communication, and reading. So an AA meeting would charge me up. Reading the Big Book. Talking to other addicts or alcoholics. And most importantly, calling my sponsor. I had to call him every single day. If I wanted to adopt his life (a happy man with a wife and kids who admired him), then I would need to copy his behaviors.

So I would run my sick and unhealthy thinking through his processor every a.m. And man, for a guy who lost his father at 8 yrs old to drunk driving, having a man I could call for the first time in my life every single day— who would listen to every single one of my problems, bad ideas, and plans— and then he would say, “OK, this is how you should handle this”? That was something I had been missing my entire life that I didn’t realize I needed. It brought a lot of peace and confidence my way.

To make a long story short, I now operate in a different realm. One where “success” is measured by my relationships with other human beings, by love in my heart, and by peace and happiness. Almost 3 yrs later, there is a calm I feel now. It’s unlike anything I ever experienced, even before my addiction. I bootcamped sobriety pretty damn hard my first year. Several meetings a day. And while it’s the toughest and hardest part of getting clean, there is almost something I miss about it— the grind. The struggle. The fire under my ass.

I ended up getting reconstructive surgery on my leg. I started going to the gym for the first time in my life and getting into good shape. I can walk again. No more hepatitis C and a doomed liver. I have my own place. My kids live with me full-time. I have custody back. I’ve built a business that has just blessed me beyond anything I can imagine. I literally built it on crutches with a cellphone in my hand while being broke, newly sober, and sleeping on my grandmother’s couch. And now me and my kids travel all over. We can do whatever we want whenever we want. And the most important thing is we do it all together.

Am I successful? Yes, I’m happy. I’m at peace. People can depend on me. Every morning I wake up, it’s a blessing. It’s a gift that I am excited about taking on. And if you’re asking whether or not you will have this? If it’s too late for you? I’ll tell you no, it’s not too late. And what God has in store for you? You are unable to conceive with your wildest imagination. In 2016, I sat on my bunk bed in a correctional facility reading a page in the Big Book, where it made me a promise to me. When I read it, I got goosebumps. I will never ever forget that moment. Because the promise was big and it was appealing to me. It was what I wanted. And I can tell you, my friend— it came true. I’ll share it with you:

"" Established on such a footing we became less and less interested in ourselves, our little plans and designs. More and more we became interested in seeing what we could contribute to life. As we felt new power flow in, as we enjoyed peace of mind, as we discovered we could face life successfully, as we became conscious of His presence, we began to lose our fear of today, tomorrow or the hereafter. We were reborn.""

131,1jlv4zv,Methadone Stigma,[deleted],29,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1jlv4zv/methadone_stigma/,"I'm just posting this to say that if you've spent years fighting opiate addiction ON and OFF, and feel like there's no way out, and are like I was, completely disregarding maintenence, specifically Methadone or have tried Suboxone and still couldn't stop thinking about Opiates, you really should at least consider methadone. 

I tapered as low as I could stand off Fent, made it to almost nothing, literally grains a day, so small you couldn't even see it, and I still couldn't function so after a few people suggested methadone I finally said fuck it and went to the clinic. I know people who are still on it and some who used it to maintain and regain stability while tapering, but the one thing I feel is important to stress is that IT WORKS.

Stop feeling guilty or like your giving up on sobriety for considering it. If you're on the right dose all it's gonna do is take away cravings, make you feel normal with a bit of pain relief if you have chronic pain outside of withdrawl, and most importantly, keep you from caring about getting high anymore. Your receptors will be satisfied and you'll resume life as a normal, contributing person, capable of going to school, working, forming relationships, etc.

The trick is to be honest with yourself, you'll know if your taking too high or too low of a dose. In the beginning it's crucial to play around with the dose to see what's too low and what's too high. It took me about 2 weeks of starting at 20mgs and going as low as 4mgs for 3 days, 5mgs for another 3, and eventually doubling my take home for 5mgs to realize that 10mgs is my sweet spot.

I just went back to work and didn't miss a beat, and my job is moderately physical and a quick pace is crucial. I'm finishing my GED (last test) in 2 weeks and I was able to keep about 6/10s of my savings that I kept stacking up while on fentynal the past 3 years while planning my escape from fentynal, to use the $ for Tech schhol. 

Truthfully, I don't even hate fentynal  or any opiate. After all these years I finally realize, it was never their fault for the way i am, and it might not even be mine. Without opiates I probably would have killed myself tbh. I wasn't functional day to day, and today I can honestly say methadone makes my life more normal than it's ever been. 

I look forward to each day and don't gamble with my life anymore. Stop being so prideful about sobriety, is my advice. We have no issue with tossing pride and dignity out the window and selling it for a bag when we do fentynal. We said we'd never fo fentynal, remember? We said we'd never do Heroin.. we said we'd never smoke a perc.. said we'd never steal for a habit. Said we'd never be homeless, etc. You get the picture..

""FUCK PRIDE..it ONLY hurts, it NEVER helps"" 

At the very least, try it for a few days and plan a taper. Anything is better than fentynal. Sure heroin is coming back, at least in the NE, but it won't last, and it will be laced with fent still. And goof luck ever affording an oxy habit. Go to the clinic for free, or at a small copay. Even people without insurance pay less for the clinic than they do they're dope habit. 

We're junkies, stop acting like your above maintenence, it's not just about US, we effect the people we love, most of them already consider us dead so that it doesn't hit so hard if we do, and so they can still be excited when they do see us ""oh wow he's not dead yet!"" If you can't do it for yourself, at least do it so your loved ones aren't trapped anymore, it's not fair to them.

Anyway, Just my 3 cents ",29

133,1i1s42z,Reflecting on 6 years ,mirkodup,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1i1s42z/reflecting_on_6_years/,"I used to buy a week's worth at a time.  For those on the East Coast, I would grab 7 bricks, each of which had 5 bundles in them.  I was doing 1 brick a day.  Roughly $100 a day.  This was 6-10 years ago.

There was no better feeling than coming home from a reup knowing I was good for the next 7 days, although it was more like 5 or 6 days because I always messed up and went apeshit at least a couple times during the week and did more than my allocated daily amount.  The comfort of having my drugs and no worries because I made it home safe, didn't get robbed or arrested, and didn't have to go back out there for awhile.

Then around day 4 or 5, the stress and anxiety would start to hit.  All the worrying about where I was getting the money, how much I was spending, all the debt I was in, the places and people I would have to rob next because I NEEDED IT TO SURVIVE.  Hitting up the various plugs, venturing out to P-Town where I had absolutely no business being. I've been shot at, stabbed, done the stabbing, gotten beat up, beat other people up.  Got cheated and hustled and felt truly shocked.  ""How could anyone do this to me"" I always asked myself, obviously forgetting about all the horrible things I would do to secure the drugs. 

I justified it all. I wore a suit and tie everyday to work. A mortgage, car loans, bills.  A wife and kids who I had to support. Mouths to feed. ""Normal"" friends. Absolutely no one would look at me and think JUNKIE.  But I was a junkie of the highest degree.  The biggest scumbag.  A wolf in sheep's clothing. I hid it so well.  Never got caught, never OD'd, my wife and family didn't suspect a thing. I was living a lie, but which life was the lie and which was real? I didn't even know anymore.  Survival mode for years. Locked in and focused on making money, legally and illegally, so I could support the use. 

Trying over and over and over to get clean without admitting to anyone how badly I fucked up.  How could I ever admit something like that? Someone like me being a heroin addict? No fucking way.  I could never take the embarrassment and shame of it all.  What would my wife think? What would my family and friends think of me. They would see the absolute loser I really was and I was never going to let that happen.  Not while I was living anyway.  

I would build up the courage to quit. Brace for the shock of cold turkey withdrawal. Still had to wake up with the kids and get them ready for school.  Still had to go to work.  Still had to coach, go on camping outings and be the perfect husband and father I so foolishly duped myself into believing I was. Throwing up constantly, shitting my ass out, sweating, the body aches and pains, the feeling of NEVER GETTING COMFORTABLE.  The sleepless nights laying next to my wife in bed while she was sleeping. Through sheer white knuckle willpower I tried not to toss and turn... waiting for her to finally go to sleep so I could retreat downstairs and suffer through the night alone. Every night feeling like hours. The dread of dawn coming when the kids would wake up and I would have to face life without drugs.  

This wasn't sustainable.  I would make it 3 or 4 days.. a week tops. I couldn't take more than that.  Behind on work, wife getting concerned that I wasn't getting better from my ""stomach flu"", I had to pick up.  I promised myself a taper, use benzos, use cocaine to come off Heroin.  I tried everything.  Being sober never could actually stick.  How could it?  I was living in my own personal hell.  No one to talk to about it.  Alone in the pit of despair that was my conscious. I cannot describe how it felt. Thoughts of ending myself came often. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy. 

What a fuckin joke it all was. All for what?  So I could be numb for a few fleeting moments.  It didn't even feel good anymore.

This is already longer than it should be so I'll fast forward. After a couple years of the above cycle, I finally got arrested.  I ran out to get pizza for the family and didn't come back.  After hours and hours and hours the police finally let me make a phone call.  I called my wife to come bail be out of jail.  She was worried sick about me.  She thought I died.  I wasn't picking up my phone obviously, the police had it. Like the perfect wife she is, she didn't ask questions. She came straight to the jail and bailed me out.  

The jig was up. I broke down and told her everything. I'll spare you the details but to say she was pissed would be putting it mildly. Rightfully so. 

I was on the brink of losing my wife and kids.  I now had felony charges.  I was facing losing my professional license and my career of 18 years. My employer fired me.  Even with all this, I felt better than I did in years.  I finally could talk to someone about my addiction. The secrets were over! Something I never though was possible.  After opening up to my wife, I told my siblings, my parents, my in laws.  Everyone who was close to me.  And god damn I was never called a loser junkie.  All the fear I had was bullshit.

Finally, after being open and honest and with the support of my friends and family, I got clean.  It still wasn't easy, but holy shit was it easier than keeping all those secrets.  I could actually open up and talk about all these feelings that were creeping back.  I joined one of the fellowships. Holy shit there are other people out there who are just like me?  And they made it out the other side?  I couldn't believe it. I wasn't unique and I wasn't alone.  

6 years later and my life is back. My wife and I made it out the other side, we have a better relationship now then we ever had.  My kids are growing up, almost done with High School.  I can be there for them. Really be there without the fog and distraction of an opiate addiction.  My finances are back on track. I started over. I got a second chance.  I was able to hold my professional license and career because I was honest with the regulators about my addiction, it is a disease after all and I was getting treatment. I have a new better job now. 

That's pretty much my story.  If you made it this far your a champ.  I know I'm not some eloquent writer. I just want to say if you're out there struggling like I was then TELL ON YOURSELF.  There are people out there who who will love and support you.  Society loves a comeback story and is very forgiving for the addict who is trying their hardest to come back. 

DO NOT DO THIS ALONE. Find support, talk to people, be open and honest about your feelings. If you want it then fucking get it.  Do it like your life depends on it, because it does. You are worth it. Legends are born in the valley of struggle. Become a legend.

Major fentanyl users who have managed to abstain for >4 years now. I was curious if any recovering opiate addicts have had experience with the following: my SO avoids sleeping like the plague - it leads her to often nod out almost similarly to like we used to when we were actively using. Important note: she is not using and I am 100% positive of that. 

The main reason I’m posting this is cause I’m curious if any recovering addicts have ever had a similar urge to do this. I personally love sleep and am an early riser. She is a night owl, but over the years it has gotten worse and worse. Nowadays I wake up at 4-5am to start my work day and she’s still awake and doom scrolling or nodding in the bathroom and getting to bed around 5-6am. I have to wake her up at 7am usually for reasons I won’t get into, but you can likely guess and then she’ll usually go back to “sleep-ish” (sleeping at the table, in the bathroom, etc) or sometimes will go to bed and then I wake her up again at 2-3pm.

Any input on a shared experience is appreciated, but please note: she is not using and that is something I am 100% sure of. My thoughts have been that this is some type of mental health issue. She speaks with therapists and psychiatrists but they have no valuable solution or input.",153

I don’t call myself healed. I call myself still here. That’s the only badge I wear.
If you’re tapering, if you’re cold turkey, if you’re on day 1 or day 1,000 your survival is the proof. You don’t have to be perfect, just present. You don’t have to glow, just breathe.
And if you feel like you’re alone, you’re not. Some of us built rooms out of our scars, places where you can bleed words instead of relapse. We call it UndergroundGods, but really it’s just people who get it.

138,1lrs0ph,Kratom helps with withdrawals… Psilocybin helps with staying clean why is no one mentioning this ?,Decent-Fun190,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1lrs0ph/kratom_helps_with_withdrawals_psilocybin_helps/,"Alright, I’ve been sharing a lot about kratom as a tool to get off opioids. Some people react positively, others are strongly against it and I get both sides. What I’ve noticed though, is that many people basically just swap their opioid of choice for kratom and assume that’s enough.

In my opinion, if you use kratom to get through opioid withdrawal, you should also plan to taper off it as soon as possible.

From my own experience, that’s when the real mental battle begins — the cravings, depression, endless thought loops… Psilocybin (mushrooms) helped me break those patterns and gave me a true mental reset.

And yet, hardly anyone talks about psilocybin in the context of addiction recovery. People struggle for years with methadone, Suboxone, even kratom — I see it all over Reddit — but rarely do I see people mentioning psilocybin as part of their recovery process. It’s not a magic pill, but honestly, it’s the closest thing to magic I’ve ever experienced.

To be clear: psilocybin won’t stop your physical withdrawals — but once you get through that phase, it can make a huge difference mentally. It’s non-addictive, not harmful to the body, yet rarely discussed when it comes to life after opioids.

For those interested: scientific research on psilocybin is already showing promising results in treating alcohol addiction, tobacco dependence, and even cocaine/crack use. The potential for mental health and addiction recovery is massive, but it’s still flying under the radar in most opioid recovery discussions.

Just thought I’d share that, hopefully it helps someone.",75

Now, I am in school for Social Services, specializing in addiction, my relationships with my family and friend have been repaired, and I am learning to love myself again.

I’m so sick of living like this. I made a year clean up until a year ago, when I started chipping oxies again. That debt I paid off started to pile back up, and my use got higher and higher. 

By Christmas I was in full dependency, taking 90-150mg of pharma oxy per day. It was a Herculean effort to make my pills last through the holidays, but I did it. Unfortunately when I got back and got paid, I ramped right back up. 

I’ve half-asses tried to taper my oxy, but I always find a reason to take just one more, just one more, ok maybe another half… you know the drill. 

I’m petrified of being on subs long term. I’m very scared of experiencing acute withdrawals for a month. 

My goal is to only use the subs for about a week, using less and less each time to hopefully give myself a relatively soft landing into sobriety. Has anybody found success in this method?

I’d appreciate any feedback on my plan, or your experience using subs either long term or more in a rapid taper like I plan.

It’s been years since I have engaged with any online communities dedicated to opioid use. Back when I started using, 2012-ish, I was very into tumblr and I used to browse Jinxie’s Natural Habitat and I was very active on Reddit. I just remembered that blog, and it made me think to check up on the Reddit communities and see what’s going on. All these years later, it’s weird to think about and hard to even imagine that was me. 

Anyway, I’ve been completely clean from heroin/fentanyl for 5 years in November. My life is pretty normal now.  I remember my days of posting on Reddit looking for help with withdrawal, trying to manage the balancing act that is life with a heroin addiction. Eventually the heroin wasn’t heroin anymore and the game completely changed. Sometimes I credit my recovery to that fact alone, because fentanyl was nothing like the stuff I first started using. 

I just want to let you know that if you’re going through it right now, in any capacity, you’re going to be okay. Withdrawal sucks, but it’s nothing compared to a life of dependency. Just get through withdrawal and move forward, one day it will be a distant memory. We all end up dependent on one thing or another, let it be the pleasures of living a normal life.

Tldr: methadone is actually pretty great, if you're truly ready to fight your way off opiates. Happy to answer any and all questions. Heck, I'll give my opinion on your situation and a recommended road map if you want. 

I'm prescribed 300mg gabapentin for restless legs and it's been very helpful for this whole process. 

A bit of history. I'd say I spent 7 years on and off hooked on fentanyl. Started around 2017. I was sober most of 2020 with the exception of a pill I had mailed to me (stupid). Had a few months sober here and there. 

35m and I'm a bit of a mixed bag. Sharp, educated, but from a redneck alcoholic family. Dad owned a bar, so had money and nice stuff, but everyone I knew was always drunk. 4.0 in high school, but grew mushrooms at 17. Yada yada yada.

First opiates were codeine and morphine pills a friend stole from neighbors he was house sitting for. Apparently their medicine cabinets were loaded with expired pill bottles like you wouldn't believe. There were 6 of us - 3 guys and 3 girls - and 2 big zip locks full of misc stolen pills. Tramadol, codeine, morphine, seroquel, ritalin, ativan, and I don't remember what else. I do (kinda) remember 2 weeks straight of skittle parties every day after school. 

Then I didn't touch opiates for nearly a decade. Hurt my back at 25, got morphine from a neighbor, jumped to blues a couple years later, and you all know how that goes. 

Ended up ruining a 4 year relationship, lost the woman I intended to marry, spiraled for a bit. Fought it, fell back, fought it, yada yada, almost killed myself more than once. The war stories I could tell. 

So how'd I get off...? 

----------------------------------------

----------------------------------------hammer time

Was at 4-5 blues a day at my worst, mix of smoked for the rush and snorted for longevity. More often though I was doing 2-3 a day. March last year I tried to taper myself off fent, took a week off work, got down to a quarter pill a day but couldn't get off, was back to 1-2 a day by start of April. 

By May I became desperate. I had never wanted off this badly. It was like something shifted mentally. I was willing to do anything. I literally thought about just stabbing my dealer. I cut my debit card in half to make it harder to get cash. Didn't really help. 

I had always avoided methadone because of horror stories from a friend who was on it 3 years and struggled to get off, then just relapsed. I was desperate though. 

Started methadone mid May 2024. First tapered off Xanax I'd been casually abusing, then last fent dose was June 2nd. 

I was scared, and had LOTS of experience trying to taper myself off fent (once successfully in 2021), so convinced the doctor (nurse wasn't having it, tried to fight me) to let me start tapering methadone immediately. 

Started at 65mg methadone, dropped 5mg per week a few weeks, then 3mg per week starting around 35mg. I took several breaks where I was stressed or just needed time for my body to adjust. Stayed at 12mg from mid October through the new year because the holidays led to several relapses in the past. 

How'd it feel? Not fun, but not terrible. I didn't have to take time off work, though I was a dick to my boss more than a couple times. Slept decent most nights. Physical withdrawals weren't that bad, but emotionally I was a wreck. 

Mood swings. Nothing was fun. It was basically 11 months of rarely having a good time and hating life, but having dealt with chronic depression and anxiety all my life, it was nothing I hadn't felt before. Just stubbornly persistent. 

I basically withdrew from the world. I have 800 hours on Cyberpunk 2077, I've read about 20k pages (mostly wheel of time), and I've watched Lord of the Rings extended edition I don't know how many times over the last year. 

Got down to 2mg. Took my last dose 2 weeks ago today. First few days I slept like shit, but otherwise felt surprisingly OK. Like tired, moody, occasional hot flashes, but better than expected. 

Today I feel mostly great. Sleep is meh, but could be worse. I'm on top of laundry, mowed my lawn and worked on my garden today, in a pretty good mood. I wish I had done this all sooner. Life is beautiful. ",12

But I like to celebrate the fentanyl recovery. It’s a big deal to me. Fentanyl consumed my every thought action and emotion for over 3 years. I was a complete slave to it and just constantly obsessed with using it and getting more. Even for the first year after I quit my cravings haunted me like a goddamn monster and my body still hurt and I was so tired and miserable. I relapsed a lot. The pain is so hard to deal with. 


But I wanna say this to anyone who needs to hear it. I haven’t touched fentanyl in over five years. I go months at a time now without even thinking of it. I very rarely feel even a mild craving for it or any opiate. In the last year I’ve consistently reported feeling absolutely zero physical pain to my doctor at my monthly check ups. 

I used fentanyl all day every day for 3 years and I felt so fucking hopeless. It ruled my life. My brain. My soul. I was so certain and so scared that even if I managed to stay clean, the overwhelming obsession and desire would never leave me alone. 


I go months now without even thinking about it. And I know you can too.

Opiates destroyed my adulthood.,Historical-Love-4097,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1odpqce/alcohol_destroyed_my_childhood_opiates_destroyed/,"Something that clicked this time around getting clean was why I got high in the first place.

My brother and I grew up in a single mother home, she divorced my father when I was about 9 and he was about 13. We had lived in an apartment that was supposed to be temporary until the whole family moved to a house in CT. We would look as a family and then one day our mother woke us up to go say bye to our father. It was sometime in the Fall.

After that, shit went downhill fast. My brother started sneaking off to smoke weed with his freinds, drink even tried coke around that age and pretty much whatever else he could.

 We were told out father was a ""functioning alcoholic"" and he was for sure, but he was a pretty easygoing drunk. He didnt hit us, he didnt verbally abuse us, pretty much the opposite tbh. He was excitable and fun to be around. Sometimes it sucked cause after the divorce he was pretty depressed and seeing my father cry, at my age, as a boy learning to be a man, it was kinda crazy to see. Im not judging, but here I am a kid, and I feel like I gotta lift this guy up thats supposed to be doing that for me. Still though, in comparison to what it was like living with our mother, it was kind of a blessing. 

Our mother was, according to herself, a ""weekend warrior"" she'd go out everyday from Thursday to Saturday and get hammered. Thing is though, she was also a bartender Monday Through Thursday. She grew up in alcoholic home herself and all 3 of her brother died from drinking. 

No one could put fear into me like her. The only time ive ever experienced that type of fear is when I was in jail for 2 months and for 2 weeks I had a gang member trying to reform in my cell. The worst wasnt even getting the belt or beat, even though that sucked since I basically just had to sit there and take it knowing I could easily do something about it. The worst was the shit she would say and threaten. 

She'd tell us stuff like us being alive ruined her life, she didn't want us, our father tricked her into believing he was impotent. She even threatened to kill us or kill herself several times. Me and brother would just be hanging out and if she came out of the room past 10AM in the robe we knew to go into the basement and chill or leave the house, but even then she'd yell shit, or talk shit about us loud enough for us to hear. She'd throw fits randomly then go to her room and cry asking why? Over and over, and it made me feel pity for her even though it was literally about her not wanting us lol. ""Your father doesnt want you either"" 

It was pretty insane, at that same time I was expected to to well, I excelled academically and my brother not so much. We were pitted against each other constantly by her and him being bigger then me, I end up with alot of stiches. She didnt come home until around 6 or 7 and sometimes not at all. When my brother went to my dad's to live for a while, I was all alone with this insanity. Thats when it really got confusing because i had no one around to confirm how crazy she was being, so alot of the time, no matter how right I knew I was, id end up blaming myself anyway. 

She would say crazy shit, then just go blank trying to bait you, then just look at you and be like ""what?! Get a life, stop acting like a little girl"" or some wild shit like this. 

This whole period of my life and my brothers definitely fucked us up pretty significantly. I cant speak for him, but for me, now that im sober from opiates I realize so much of why I did them in the first place.

Its because no matter where I go in the world, I have this hypervigalence about everything. It kinda lied beneath the surface of however im really feeling. I overthink what im gonna say, and wonder if I even said enough, or could have worded things better. I overanyalze body language and eye contact. I want love but get afraid ill fuck it up and have trouble with silence even if its completely natural. Even when im feeling confident or self assured I constantly question it or try to reaffirm if its geniune or wonder if im being arrogant. 

This shit always surfaces when im sober, and truthfully its probably always there, but when I was on opiates I felt safer. I wasnt obviously, I was literally putting myself in more danger, but I know now why I did it and how I justified it.

It really got bad once I was homeless, it was bad when my father died and 2 months later my mother kicked me out of the house after a fight with her BF at the time and she told me ""i told you if you made me choose between him and you it would be him"" and keep in mind i was sober when this happened. She would let this guy push me around and punch me and told me if I hit him back she'd call the cops and say I hit him first.

It was truly insane, I felt trapped in a situation that just kept getting worse and my father dying made it even crazier becsuse I had no one who truly understand the situation and could get me to see reason. I think subconsciously or maybe even consciously I chose to do opiates to not onlt numb myself while being functional job wise during this insane stress, but also to live up to what was being projected onto me. If im such a burden I might as well make it worth it, and if you need someone to blame, fuck it ill be the scapegoat. At least then I can justify the amount of shit get shoveled down my throat. ""Yea she's hard on me, but i deserve it"" 

I never really got addicted to alcohol and it caused more destruction in my life then any other drug ive done. There's people in NA meeting who will roll their eyes when you bring up this kind of stuff, in my experience its usually old timers, and my best guess would be that it hits home for them. They've probably heard it from their kids and cant stand that its true. I get it, but thats doesnt make it less valid. And personally, in order for me to move past it, I have to admit it and accept it. Really understand where all this pain started. 

And trust me I get it, like I said, my mother grew up in an alcoholic home, as did my father. My father's parents werent abusive though, just slightly neglectful. My mother didnt have that same situation. They could easily say the same thing though, but it wouldnt be false. I used to think ""well we could just go back generationally and blame every generation so whats the point"" but im not looking to subvert blame, just to understand, for me, so i can heal from it and move on. I cant just pretend its all normal and all good. That shit shaped who I am today in the worst way. 

I hope anyone else battling addictions can find the strength to understand the root of their compulsions for control too. Because ultimately thats all addiction is. An urge to control emotions, attached to memories, situations or people that cant be changed, only understood and made peace with. Id argue though that most of us had no idea how to process and handle those emotions or even thought it was possible to when our addictive behaviors began. 

I know when I got serious this time, I told myself, im ready to feel all the pain, no more hiding from it. Let it all flow and in time it will get easier, and so far thats whats been happening. Snapshots of moments I suppressed all my life, probably in an effort to create a memory where that pain was somehow in my control or didnt exist at all. But the thing about life is, all of your life is yours. The good and the bad, doesnt make it your fault or and doesnt mean you need to depend on anyone for the good, it just means you gotta accept it for what it is, cuz like my dad used to say religiously: ""I know you hate to hear this buddy, but It Is What It Is""

I got to work that day without doing any heroin for 8 hours already, feeling like absolute shit. Yawing, sweating, anxiety, and nausea started to set in quick. Did I mention this is my stepdads, dad’s business. So it’s not like I can just go home cause I lived with him and my mom at the time. They both worked there too. I was like 19 at the time. 

    It was a Friday and that was payday so I figured I could bullshit half the day till my hour lunch break, take a drive downtown to my guy and come back. WRONG! We had a $40,000 delivery job to take that required the box truck and not just a pickup truck like normal. Guess who was the only one of the 3 of us who could drive it, ME! :) Also had to load up all the windows and 1x4, 1x6, and 1x12, probably like 20 single windows, 8 doubles, and 2 triples. 

   When I tell you that was the longest drive of my life (1 hour), I almost went off the road just from being so inside my head. Thankfully the 2 guys with me were about my age and they already knew what was up. They didn’t really care, they did let me just hand off all the stuff and they take it into the garage of the customers house. We chilled in the A/C for a hour and by then it was time to go back. Since we didn’t take a lunch, we could sometimes leave work a hour early. So soon as I got back, I gave them the keys and paperwork to turn in and I left at 3:00(closes at 4). Went and got some and got sold some bullshit so had to wait another 2 days till my other guy had some. 😩

   Big boss man wasn’t happy, ended up getting fired and it really sucked. My mom came home pissed and looking back, I don’t blame her. I ended up progressing to fentanyl after for a little while until I OD’d for the first time and then a second time all in 1 week. This was right when Covid hit and heroin was mixed or non existent. So I ended up saying “I want dogfood(H)” knowing it was all fent, just didn’t care at the time and was depressed. 

 16 months sober and never felt better 👍🏻 Never really crave it anymore cause how much destruction it did to my life and health.

I'm still extremely uncomfortable and still feel extremely severe withdrawal, which the oxy and Deludid are not really helping but I'm so so relieved they are trying to keep me comfortable here and being so nice.

I’m a 23 y/o female, I’m a wife and a successful small, online business owner. I started oxy and hydro about 8 months ago, when I was working a little part time job and a coworker offered me a perc as I struggle really bad with back pain after a procedure I had done when I was younger. I then started buying them from someone, started doing them only to “feel good” kind of how some people drink alcohol (I don’t drink) then I started using heavier on the daily basis. Not to “feel good” but just to function and not be in WD. My husband also worked out of town and was gone like 5/6 days a week, so I was able to hide my addiction well especially since I have my own income I bought them with. I live in a different state than I was born in, and I don’t have anything to do with my own family as they’re toxic, and I hid my addiction from my in laws. I don’t have many friends, so no one knew or suspected a thing from me as I’ve never struggled with addiction in the past, besides nicotine and caffeine. In the last month, I picked up “blues” which I’m 99% are fent pills. I haven’t tested them, but I just know they’re fent. They’re the same price as regular oxys in my area, and they were a much better “bang for my buck” especially when I got a hot batch (dangerous, I know) but after doing them, oxy or hydro wouldn’t even fase me or get me out of WD. Only blues, so that became my DOC that I used HEAVILY. Well, a few weeks ago my husband came back home as he had an amazing job opportunity in our town, and him being back made it pretty hard to go meet my 🔌 , especially since my 🔌 was absolutely awful to get in touch with and often made me wait HOURS, which always put me in WD especially if I had ran out already. This led to me being “sick” every damn day. I’d wake up multiple times throughout the night withdrawaling, and had to lay in bed some days because I couldn’t move until I got my fix. My husband is ex law enforcement and also a recovered addict who has been sober for 7 years (very proud of him). I am a person who has a few health issues anyway, so he just thought it was my issues causing me to me so sick, although once I came clean about everything, he did say that he suspected it a tiny bit, but did not want to think that because he’s never had a reason to.

I tried to quit cold turkey a few times over the last few weeks, and I ended up in absolute hell, and lapsed every time. Okay, fast forward to Monday evening, 08/9/2025 I attempted to cold turkey yet again, but I was somewhat more hopeful than I had been for the last few attempts. I was in a bad mental state, but so ready to get out because this addiction has taken so much from me that I wanted to grow some lady balls and get through it. My husband cold turkey’d meth, pills, and other things and I remembered his story, so I thought I could do the same…

TW: blood, self harm, pregnancy loss, withdrawal 

I constantly vomited up bile for 18/20 hours, until it turned to just blood. In my withdrawals, vomiting, cold sweating, leg pain/RLS, anxiety, ect were my normal symptoms, but this time it was 100 times worse and I had different symptoms including the mental and full body convulsions, my eyes would roll into the back of my head and I’d hyperventilate. I take buspar for anxiety, have been on it for years, but I wasn’t able to keep anything down so I threw up my medicine although he gave it to me multiple times so I could get it in me. I suspect I was WD’ing from that as well. Then, as time went on I started having more intense psychological, symptoms that I’ve never experienced before. I am a person that struggles with anxiety and depression, but this was some serious dark hell that I went through and I’m wanting to know has anyone else ever experienced this. I only know this because he told me and he took some videos for me to see when I came to. I started to harm myself, I pulled out so much of my hair, banged my head against hard surfaces to try and bust my head open, I attacked my husband when he was giving me a bath and I scratched/bit/fought, I screamed for so many hours until I lost my voice, and at some point on Tuesday, I asked him to take me to the ER. He had wanted to take me all along, but I refused out of shame for what was really happening. I only remember bits and pieces up until this point then it went even blacker. I remember getting to the ER, the nurses getting me into a room and me begging them for help and getting my meds in my IV (I’m deathly afraid of needles so the IV absolutely disgusted me, especially since my veins were in such bad condition from dehydration). They gave me adavan, saline drips and some zofran. A lady from the detox program came in and spoke with me, and once I got more stable I talked to her more. I had an option of 5 days in detox, with no communication or visitors (I completely understand why) but my business is very important to me, I sell and grow rare, exotic houseplants that require very strict care. I don’t have anyone that could do it for me, if I would’ve been able to FaceTime my husband and tell him how to do it when they needed it then I would’ve, but that was against the rules. So I knew I’d possibly be facing thousands of dollars in losses, as crazy as it may seem.. so I opted for a different route and if I couldn’t do it on my own, then I’d go to detox and have my stuff in order before I left. The other option I had was the ER doctor give me some more adavan and send me in a 3 day supply of suboxon the following morning since the ER didn’t have any on the floor, so I’d have to wait. So I did. my husband said as the night went on, I begged the nurses to k!ll me, and eventually I started hallucinating and I thought our dogs and reptiles were in the hospital room. He said I talked to them for about 30 minutes then I dozed off. He said I kept waking up and doing that, then something worse even happened. I started “my period” when I in the hospital, since I bled and threw up all over my clothes, they put me a gown on until he was able to leave and go get me clean clothes from home. The doctor noticed some very large blood clots and asked about my period. My period has been very irregular lately, and I had no pregnancy symptoms at all. Once the doctor noticed that, he started checking me out *per my husband, I do not remember any of this*. I had an adult diaper on at this point, and in my diaper was a 9/10 week fetus I passed  and some of the tissue. I literally miscarried when I was going through hell, had no idea, and I do not remember seeing it or hearing about that.

Then, they discharged me, my husband brought me home and he said I was still in a schizophrenic rage even after the adavan, and when he got me home he helped me get a bath, try and water and my buspar in me and put a period pad on. He said when he started to tell me what had happened, I broke down screaming, crying, and threw my diaper/pad I had on against our white bathroom wall. And I did, because when I woke up the next morning, it looked like someone was murdered in our bathroom. I’ve never done anything like that in my life and I do not remember any of it. 

Fast forward to Thursday, I had to travel two hours to a clinic that proscribed me suboxon. I did not want to start subs, but I feel as if they’re my best chance to get sober as I’ve done my research and I will be tapering off. I have to go to my clinic every week, and I start with a local addiction and mental health counselor next week, because I have some deep, dark demons that have to be addressed especially after losing our baby. I have to find a way to cope with my sadness, differently than I have been. 

As of right now, I don’t feel great. My energy is low, I’m not sleeping well, but my mind is clearer than it has been being. Since I’ve lost so much blood and got so dehydrated, I’ve been eating plenty of nutritious foods, plenty of electrolytes and water and trying to spend more time doing the things I use to enjoy. 


I hid my addiction for so long because I was too ashamed to ask for help from my husband or in-laws or be honest with my husband about it, from pure shame. My parents would be so mean to me anytime I came to them with any issue, so I kind of carried that trauma with me. Not saying lying and hiding things is ok! I take full responsibility for that. I’ve taken accountability for it all, I’ve apologized to everyone I’ve hurt, especially my husband. And I’m so incredibly grateful that he has been so helpful to me. He helped me bathe when I couldn’t stand, he never hurt me when I was raging out, he makes sure I take my subs the way as directed by my doctor, ect. I’m extremely blessed, and I guess I truly had to hit ROCK BOTTOM to finally get the help I needed and I’m so ready to be fully sober in the future. That experience traumatized me so badly, that I truly don’t even want to think about using again.

Yeah, you're not like everyone else are you? I mean how could you be, you're a chronic migraine sufferer, the most normal thing to do is to seek relief.
But that's not it, is it? Because the pain relief was never enough. You need the nod. You want to completely melt into your bed, to be in the state of existence without feeling or fearing. And it's fun, it always is the first few days. Then your tolerance goes up, because of course it does. And it's fine, you'll just do 30mg today. No biggie.
Suddenly you're doing 120mg a day, throwing up half the stuff you eat and unable to stop. And I did stop. Thats the dumbest part. I had recovered and almost forgotten that somewhere in this house is the rest of my grandma's stash. Until I confessed to my mom, and she let the location slip. For 2 months I've been back on them and man, I don't even like the feeling 90% of the time. But I couldn't drink, it's so boring and also lead to me being sick.

I visited my mom Sunday, I have done days without Oxys, it'll be fine. Worst case scenario I would pop two or three and move on. That's not what happened. 
You see, in my naivety I was convinced I am too smart to go through withdrawals that are this bad. It started with one big throw up, Sunday night. Then the sweating began. I vomited bile for a whole day, went to the ER to get an IV for nausea and hydration. I was cramping up and slurring my words. The vomiting continued last night, a night I spent in sleepless agony, throwing up until my lips were bloody and my esophagus felt like a rock. I went to my doctor today, made up some bullshit about chinese food I had Sunday and how it's probably food poisoning. It's probably not. I'm just too embarrassed to admit that I went back on Oxys after all this time.

You NEVER wanna feel like this again. Two IV's and I'm still fighting to keep down sips of watered down gatorade. Oxy's don't make you happy, they make you sleepy. They numb the pain and depression, but so does weed, and that would never do you like this. Just stick to smoking, you stupid bitch. 

I'm not sure if taking Oxy now would help at all with the process, I'm tempted, but ultimately just enjoying not puking every 20 minutes. My head is splitting in half and my stomach feels like a warzone. But I think the worst is behind me now, at least I hope so.

I feel like such an idiot, I was done with Oxys, I never even really liked them. And yet....",14

I get 30-40 days then take a perc 5 to of course ignore my progress. I  quickly form a hefty habit, shut my life down and thank god I have the support and husband I do to have that liability and luxury to kick over and over. 2 weeks out of commission. I forget every ache and pain and diarreah and awful wd feeling bc I always find my way back in this position. I feel so done. I keep doing these guided meditations on YouTube and they help. 

This go around I chose to take 10 mg methadone pills all day for the last month to be normal for the holidays and then kick which is what I’m now doing. I never exceeded 5 of those a day and weaned to 20mg then jumped.

I was on that daily for 4 months.  I then upped my dose for a week to take the sublocade shot because you have to be on a higher dose to get it.  I took the shot and was on it for one month and forgot about even going back.  I was done and am still done and will never go back to being a slave to that life again.  Hope this helps.

I’m at ten months clean from fent/heroin and go to NA meetings a lot, and the narrative pushed is that a 12 step program is the only way to recover and total abstinence is the only option. I’m 24 so I’m not sure if my opinions about this are from a lack of experience, so I’d like to hear what people who have long term sobriety from opiates think about this.

Attenuation of opioid withdrawal with high dose ascorbic acid

What's up guys? Long time no see! I have stumbled upon some information that is so profound that I had to come back and visit you guys and share it with you. Please don't be afraid to give this a try and leave a comment about your results and also share with others you know who may benefit from it.

When you know that you are about to run out of your opioid of choice you need to start mega-dosing ascorbic acid (vitamin c). The studies I am going to link at the end suggest taking 300mg/kg, but we have better forms of this compound available now and I have gotten the dose down to approximately 155mg/kg by taking liposomal vitamin c instead of just the regular ascorbic acid vitamin c. This works because liposomal vitamin c's oral bioavailability is 1.77 times greater than regular oral vitamin c.

I am not joking one bit when I tell you that **taking the dose I recommended above will relieve 80-90% of the withdrawal symptoms from a serious fucking fentanyl habit.** If you don't know what I mean by the mg/kg part I will break it down: if you weigh 170 pounds you need to convert that to kilograms (kg) by dividing by 2.2, which gives us ~77.3kg. You then multiply the dose of the liposomal vitamin c (155mg) by your body weight in kg (~77.3) giving you about 12,000mg. Yes, I know, 12,000mg sounds crazy, but it's not really considering one tablet of what I am going to link contains 1650mg. 

You can buy 297,000mg (29g) of liposomal vitamin c from Walmart for $21, which works out to less than $1 a day to feel significantly better. This method is absolutely fucking amazing to use if you are actually trying to detox because vitamin c does not prolong the suffering because it is not an opioid, it just masks a very large chunk of the shitty ass withdrawal symptoms.

I will also add that I did take therapeutic doses of loperamide when I used this method to come off my fent habit. I was able to eat, sleep, and even go to work (pretty much fucked off because this still isn't a magic bullet) all because of the liposomal vitamin c.

Alright, enough from me. Here are some sources:

**Here are some peer reviewed studies on this topic and a brief TL;DR**

*1. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10836211

TLDR: Heroin addicts as patients Control group treated with conventional meds (no vit C) experienced major withdrawal in 56.6% of patients. Vitamin C group experienced major withdrawal in 10-16.6% some bias in this study however if you read into it

*2. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7572147/

TLDR: High, frequent doses of AA may also abort cravings and opioid withdrawal symptoms in those with OUD and has better tolerability than other OUD treatments.

*3. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2852062/

TLDR: Rats addicted to morphine and then put into precipitated WD with naloxone showed far less 'escape jumps and tail flicks' (sort of like RLS) when they were treated with high dose Ascorbic Acid

*4. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6686637

TLDR: In mice: vit C, when co-administered with morphine, suppresses the development of tolerance and physical dependence on the drug

*5. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5107231/

TLDR: 97 patients, half given high dose 50 mg/kg vitamin C, the other half placebo. Both groups given morphine before operation. 2 hours after surgery the VitC group self administered significantly lower morphine consumption and reported LOWER pain after 24 hours than the placebo group (only morphine group)

*6. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4183085/

TLDR: Complex study on mice basically proving VitC had a profound effect when combined with Tramadol or Morphine

*7. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25250292

TLDR: Rats had operation to fix a cannula to their vein, then subjected to 12 days of self-administration of morphine for 12 days, if rats received high dose of VitC before self-admin, they used less morphine, also, rats injected with higher doses of VitC showed significantly less symptoms after naloxone induced precipitated WD. (check out the images at the bottom of the study, very interesting)

*8. http://whale.to/v/c/stone.html

TLDR: Pilot study called *The Hypoascorbemia-Kwashiorkor Approach to Drug Addiction Therapy.* Gives more information and case studies using high dose sodium ascorbate with other vitamins and minerals.


Hopefully this will help a few people, I sure as fuck know it helped me!

I wasn't supposed to live long and was in tremendous pain so dependency and addiction wasn't an issue but I ended fighting cancer for around 11 years. Been found to have no evidence of disease. They don't like to say remission. 
Cancer took everything from me. Feels almost like having all those years taken from me. I was newly married and owned a very successful restaurant with my wife. She was by my side for 13 years before we got married. We had so many adventures, truly living a life I could only dream of. 
Then at 36 I was diagnosed with stage 4 melanoma. It was my wife that made the appointment. I had zero symptoms and now  facing death within months. She stayed with me at the beginning, surgeries and chemo, and then something changed. She moved out while I was in the hospital and served me with divorce papers. I was dieing and she left me. You want to talk about destroyed. The mountain I was facing, I was now doing alone. She abandoned me at the worst part of my life. I don't know how you can do that to someone. 
The surgeries and chemo were brutal, cancer was spreading rapidly to my stomach, intestines, lungs and liver. 
I was in the hospital allot and the restaurant closed down. She abandoned that too.  
Anyway.i honestly don't know if it was a subconscious defense mechanism or what it was. She was remarried and pregnant and I was alone.I lost everything but somehow the weeks turned into years. I've been fighting this for 11 years, lots of MRI, CT and PET scans and years of chemo and immunotherapy and I made through that hell just to be faced with this mother fucker of an opponent.
 I've taken thousands of pain pills being prescribed around 500 pills per month. 10 mg oxy, 8 mg Dilaudid, 30 mg morphine and fentanyl patches for 11 years now. I needed every one of those too. The pain was undescribable. Hundreds of staples and stitches, so many surgeries.
So here I am on my second day and this is up there with the level of discomfort I'm in right now and I've done some painful things. 
I'm done with it but damn I'm alone and would love to communicate with someone with some encouragement or something. Life has beaten me down so much. I don't trust easily. Been years and I still miss her. Don't know if I'll ever get over it. 
Anyway I know I'm all over the place but I'm hurtin. I refuse to believe that I don't have more to do. More to accomplish and maybe even find love again. I guess I'm starting to get the emotional part of withdrawal. Just started so who knows. ",85
179,1jay789,Beating opioids/long post,[deleted],22,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1jay789/beating_opioidslong_post/,"Hi guys

I just thought I would give my story with my battle with opioids  to see if I can help any people.

I started using heroin at the age of 17, to be honest I know it sounds weird but I didn’t even know what it was. I’m from the UK and was heavily into the 90s rave scene, using Molly, speed, ket but only on the weekends  when I was going to allnight rave parties. I would smoke  weed every night though. 

One particular night  I saw one of my friends smoking something off some foil but wasn’t sure what it was and they just said it was something to help them sleep from the come down and called it Brown, bear in mind no Internet then no social media . I decided to try some and thought the taste was disgusting but it immediately brought me down and it helped me sleep

This would continue for some time, just doing it on the weekends still unaware. 

Then I noticed I would do it on a Tuesday and then on a Thursday, put a long story short before I knew it I was almost doing it every day and then one day I woke up And I felt really anxious stomach cramps sweating and almost felt like I was speeding, eyes like golf balls. 

I was at work when this happened and my older friend I told him and he asked me if I’d been using heroin I said I’ve been using something called Brown. He said take this and if you feel better you need to get help,obviously that was methadone. 20 minutes later I felt immediately normal and knew it’s gotten its rotten claws into me. 

From then 17  till 24 it was a downward spiral I lost everything pretty much but luckily my mum and dad still supported me although they did kick me out at one stage. 

I was doing H , crack, benzos sometimes together and surprised I’m not dead. I was also using iv :(

4  failed rehab attempts, then my mother researched a place called detox five where basically they knock you out for five days so supposedly you get over the easiest part of the withdrawal. 

So I went there and did the protocol, like an idiot I never told them I had a benzo tolerance so I actually woke up on day two and I had to give me double the dose. 

I woke up on day five feeling obviously very tired and relaxed from the benzos thinking yeah that’s it. I did not  know  Mr withdrawal was doing push-ups in the corner waiting to smack the crap out of me as soon as I got home and boy it did. 

I literally had zero sleep for around three weeks, rls for a long time and crazily dilated pupils for a long time and  severe anxiety with no appetite or energy.   

I had no friends because they were all users and I literally felt at the age of 24 my life was over and I’ve lost my best friend, there was no information about doing protocols like taking supplements to ease things/vit c protocol and increased dopamine levels it was fucking brutal. 

But as each week/month past I started sleeping that tiny little bit more and getting my energy back. It took  me around almost 9 months to feel somewhat normal regarding the physical symptoms

Then one day I watched a movie called American Psycho, that was the day where I got motivated to go and try and change myself not because he was a psychopath ha ha it was because of his workout routine and the way he looked after himself I know it’s only a movie but still

That day me and my counsellor went to the gym and I got kind of hooked ever since on that, got talking to different people and after around four months a guy got me to do a triathlon with him which I kind of fell in love with. 

One year after that I was competing in ironman triathlons, two years after that I qualified for the world championship. but I’m kind of an extreme person but basically that’s where I was getting my dopamine from and that’s what I got addicted to

My life would continue like this competing in different sports until 38 years of age until my father died and then literally one week after I found out my wife of 10 years had been cheating on me.

So I did not want to be in the same house as her and moved out to a new area with all my belongings. One particular day I really hurt my back in the gym and I had boxes and boxes of codeine p 30 mg. These are from the previous injury but I just kept on collecting them from the pharmacy but not even taking them just collecting them. 

I popped 3  that day and roughly 30 minutes later I was like oh God this feels so nice and it made all the pain I was going through at the time go away and you probably know what’s coming next I got addicted to codeine. 

Of course they  are a different beast to H, fent/oxy

So I will get addicted to codeine from 2016 until 2018. Then in 2019 I lost my brother to cancer and started using codeine again 

Then I quit the codeine again in mid 2020 and I’ve been clean from opioid since. 

Any opioids are a fucking evil drug and some Doctors it seems to me actually want to get you on them I don’t know whether they get commission or something

I’m not sure if my post will help anyone who is trying to quit but my point is if you are trying to quit be kind to yourself in your withdrawal phase and when you’re feeling better find something that you’re passionate about there’s got to be something you’re passionate about. 

Whether it’s working out, hiking , cooking, computers, video games or whatever else

My problem is also I have ADHD so I do get addicted to things quite easily but now I just have to make sure that they’re positive things i  get addicted to

I’m assuming many posts have been written like this on this sub.   I just thought I would share my story to see if it can help motivate anyone

180,1iyzir2,1 month clean,[deleted],23,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1iyzir2/1_month_clean/,"I have one month clean from all opiates/opioids today 😀 I have NEVER been able to accomplish this amount of clean time without MAT or incarceration. I've also realized something. Every other time I've ever gotten clean, I always knew in the back of my head that I was just resting up for a while. I never told myself ""We're never doing this again."" I'm actually scared this time, and making choices that I never have. I'm trying to be as proactive as I can. I've done this for about 15 years on and off and I think I'm finally tired enough to figure out a solution. I really feel like the street fent scared the shit out of me. This was also the first relapse where I stopped MYSELF. No family intervention. No incarceration. I woke up and I was disgusted with myself. Pretty much all of my physical symptoms have subsided. Now, I'm just grappling with the anxiety and very little sleep. In spite of that, I'm extremely grateful to be alive & clean today. I did some thinking earlier about what is different this time so that I could tell others. I came up with this: This is the first time that I decided to tell myself I'm strong enough to do this instead of telling myself I'm weak. Historically, my will power has ALWAYS been for shit. I guess my point is the shit that we say to ourselves matters A LOT more than the shit other people say to us sometimes. I've always had a good support system of people who love me and believe that I can do it. I never believed I could do it. I believe it now. I just want to say to the people still using or in acutes that you can do it. It feels like it will never pass, but it does. Things get better everyday. Please dont let that wicked voice in your head tell you that it's all for naught. You DESERVE to reclaim your life. ",13

I prayed and prayed for months for God to get me off this medicine because I knew I could never do this on my own. Weaning wasn’t an option because we know we have it so we take it the first sign of uncomfortableness. So this is what happened. The pharmacies I was getting my rx filled from no longer would fill them because the doctor got red flagged. Okay so I found a different place that had the exact one I took. Guess what happened next, the doctor was no longer able to fill narcotics for not just me but for anyone else. Now I don’t know how spiritual some of you are BUT I truly believe that God heard all my prayers and he crashed everything around me so I could no LONGER HAVE ACCESS to that medication. So I had no other choice but to withdrawal and do it cold turkey. I am 4 days in and I’m still struggling with the restless legs and arms and also the hot/cold sweats. On my 2nd day I went to the ER for help because I could no longer bear those electrical shocks throughout my body after nearly 48 hours. That hospital told me “all I can offer you is a bag of fluids” I wanted to jump off that bed and ring his throat. Instead I took the bag of floods and drove home. I fell asleep on the freeway and the only reason I didn’t crash out was from the rumble strips waking me up. I had laid in my living room floor the 2 days prior in agony so my body was exhausted to say the least. I’m grateful and I’m thankful for this deliverance. I’m almost 40 and I want to live a pure life. I know I had to go through this and feel every bit of this so that I would never ever go back. Anyone out there wondering if you are strong enough to do it, the answer is yes!!!! I’m a mom of 3 young kids and not a single soul knew of my oxy use. Each day we wake up we are a little better.

I was 17. Still on foot, no car. That was safer — easier to run, to disappear when needed. Supposed to re-up that day. Some so-called friends walked up, acting like they were gonna dap me up. Next thing I know, black.

I wake up on the ground, someone’s kicking me in the ribs, another’s digging in my pockets. I couldn’t feel much at first. I didn’t know my mouth was literally hanging open. They took my phone, my cash, whatever I had. I got to my side chick’s house somehow — told her to get me to the hospital.

First hospital didn’t care. No insurance? Not their problem. They said they couldn’t do the surgery there, wanted to send me by ambulance to another state. All I could think was, “That ambulance ride’s gonna cost more than I can hold.” I had a family member drive me instead — against medical orders. Doc handed me a bottle of pills and said, “This’ll get you through.”

I didn’t cry. I think I was still in shock. Maybe just used to pain by then.

Made it to the other hospital. Some doc took the case pro bono. They put me under and wired my jaw shut. Ribs broken, body full of weird fluid pockets. Couldn’t move without pain — especially this burning feeling down my neck and ears. I knew something was wrong.

They sent me home with 10mg hydros. After the surgery: liquid Percocet, 10mg per 5mL. Gave me a 5 oz bottle — I could refill it three times. But every time it wore off, the pain hit like a wildfire in my head. I read the discharge paperwork: “possible nerve damage.”

I went back. Brought the meds with me to prove I wasn’t drug seeking. I didn’t want the pills — I wanted the pain fixed. Instead, the doc walked in, hit me with a needle, and upped my dose.

That’s how it started.

Six months in, I realized I was thinking more about the pills than the pain. My jaw was healing. I could walk. I could breathe. But I didn’t want to stop. I needed them. Not just for pain anymore — for life.

And I had connections. I was already working and selling. I knew older cats who loved coke more than pills. So I’d grab an 8-ball for cheap, sell it off piece by piece, and stack pills as profit. Wholesale perks, retail coke. Simple math. Take a couple to keep myself moving. Morning, lunch, after work. Nighttime was the heavy part.

I started telling myself I was doing it for the money, for the hustle. But I was losing control.

My wife — she noticed things I didn’t. Shallow breathing. Slowed heart rate. I’d stop breathing in my sleep. She’d shake me awake, terrified.

I told her to relax. Told her if she liked the life — the house, the bags, the cars — then I needed to do me.

She looked me dead in the face and said, “I don’t want you to die in your sleep. I need you.”

I’ll never forget those words. Still brings tears. That moment was the clarity. Everything clicked.

I gave my phone to my boy, told him to hold it down, keep people from showing up looking for a fix. Took time off work. Locked myself in.

Day 1 wasn’t too bad… until hour 14. Shaking. Sweating. Couldn’t sleep. Couldn’t sit still. Seizure hit. People told me to go to the hospital. I said, “F**k them.” I wasn’t giving them the satisfaction. I knew if I stepped foot in there again, they’d slap a label on me: “addict.” And I’d never get taken seriously again.

Day 2 was worse. Piss, shit, sweat, vomit — all at once. Felt like my body was on fire. Couldn’t keep water down. Muscles locked up so bad I couldn’t even stretch without cramping. Couldn’t eat. Couldn’t walk.

Day 3, I was still in the shower, curled up, water turned cold. My body was rejecting life. My mind? It was on constant defense. Thinking. Planning. What if someone comes? What if I break?

Day 4, I managed a banana. An apple. Maybe some bread. Still wanted it, but I could stand. Could walk. Wasn’t convulsing.

Day 5, I had pride again. I didn’t win the war, but I survived the worst battle.

And even now — years later — I still twitch. Still get spasms in my sleep. Maybe it’s nerve damage. Maybe it’s just what happens after you put your body through hell.

But I’m here.

And I’m clean.

Not because I’m strong.
But because someone loved me enough to say, “I need you.”

And because I finally believed them.",2

To Anyone Out There Struggling With Opiates:

I see you. I know the war you’re fighting — not just against the drug, but against the guilt, the shame, the grief, and the lies your mind tells you when you’re at your lowest. I’ve been there. I know what it’s like to feel broken, like you’re too far gone, like the damage is too deep to ever come back from.

But here’s the truth — you can live again. You can build a life in recovery that is stronger, richer, and more meaningful than anything you ever imagined. And not only that — you deserve that life.

Recovery isn’t easy. It’s messy, painful, and raw at times. But it’s also beautiful. It's waking up without chains. It’s laughing again. It’s rebuilding trust. It’s finally looking in the mirror and seeing someone worth fighting for. I’m not just speaking as someone who hopes it’s possible — I’m speaking as someone who knows it is. I'm living proof.

If you're in the middle of the storm, if you're barely hanging on, please hear me: you’re not alone. You’re not weak for struggling. And you’re not beyond saving. Recovery is not about being perfect — it’s about being willing. Willing to try again. Willing to reach out. Willing to believe, even if it’s just a little bit at first.

If you ever need someone to talk to, someone who gets it without judgment — I’m here. Reach out. I don’t care if we’ve never met. I’ll listen. I’ll be that hand reaching back when you’re slipping.

We do recover. One day, one choice, one breath at a time.

With love and respect,
S....

Need help pls,pinkestman,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1jhd5r7/how_can_i_quit_this_drug_use_cycle_need_help_pls/,"I never had big ambitions. Growing up, I floated through life, unsure of what I wanted. In my teens my social anxiety kinda stared to ruine my life, so trying to find a solution i started using stimulants and other drugs two years ago. At first, they were perfect .They gave me confidence, improved my depression, and even made me a bit ambitious. I wasn’t addicted to them at least it didnt feel like i was. 

Back then, my drug use wasn't that bad and manageable. I’d use substances occasionally, using them for productivity mostly. But over the months i tried more and more and it keept getting more regular. Until now where my use is often multiple substances daily.

Then I found nitazenes. Normal opioids weren’t pleasurable for me, I tried everything over time it wasn't no more about productivity more about escaping from who i am. I even tried to shooting up heroin but really only nitazenes did it for me. They erased everything. No anxiety, no loneliness, no thought about my future. I didn’t care that my life was stagnant or that I was destroying myself. For two months, I used them daily, chasing that void. I nearly overdosed and felt nothing no fear, no regret. I didn't really saw the problem in dying unexpectedly peacefully.

Three weeks ago, I quit opioids mainly becaue i ran out. But now I’m worse off than ever. My mind is hollowed out. Without stimulants, I’m paralyzed. I’ll lie in bed for hours, unable to do anything really. Simple tasks, feel impossible. I got into stimulants again just to survive, but they don’t work nearly as effective anymore, almost just to feel normal i have to take them. I can take meth and continue to lay in my bed without any motivation for anything. No joy, no motivation, just mechanical existence.  
I can't quit drugs, If I do if feel like I'm going to lose my job and fail school. But I also can't continue doing what I do otherwise my liver is going to fail on me with only 20 years old.

Opioids broke something in me. They made me numb to how broken I was, and now even though I’m off them, I still feel numb to my nosy of my problems. My liver’s still a concern, but that’s not what scares me. It’s the psychological problems, that I can’t get anything done, can’t feel anything well except anxiety, unless I’m high. 

I know I should give myself time to recover, but I really don't know how people are able to get off drugs for more than a year. I keep thinking about opioids even tho they fucked me up. And even if I never touch them I'm still stuck in a loop to fix the consequences from drug use with more drug use. Has had anyone similar experiences? I would be really thankful for useful comments!

I am new to Reddit. Today I have been sober from fent (and all other substances) for exactly one year. I was a real hopeless case, physically couldn’t recognize myself, mentally broken, and emotionally unhinged. I hated myself and pitied myself but somehow also thought I was better and smarter than everyone else. I thought I was invincible because no matter how much I tried I just couldn’t seem to die. I did at least one terrible thing every day to get what I needed. Never in a million years thought I could get better. 

I am sharing this to let anybody stuck in it know that it is possible. It did not happen in one day but the self pity is gone, the shame and guilt is gone, I have a relationship with my family and friends and MYSELF that I didn’t think was achievable. The single most important thing I did was start listening to other people who have been through this and made it out the other side. I think back and I was always “willing to do anything” to get out of hell until someone suggested something even mildly uncomfortable or unfamiliar. This time I tried actually doing all the things people had been saying might help me for years. Wouldn’t you know, all that stuff helped. Detox sucked but it helped, rehab helped, therapy helped, meds helped, recovery programs helped. 

I used to make excuses for why I couldn’t afford to do that stuff or why it wouldn’t work for me. Frankly, the only real reason i had not to try ANYTHING was that I wasn’t ready to change. As soon as I admitted that I didn’t know what I was doing, I’m not smarter than everybody else, as soon as I started letting others help me, everything got much better very, very fast. I am even kind of grateful for everything I went through because it has given me an incredible appreciation for life. I know different people get sober differently but I can only share what worked for me. Please feel free to ask me anything or DM me if you are going through it. ",11

The appointment isn't until mid-February, but the appointment is set. And that will give me time to figure out how to continue, if it is beneficial.

I don't get it. It's been almost 4 years since a loved one OD in my bed but it feel like it was only months ago. It's been more than 5 years since I quit living in squats but I have not much recollection of what I did during that timeframe beside being a terrible partner to an ex BF and some stupid borderline shit people do when their bored and drunk.

6 years and a few months ago I was in the best relationship with the greatest girl I ever met and I feel like I just slept through everything that happened after that while being high kind of all the fucking time. How the fuck is that working? The 4 years I spent with her ( not actively abusing ) felt like a fucking decade but the almost 7y after felt like pretty much nothing outside of the occasional funny BPD addict "" fun "" storie.

For me, it’s these 20-30 mins I get to sit alone in my truck and blast some music. Most likely singing along poorly. 

Or just as great if not better, when I take my boat out with my friends. One of whom is 18 months sober as well. We ride around, listen to music and sing and dance like fools. Watch the sunset, swim, etc. 

One of the things I’m the most grateful for being sober… how fuckin great music sounds. I had gotten to the point I couldn’t get that hair standing on end feeling and I had stopped listening. I hope wherever yall are tonight, you can hold onto that thing that  makes you feel so alive it brings tears to your eyes. ",29

I’m hyped to share that I’ve been clean from opiates for exactly one month today! It’s been a tough journey, but I’m still standing, and I’m proud. I take Diazepam sometimes to sleep or Clonidin to take the edge off, but the physical withdrawal is mostly gone. Now it’s the mental fight that’s real. My head’s a bit of a mess sometimes, like pure chaos in there, but I’m trying hard to stay calm, whether I’m sitting or standing, and not let it show.
I’ve been smashing it with sports more than ever. Last week, I was on Rügen, this awesome island in Germany, and me and my mates cycled 105km around it, even with withdrawal symptoms trying to drag me down. I never knew I was this strong, but I’m learning I am, and I truly feel God’s on my side, guiding me through.
Big thanks to this community! Your posts, recommendations, and tips are a lifeline and keep me focused. I’m struggling with the psychological stuff, though, anyone got tips for dealing with the mental chaos? Any tricks to stay grounded when your mind’s all over the place?
You guys are incredible, and I’m so grateful for all the support. God bless you all, and thanks for being part of my journey!",4

But my husband has. He's 2 years and 3 months clean. It's been a hard, sometimes painful journey but full of lots of growth. 

I thought I would share somethings I've noticed 2 years into this. 

He continues to work SO hard on himself. He's in therapy every other week. He stays in touch with others in recovery. Makes a point about hitting the gym as much as he can (sometimes that's 4 days a week and sometimes once a week.) 

The other day, he didn't get paid on time for a gig he did on the weekend. He was rightfully annoyed with the company (partly because he had to ask why he hadn't been paid yet instead of them notifying him of the issue.) But he also told me he felt a little emotionally triggered from it and it was linked to feelings from his addiction.  Basically, he was in such debt during his addiction, that being paid late would be catestrophic. But present day, it was fine. Annoying and unprofessional but we are okay. 

But recognizing that, I think is so huge. There are tons of little moments like that. They make me so proud of him. He's really putting in the work and it's inspiring, just as humans. ",7

I also quit caffeine and vaping the day i quit fent because I knew those two things would just exacerbate the anxiety. Obviously, I still feel like something is missing. I know from past experience that takes a while to go away. In spite of all the good, I was slightly triggered today because I received a pretty hefty sum of money (tax return). Then, I thought over the last few weeks, and the fact that I'm still barely sleeping. I'm not at all interested in starting that shit show over again, so I'll stay clean today. Thanks for listening.

Instead of asking you how long this will last… I’m asking what are the benefits of quitting? How did you see your life change positively? How did you feel once you got through it? Did you feel healthy again? Did your thoughts change? My hope and prayer is that once I get through the gnarly withdrawals that I’ll stop nodding off throughout the day and have a constant need to “nap”. I hope I’ll have less mood swings as well, because I def get opiate rage.

228,1i3pcgc,5 months. ,fuckyouyaslut,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1i3pcgc/5_months/,"I made it 5 months and 1 week today. Last December I OD’d for the first time after my first time using after a 3 month clean streak. It was also my first time ever falling out in almost a decade of using. Then a few months after that I passed out in public because I was so weak in withdrawal, that I split my face open on the sidewalk and got 12 stitches. Then a few months after that, I got clean for the billionth time (this time). 

This is the first time I’ve ever made it this far. I use Kratom to keep myself from slipping up, but lately even that feels like a cheat of some kind. Which seems ridiculous because the last few years have been hell trying to get myself off fent. So I’m trying to remind myself that I’m in a better place now. It’s not even a comparison. But I guess it’s a good sign that I feel this way right? 

I’m just not trying to get too over confident about any aspect of my substance abuse because I realize it only takes one fuck up to fuck up again. 

My life feels quiet and calm and stable for the first time and I’m grateful that it is. I’m working a lot and finding happiness in things I thought I wouldn’t give 2 shits about. Like people. And food. And activities I thought were “meaningless”, because I wasn’t getting high. I used to have to scrounge $100 daily before food, rent, any part of life. Just to get me through my day. Just to not get sick. I just couldn’t live my life like that anymore.

229,1huadmh,Day 500!,Deathofme_0,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1huadmh/day_500/,"Just hit 500 days sober today! The holidays are always a bit tough for me (since I’d always ruin them with my addiction in the past) but I’m proud of myself for getting through and happy to still be on my recovery journey after 15 years of addiction.

I’m also 80 days sober from weed which is another thing I thought would never happen. It’s funny, while opiates and weed are totally different (I have a medical card), the mindset is similar. On both drugs I thought I could never be sober, I would be awkward or people wouldn’t like me, I wouldn’t be able to survive really without them…but less than 2 weeks after stopping both; I realized the exact opposite is true. I find myself more present than ever, I feel less awkward in social situations, I’m saving even more money; and I’ve been progressing in EMDR therapy like crazy since stopping weed.

I was using weed to help stop my horrible nightmare/night terrors. While it was a good crutch, I got to a point in therapy where I felt stuck basically. I stopped smoking (only because I was trying to get a new job) and found myself making leaps and bounds in therapy I never thought possible. My therapist noticed almost immediately too! Even though I only stopped smoking for the job, I’ve decided to not start back up again! While therapy is still incredibly hard and I have a long way to go, I have made it SO far and I can’t wait to look back in another 500 days and see the results!

This year, my goal is to find an in person meeting that I can be apart of. I have been completely shocked to find how much solidarity and being around likeminded people helps me. I’ve always been someone who’s never really wanted to go, but lately I feel the need for support and want to capitalize on those feelings.

I hope anyone still in the throws of addiction that sees this, knows it’s really possible to get out, you just have to be ready! There are so many resources out there, and I’m always here and happy to help any/everyone I can. I thought I was alone, I could never be helped, and I was better off dead; but I was so wrong. 

And to my friends that are in recovery, keep fighting the good fight! I don’t post in here often these days, but I’m in here almost daily reading your inspiring stories and it helps more than you’ll ever know. Message me anytime for anything, and thank you all! ♥️",5

Is there any way out?,lucyblu663,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1hrlrpn/5_months_sober_and_still_hate_my_life_and_am/,"I’ve been sober 5 months now and I feel like nothing has changed. I feel the same, live the same monotonous life that I realized very quickly only worked for me while using and feel like I can’t get out. I have no friends and therapy and the occasional meeting is not enough, but I feel like I’m incapable of reaching out and putting in the effort to find community and connect with others. I’ve realized I’m mentally ill and it isn’t going away with being sober, I’ve tried so many medications that often make it worse and have been on various meds and in therapy since 15. I feel like there isn’t hope for a better life and I’m so tempted to give up and start using again just so it can be easier to get through the days. I’ve lost everything I cared about and so many opportunities to drug use and despite being only 23 I can’t convince myself that it isn’t over for me already, it feels like it has always been like this and always will. My issues started long before substance use but I haven’t had more than a few days sober (until now) since 16. I don’t know how to live and no one is going to hold my hand through the process of learning how to be a person. I don’t have any motivation because I feel like it’s a losing battle and I’ll never get out of this hole I’ve dug myself. I have ptsd and it’s extremely hard to connect to other people and be vulnerable enough to make new connections and trust that it will be ok, so I find myself completely alone all the time as the rest of the world gets further and further away, and my world gets so small again. I felt like this often while using and was convinced it’d be better when I got sober but it isn’t. The small amount of progress I finally made that convinced me to get sober cuz I finally had hope for the future is completely gone. I keep finding myself thinking maybe it’ll be better on my next try, as if I’ve already given up and know I’ll be using again soon. I don’t know how other people function and move forward. I can’t stop thinking about everything that’s ever happened in my life and I live completely in the past agonizing about everything, I have nothing going on in my life and nothing to bring me out of my head and I’m too cowardly to move forward and find good things for myself and do anything I know would help. I finally got a sponsor last month and have stopped texting and calling, every time I reach out I end up not responding for weeks again, I don’t speak to anyone at work, I feel like a ghost. The only thing that keeps me going is the thought of leaving here forever and just forcing myself to live, I finally got my drivers license, renewed my passport, drafted my two weeks notice- but the end doesn’t feel any closer, I don’t feel any better, it still feels so out of reach. I don’t have confidence I’ll actually do it. In my head I think there’s two options, move in to sober living in another state, find a better therapist, new job, maybe iop- or drive for a while, get out, and come back and start using again until I have hope I can make it and do better. I think so much about using and the comfort of giving up and resigning myself to waiting and ignoring again. If I don’t try, I won’t fail, I won’t ever have to realize it really won’t get better. I’m so tired of waiting for something that may never come and trying for something I might never get and feeling like I’m failing cuz I’m not ever doing enough. Even in iop, going to meetings regularly, everything I was supposed to do I felt so trapped and hopeless. I just want to know there’s some end in sight, some light at the end of the tunnel and this all might be worth it. That I can actually turn things around and have the strength to do it for myself and it won’t be forever that I feel like this. Sorry for how long and depressing this is I just want to know that someone has felt this way and made it out",29

First off, I want to say thank you to everybody who has offered their encouragement over the last thirty days. It means a lot to me. Now, I figured I'd do something a bit differently today. I've given this some thought, but I'd like to share with you guys my story. I'm not entirely sure if this will help some of you out, but perhaps it'll add a more human dimension to the previous posts I've made. I know I've kept things mostly positive over the last month, but clearly I've made some mistakes to be in this predicament. Despite what the posts might suggest, I'm not perfect. I was weak. I struggled the same as everybody else dealing with addiction. Before I continue, there are some parts that might be triggering to read, so you have been warned. Here is my story:

Nearly a decade ago, I was essentially a model student and athlete my senior year of high school. I was a varsity athlete in two sports, my GPA was nearly a 4.0, I had 10 AP courses under my belt, and I volunteered often. I was in a relationship with a girl I had known for about a year at that point. I had a solid circle of friends who shared my interests. I even had a best friend who referred to me as a brother. We innocently started dabbling in weed and alcohol on weekends during nights where we'd hang out and play video games together. Eventually, my best friend started doing drugs alone. Unfortunately, I didn't see this as a sign of mental health issues. I was busy with life and college applications at the time, and he never approached me with his issues. That's usually how us guys are, so I didn't press him further on the issue. It's one of my biggest regrets to this day. I woke up one morning to frantic text messages and phone calls from mutual friends. My best friend had run away from home. I tried desperately to reach out to him, but he disconnected his phone. I prayed he would return. The only thing that returned to me was a message late at night from an unknown number saying ""thank you for being a good friend to me. I'm sorry, goodbye [my name]"". The next morning, police confirmed that he was dead. He committed suicide by jumping in front of highway traffic. This is the event that caused my life to spiral downward. I had lost the one person I truly considered a brother outside of my own family. The anguish in my heart never really faded from that day on. I was denied admission from my university of choice and went to another in-state college, but I hated it. There was a lot of crime and homelessness in the area which made it dangerous if not depressing. I also had to commute nearly 2 hours one way using public transportation which always had some crazy people on there. There was also the issue of traffic in the mornings and afternoons just to get to the metro station. In addition, I had to work part time at a shitty entry level job to pay for transportation costs which included my used car to get to the metro station. The professors at my university didn't even teach under the pretext of an ""inverse class format"", which was awful for STEM majors like me. The point is, I felt like I worked my ass off throughout my teenage years for nothing. I began to question my own existence. One day on the way back from classes, I met a guy I knew somewhat from high school. He said I looked beat, which I was, and recommended I try kratom. I had no idea what he was talking about, but he said it was this herbal supplement that helps with mood and energy. It sounded too good to be true. I decided to give it a shot despite being skeptical, so I stopped by a local smoke shop and purchased a small bag of white maeng da. That day when I got back home, I cracked open the bag and took two grams to try it out. About half an hour later, I experienced the best fucking feeling I have ever felt in my life. It was as if all the happiness and joy I could've felt from my accomplishments up until that moment were transformed into some green powder. Suddenly, the transits to and from college seemed a lot less bothersome. I didn't have any anxiety over tests anymore. I had more energy to study and work. I was on cloud nine. At the time, I had believed I found the cure for my declining mental health. Initially, even my girlfriend was happy I found something that worked for me. However, all it did was repress my real emotions and fatigue. About a year later, I suffered a mental breakdown and had to take medical withdrawal from all my college classes for the semester. My parents were encouraging and said I should take a gap year to take a break and reorient myself. I went with their suggestion, but I began to self-medicate with kratom even more. One day, I ran out of my stash. I told myself it was no big deal, until I started feeling sick several hours later. I convinced myself it was the flu until I bought more kratom and felt better after half an hour. A realization dawned upon me. I was addicted to kratom, a plant I thought was just an herbal supplement. Panicked, I tried to stop, but the withdrawals were intense. At this point, my parents began to notice something was wrong. They found my 250 gram bags and I had no excuses. They tried to take it away from me, but I'd always hide some more that I bought secretly. The addiction began to drain all the money I had saved from work. Then, COVID rolled around and I had no job. Even the unemployment money I got was spent towards kratom. Soon, I resorted to stealing. Not just cash from my parents, but kratom from gas stations when the attendant was gone. At that point, I was eating powder by the spoonful multiple times a day. I was a fucking fiend for kratom. My girlfriend who I had known for about four years during this time saw the writing on the wall. She tried to convince me to stop, but I didn't listen. I lied and made excuses, which eventually she caught on to. That was the last straw for her. She abruptly left me, saying she hated what I had become and never wanted to see my face again. Then, my parents who found out about the stealing were enraged. I overheard my mom tell my dad ""that's not our son. He's a monster"". It was only during that private conversation that I learned I was an accident. I was thoroughly devastated. At that point, I had nothing left to lose, and yet I was determined to lose the one thing I should value the most. I drank a bunch of liquor and stabbed myself in the throat with a knife. Thankfully, I missed my carotid artery by half an inch. I was found passed out and bleeding, but alive and taken to a hospital. Then, I was sent to a psychiatric hospital. I was put on Suboxone and Wellbutrin during my stay until two weeks went by and I was deemed fit for release. I was given another week's supply of Suboxone to taper down from and that was it. Little did I know, PAWS from kratom was lurking around the corner. It hit me like a tidal wave after my last dose of Suboxone. After a few days, I couldn't take it anymore and relapsed on kratom. My parents found out and kicked me out of the house. I was homeless besides my car, but at least I still had some money. It was a few months before I found a job, and another several before I found an apartment to rent with three other people. Life seemed to be shaping up to something better, but I was high on kratom all the time so it was hard to tell. My entire life at this time was just long shifts at a dead-end job to pay rent while the rest went towards drugs and other necessities. I wasn't just doing kratom at this time either. I was getting drunk and smoking weed almost every night. I also picked up a nicotine habit. Between that and work, I did nothing else. I didn't have any friends. My entire free time was spent doing drugs and lounging around in my small apartment room on my phone. Frankly, I thought I could live like this forever. That was until kratom began to affect me differently. I began to have noticeable body tremors whenever I was anxious, and then it shifted to having body tremors all the time. I couldn't function like a normal person in public or at work anymore. At this point it had been three years since I was kicked out on the street and five years since I first knew I was addicted to kratom, so I had likely damaged my body and brain. It was not until a visiting family friend who had known me since I was a kid met me one day and said ""Jesus, are you okay? You look sick"" that I knew I couldn't live like this anymore. I looked at myself in the mirror when I came back to my apartment that day. My skin was pallid. I had visibly dark circles under my eyes. I lost at least 20 pounds in weight. I was a husk of my former self. I truly became the monster my family said I was. I decided I had enough. I got a Suboxone prescription through telehealth and for the next five months I tapered from 4mg down to 2mg per day. At this point, Suboxone had also begun to show its own side effects. I was sick of it. I called my family and explained my situation. Thankfully, they were willing to take me back. However, it was on the condition that I quit all drugs with random testing as proof. That included Suboxone. I weighed my options. Did I really want to rot away for the rest of my life as a poly-drug addict at some entry-level job living paycheck to paycheck in a shitty apartment with multiple roommates? Or would I rather get clean despite the withdrawals with zero comfort drugs if it meant I could have a fresh start and regain the trust of my family? I chose the latter. Today marks the thirtieth day since I quit Suboxone, and also the thirtieth day I began to turn my life around. For once, I can say that I am a man who survived hell and is free from the shackles of addiction for good.

Hopefully my experience has resonated with some of you regardless whether you are just considering getting clean or are currently going through withdrawals. Just know you are not alone. It is possible to beat an addiction to opiates, even ones as powerful and long-lasting as Suboxone. If I can do it, surely you can too. Have patience and be kind to yourself. Eventually, you will be free. I'll see you all tomorrow for my last daily check-in.",8

Those words were spoken to me while I was locked in a trap house as a woman's boyfriend kicked me in the head and ribs. They thought I had robbed them, and they lured me there to get revenge. This was just one of the moments from my nearly six years of being homeless and addicted on the streets of Kensington, Philadelphia.

It's a crazy story. I went from being a correctional officer to a full-time ""hitter"" on the street—a guy who injects others with drugs for money to survive. My life became a cycle of hustling, boosting, getting jumped, and running from the cops, all while battling an addiction to fentanyl and tranq that was literally eating my body alive with flesh-eating wounds.

I was completely hopeless and had resigned myself to dying out there. Then, during the brutal winter of 2024, I got severe frostbite and collapsed on the street. That single event led to a choice in the hospital: a long, painful, and uncertain fight to save my feet, or a double below-the-knee amputation.

Losing my feet was the most traumatic and horrifying experience of my life, but it was also the one thing that finally got me off the streets for good. It forced me into a recovery I couldn't run from.

Today, I'm home with my parents. I have my prosthetics and am learning to walk again, and my girlfriend Britiny is also clean and in a sober house. I've spent the last several months writing my memoir, *Kensington Beach*, to tell the whole unfiltered story.

It's been a hell of a journey. I'm open to answering any questions you guys have about addiction, life on the streets, recovery, or what it's like learning to live again.

I'd also me completely honored if you were to check out my work or even just my page. Thanks guys

Started at 17, I’m about 3 days clean at this point. For the last 3 years I didn’t even get high off the stuff it was just a bottomless pit I threw money into so I could remain functional. What’s messing with me rn is this constant restlessness and the fact I can’t sleep at all. I feel super unmotivated to do anything, I feel like I should start going to the gym or something in order to get a routine going. I’d love some advice for how you guys managed early recovery ",17
236,1nxl3yh,I’m coming up on 2 years clean and don’t really have anyone to share it with who gets it,brittynicole1019,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1nxl3yh/im_coming_up_on_2_years_clean_and_dont_really/,"Hi,

I don’t post often so here goes. 

Back in 2021 I wanna say, I started using oxy recreationally and eventually started using more and by 2022-23 I was shooting up heroine. 

I was in a very unstable and unhealthy relationship with a guy who had been using and got in to it that way. 

I ended up overdosing and coming back but didn’t even quit after that.. I vividly remember coming to and was being pissed that I fucked up my chance at getting well… 

I mentioned moving out of the city I was living in and moving closer to where I grew up to my family and they basically saved my life unknowingly. Because I moved to a city where I knew no one with the stuff I needed. They thought they were helping me get out of a toxic relationship, which they were but also before I overdosed and didn’t come back. 

I took the month before I moved to try to detox and ended up putting myself in withdrawal. I had a planned birthday vacation with my Mom in Vegas and before we left ended up in urgent care and then after we got back ended up in the ER again so she knew something was up. And so I ended up coming clean to her about everything.

There are only a select few people who know I ever used. The toxic ex and his friends. My very close group of 4-5 friends. My mom (she has tried to explain to my dad how rough of a situation I was in but he refuses to hear about it). And my now fiancé. 

So, I guess I just wanted to come on here and kinda say I’m proud of myself for not slipping and wanting to tell someone that IT’S FUCKING HARD EVERY DAY EVEN WHEN YOU ARE CLEAN FOR 2 YEARS! 

I genuinely have my friends and family to thank for getting me help out of the situation I was in. That’s my biggest advice for anyone on here looking to stay clean. Surround yourself with people who want to support you and won’t judge you! 

Thanks for listening! 
Stay safe and healthy!

But I feel abandoned I’m 21 years old I have no choice but to taper off my suboxone with only a few left I try not to take any. But I easily get depressed but some days I feel good. Like I can feel great one day and depressed the next and I don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve been trying to get into better habits and routine but every so often I get craving for drugs. I wish I never touched opiates because the feeling would’ve never interacted with my brain. If I never experienced that high I would have nothing to crave. Maybe I’m just feeling alone because my gf is back with her family for the summer and I’m so used to her being around. Maybe I don’t have enough going on in my life atm. I think it’s a good thing I’m getting off suboxone because I won’t have to rely on it. But I just hate these ups and downs my brain is fucked. Anyways this was a random rant. ,38
241,1krayt4,13 years clean and sober,skimask808,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1krayt4/13_years_clean_and_sober/,"Every once in a while I stop by in this sub reddit to share my story, to hopefully inspire the addict who is still suffering. It also gives me a chance to reflect on the things that worked and went well for me in my recovery, and the times I may have fallen short as well. To start, I am in my early 30's. I started using opiates when I was 14 years old. I remember because I was a freshman in high school. I was having a really rough time in school. Depressed, constantly anxious, and started hanging out with other people with similar issues. Surprisingly, most of my friends didn't use any substances. But I remember one day I was going through medicine cabinets at my house and I found a full bottle of 40mg oxycodone capsules. There were 120 of them. This is where it all started. 

The next week I skipped school most days, and got completely obliterated at home by myself. It was the first time in a long time that I felt truely happy and like myself. There was a switch that went off where I instantly recognized that I had found the thing I was looking for my entire life. My story isn't unlike many others, once the pills ran out, I realized I had a family member who had lupus and was being completely over prescribed opiates. Oxycodone, hydrocodone, oxymorphone, hydromorphone, and even at one point fentanyl patches. No idea what the doctor was thinking prescribing that much. But this set me off into full blown addiction. 

Eventually they noticed the meds were going missing after almost a year. So I had to find something else. This is where heroin came into the mix. IV use came shortly after. This went on for 3 or 4 years. Getting kicked out of my home, losing everything and everyone who loved me wasn't enough to stop killing myself with substances. Even losing my girlfriend of 5 years wasn't enough to stop. I pushed everyone away who actually cared, and continued using, almost to the point of trying to die for a long time. 

Then came the day I overdosed. Valentine's day, February 2012. I woke up in a hospital and a police officer was there. He gave me two options, they found heroin and needles on me and said he could charge and book me for possession of narcotics and paraphernalia, or I could check myself into inpatient rehab. Seeing my parents faces was enough to realize that this was my one chance to turn things around, and I might not get a second chance. So I checked myself into a rehab (surprising the best choice of one too) and started my journey to recovery. 

The recovery part could be a whole new post, but to try to wrap things up as quick as I can I'll just explain what's happened since then. I graduated recently with my bachelor's in Psychology, and am pursuing my master's in social work right now. Should have it in the next year or two. I got licensed in my state as a substance abuse counselor (in training).  I started working about a year ago as a substance abuse counselor, and got the opportunity to intern, and then work at the same rehab that saved my life 13 years ago. I give speeches to new patients weekly, play golf with the same psychiatrist that saved me in 2012 regularly. 

I still deal with cravings. Life still can get crazy and throw me curve balls regularly. But now instead of using I call a friend or talk to a loved one about what im going through. I cope with stress differently now, helping others truly does help me. What I am trying to say is no matter how dark things can get, remember that there is always a way towards recovery. In beginning it can be incredibly hard to stay sober, but after you have a little bit of time, it gets so much significantly easier. You can find out that you do deserve happiness and you do have something positive you can contribute to other people's lives too. Traditional 12 step groups work for a lot of people, but I didn't use them to get sober and don't teach too much about them when I'm running groups. There are other ways to stay sober. 

To the addict still suffering, and the ones who are just starting your recovery journey, keep fighting. Don't give up, no matter how bad things are. Things will get fucking tough before they get easy. But you will never know how great life can be if you don't stick with it. Reach out to people if you need to. And thanks for anyone who got through this jumbled mess of my thoughts today. Best of luck!",7

243,1izl02t,Buprenorphine withdrawal,lillesvein,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1izl02t/buprenorphine_withdrawal/,"I finally did it, i contacted my doctor 5 weeks ago and admitted my many years of abuse. Everything from oxy to tramadol to morphine, the last month before taking the step i was doing 200-300mg of oral morphine a day. After a short conversation with my doctor i was admitted to the emergency detox and put on 2,4mg Subutex. A week later i was sent to a rehab facility and did a taper going down 0,4mg every 3-5 days or so.

Fast forward to today, my last dose was 0,2 temgesic (buprenorphine) yesterday morning. Today has been livable compared to accute withdrawals from other opioids. With some muscle and joint aches, hot/cold flashes, yucky fever feeling, fatigue, headaches, stomach cramps and constant yawning. The doctor here says she's expecting the worst to be over in 2-3 days, which i find hard to believe concidering the halflife of buprenorphine. So my question is; will the withdrawals become more intense than this or will i just feel kinda shitty for a while? And is it true that i'll feel better in a couple day's and not weeks like some people say? Im hoping someone who has had a similar experience with only around a months use, with a gradual taper can share how it went. Thanks.

I’ve never had a withdrawal that hasn’t had me down for at least a few days before feeling somewhat okay. We both went to work like nothing was wrong, eating and drinking. Doing whatever we can to make sure that we don’t fall into feeling crappy. 

We’ve planned for activities both inside and outside so that we can stay distracted and won’t get bored because boredom or being stuck in your head can easily trigger a relapse. We’ve stopped taking naps so that we are tired enough by the end of the night to sleep throughout the entirety of it. Take showers to avoid RLS. And spend time in the living room with family instead of being in our room. Something needed to change, we needed to change. We were so miserable being stuck in our heads about what went wrong, seeing everyone live life. We need to do that instead of being upset that we don’t. The money used for drugs could be used to go to the movies, out to eat, skating, bowling, anything! But we spent it all on drugs and would be so sad and angry that we didn’t have money to do what other ppl our age are doing (23). No more, no more woe is me. I cannot guarantee full sobriety but I can guarantee that I’m done letting drugs dictate my life and I will do whatever I can to make sure I never fall victim to pills. I won’t let pills make me not want to go out, leave work early to go pick up, take off work because I hadn’t gotten more, make plans and not sticking with them because I was high at the time, and other bull crap. 

I will make it to every doctor, rehab, and therapy appointment. I will go out and try to make friends. I will continue to date my husband and flourish our marriage. I will work hard and earn money to help my husband financially take care of us. I will stay on my prescribed medications. I will live life and not be afraid of the world anymore. I have to. ",11

I actually did it. I chose myself and my future over temporary relief. It doesn't even feel real to me. It seems so silly but for years I've watched people's sobriety journeys with such envy & frustration because I convinced myself I couldn't do it and I would inevitably die this way, but I did it. There's no guarantee that I can keep this up forever or even for another week, but today gave me hope that I might have it in me.

Edit: I was truly not expecting so many responses dude, thank you all so so much for the nice things you guys have been saying, it means alot :) and for everyone who said they've been clean for around the same time as me, I wish you guys luck from the bottom of my heart, we can do this ❤️‍🩹",54

Wasn’t the nights I shook so bad I couldn’t hold a glass of water.
Wasn’t the cold sweats, the restless legs, or the way my brain screamed for “just one more.”

The hardest thing was facing myself when it was all gone.
No numbing. No escape hatch. Just me. Raw. Ugly. Real.

That’s when I realized recovery isn’t just about stopping. It’s about building.
Building a version of yourself that can’t be broken the same way again.
I still wake up with cravings some days. But now I fight for the life I almost threw away.

2,1lqnn9b,My wife died at 32 from CHS + overprescribed Xanax. Please hear this.,Away-Hippo-8052,147,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1lqnn9b/my_wife_died_at_32_from_chs_overprescribed_xanax/,"I just lost my wife last night.
She was 32 years old.
Beautiful. Brave. Funny as hell, smart, and my best friend. 
Four years clean from heroin. One year sober from alcohol.
Her name was Natasha.

What killed her wasn’t what most people expect.

It was CHS—Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome—made worse by Xanax, overprescribed by a doctor who should have known her history. And it all happened so quietly… until it didn’t.


What CHS Did:

She started vomiting randomly. For hours. Days sometimes.
We thought it was food poisoning. Then anxiety. Then maybe hormones.
Nobody told us weed could do this.
Nobody told us high-THC products can flip on you after years of use.
Nobody warned her that the very thing she thought was helping her… was making her sick.
The first emergency room we went to wouldn't even see us, she was scared and in pain.

What Her Doctor Did:

He prescribed her Xanax for the nausea and sleep.
Not once. Repeatedly.
Even knowing she had a past with benzos and heroin.
Even after we explained how scared we were about her slipping.

And I think…
I think while I was at work, she started using the Xanax more often. Quietly. To sleep. To rest. To escape the pain of vomiting, shaking, losing hope.
And she didn’t tell me.
Because she didn’t want to let me down.


Now I’m Driving Her Car Home. Alone.

She smiled at me the day I left.
I said, “Get better, baby cakey, so we can go on more adventures.”
She smiled and said, “We’ve got so many more to go.” 

But now she’s gone.
And I need you to understand this:

CHS is real.

Long-term weed use can hurt you.

Doctors don’t always listen.

And benzos aren’t harmless.

If you’re fighting this or someone you love is… don’t wait. Speak up. Push back. Taper. Get help. Tell someone.


I’m going to fight to hold the cannabis boards, doctors, and medical systems accountable. But for now, I just needed the world to hear her name. Natasha, please say her name out loud, please. 

She didn’t deserve this.
She deserved a future.
She deserved to be heard.

And if this post saves even one person from the same fate—then her voice still echoes.


Thanks for listening. I’m not okay. But I’m still here.

3,1hisl61,I'm officially one year clean from opiates!!!,Hatefulthrowawayacc,141,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1hisl61/im_officially_one_year_clean_from_opiates/,"Since I was 16 years old opiates have been a monumental part of my life. I started by taking my mom's old oxys that she would stash for herself. But when that dried up I moved on to Percocets that I would get from my friends at school. The next two years spiraled into a never-ending cat-and-mouse game of me trying to hide my use from the people in my life. I went as far as to intentionally isolate myself from my family and my friends just so I could be alone and nod out for a little while longer. Sadly this habit was never discovered by my parents or any significant figure. I remember this time in my life vividly, and with that, I remember my attitude towards my addiction. The intense denial I was in still makes me say out loud ""What the fuck was I thinking"".

 And then one day in November of 2023 I od'd for the first time. I'll never forget the fear I felt when I found out what happened, in that moment I don't think I couldve spoken if I wanted to, all I could do was cry and hold myself. That was the very first moment I accepted what was wrong with me. I spent the better part of December 2023 detoxing and let me tell you, it was a new circle of hell. I remember thinking to myself that this was worse than active addiction, I could feel every part of my body heating up like I was in the hottest sauna of my life but simultaneously I was shivering and felt an instinctive need to get warm, for lack of a better term it felt like hell froze over. 

That's not me saying the next 11 months were any easier, it wasn't. Every little thing made me think of percs I remember sitting in class and feeling this overpowering urge to get high again. I felt so bad, it felt like every part of my body was tingling with an intense mental and physical pain, a pain that would only be relieved if I just picked up my phone and called my plug. But by some stroke of luck or maybe divine intervention (If you're big into religion) I stayed clean.

 And now here I am, 19 years old and officially one year clean off opiates. I still get those urges from time to time especially if I am bored at the house with nothing to do and I've accepted that this will be a factor that I will deal with for the rest of my life and I'm ok with it, but as I've gone longer and longer without using I've found more and more ways to mentally tell myself NO! Nobody in my life that is significant like my mom or my friends knows this fact about me so I figured this is the best place to share! I still smoke weed, drink and every once in a while I'll do psychedelics with my friends but I made this promise to myself: I will never use opiates for recreational use ever again! And I will do everything in my power to keep that promise no matter what happens.",37

It started with pills in college, Percs and Xanax at first. Then came heroin. Then crack. Then fentanyl. Then tranq. He’s overdosed at least six times (that we know of). I’ve gotten the calls, the kind that freeze your blood, and somehow, by the grace of God and some incredible doctors and nurses, he survived every one.

For a long time, I didn’t think he’d make it to 30. I’ve seen him steal, lie, disappear, and come back a shell of himself. And yet, he’s still here. Still breathing. Still trying.

And just last month, he became a father.

He still struggles. He’s not “fixed.” But something in him shifted when that baby was born. I saw it in his eyes, like maybe, just maybe, there’s still something worth fighting for.

I wanted to share this not because it’s a perfect ending, it’s not. But because sometimes we need reminders that it’s never too late to turn a new leaf. That the same person who’s burned every bridge can still build something new.

If you pray, I’d ask you to say one for him and his daughter. And if you’re still in the middle of it, still lost in the cycle, please know there’s still hope.

Even now. Especially now.

5,1pjd73e,"I'm trying to advocate for people in opiate withdrawal, because nobody should have to hang themselves to find an end to the pain.",Overall-Project-5910,102,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1pjd73e/im_trying_to_advocate_for_people_in_opiate/,"Emergency Access to Withdrawal Relief

Opioid withdrawal is not “just the flu.” People who haven’t lived it think it’s about some body aches or nausea, something you can grit your teeth through. But the reality is far more brutal. Withdrawal can feel like being trapped inside your own body while every nerve screams. It is panic, desperation, crawling-out-of-your-skin agony, and for many, a psychological torment that pushes them toward unsafe choices or even suicide. People hang themselves or overdose during withdrawal—not because they are weak, but because the suffering is indescribable.

Right now, in the United States, people in acute opioid withdrawal have almost no rapid, legal, humane way to get relief. Emergency rooms often send patients away with nothing. “Comfort meds” can only do so much. Methadone clinics require long lines, paperwork, intake processes, urine tests, and strict schedules—things a person in severe withdrawal cannot realistically navigate. Buprenorphine can be life-saving, but access is still too limited, too slow, and too dependent on finding the right provider at the right moment.

When someone is in crisis, time is everything.

We need a fast, legal, medically supervised alternative—something people can access immediately to stabilize themselves until they can enter a longer-term program. The system treats withdrawal as a moral issue instead of a medical emergency, and people are dying because of it.

Imagine if we treated heart attacks or asthma attacks the way we treat withdrawal:
“Sorry, come back at 4 AM for intake.”
“Try again when we have time.”
“You’ll just have to suffer through it.”

This is unacceptable.

People in withdrawal deserve:

Emergency access to safe, fast-acting medication that prevents crisis, self-harm, overdose, or relapse.

A walk-in, no-barrier stabilization option—just like urgent care—staffed with medical professionals trained in addiction medicine.

Policies that acknowledge withdrawal as a true emergency, not a moral failure.

Legal and accessible medications that offer immediate relief while someone waits for a full treatment intake.


We already do this for countless other medical conditions. Why not for opioid withdrawal, where the stakes are literally life and death?

If we want to save lives, reduce suffering, and give people a real chance to recover, we must treat withdrawal with the urgency and dignity it deserves. No more turning people away. No more making them wait hours or days while their bodies and minds are on fire. No more preventable deaths.

People deserve compassion.
People deserve relief.
People deserve a system that doesn’t make them beg for help while they’re fighting for their lives.",61

A feeling of deep, unadulterated fear hits me like a semi fueled with meth. Fuck! Dude im going to narcan you bro wake the fuck up!! I look for the narcan. Where the fuck!@@@ is the narcan!!!im hyperventilating. In my mind its to late to call 911 its been about 3 minutes. THINK! The car! The narcan is 3 stories down in the hotel parking lot. That might as well be in fucking bangcock. I feel the feeling of death creep into my psyche. This cannot be happening. I think of the phone call to my mom i will have to make.   Everything looked like it was melting. My world was melting. I wish i was never born.

I grab my 2009 satur vue keys and bust through the door then my stomach drops as i almost let the door close without having the room key. That would be instant death for my brother and probably suicide for me if that door closed. I take my shoes and wedge them so it doesnt shut and i fucking run. It was the longest run ill ever have to run. Each step a eternity. Dread filled my nostrils as tears jetted down my sunken face. Run faster you fuck!  I see my dented saturn. I tear apart the dash and grab the narcan. Its august and its hot and its probably 2am and my brother is in our hotel room dying. Ill never talk to him again i thought to myself as i run back through hell. I will never forget the hallway from the stairs to the room. Never-ending regret. I have never felt so helpess and alone. If hell had a feeling. This was it

I ram through the door like a skinny minature tweaker kool aid man. Hes in the same locked up rigamortis position. I get him flat on his back and i pop the narcan and stick it up his stupid nose. I slap him a few times and immediatly start cpr. Fuuuuck austin please dont do this. Please dont leave me here alone on this weird fucked up planet!!! Im crying as i give cpr. I look at his pale blue face and i slap it hard as i can i punch him in the stomach angry and hoping it will trigger something and he wont die. I try dragging him to the shower but alas im not strong enough im screaming for help. It feels like this is a  cruel joke. Where the fuck are you ashton!!@ i continue cpr for probably 10 minutes. I taste blood,our teeth have been colliding and made me bleed. I can taste the taco bell we ate about a hour earlier. Fuck i miss that time era. Right now i would do anything to switch spots with my brother. My little brother is dying. Im giving cpr to my little brother. God please help me. Please dont let him die.  I promise ill be a better bigger brother. Ill get sober and serve you. Please i cant handle this !!@..

Im giving chest compressions, then lift his head up, hoping to open airways. Then the best sound I’ve ever heard graced my ears. Like a hoover vacuum, he took a deep inhale and started choking. I collapse against the wall and look at him while he takes in his surroundings.  “What happened fuck did i overdose?” He says angerly. I nod. He comes over and lifts me up and says ” im so sorry dude i didnt mean to put you through that. Thank you for saving my life” while he hugs me. A wave of relief washes over my body. Over the next hour i almost overdose i was told. I smoked a bunch of fetty trying to get the feelings out of my head. It was two more months of hardcore drug use and debauchery for us to finally go to rehab again. Sorry lord.",30
7,1k3nnbh,Flushed down the toilet..,DripPureLSDonMyCock,96,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1k3nnbh/flushed_down_the_toilet/,"Hey I just wanted to share a success moment. I was looking for something last night in my attic and I came across a bunch of empty sub wrappers. My inner junkie said ""look in them, maybe you left a piece in it!"" I looked and saw there was a half in one. I instantly had a moment of clarity and thought ""dude you're fucking clean now, don't you want to stay that way?? You went through everything to be here right now .. flush it."" I walked downstairs and flushed it. The symbolic part of it was I took a shit earlier and thought I flushed but it didn't actually go down so I dropped the piece in a pile of shit then flushed. Obviously subs played an important role in being sober today but going back out of nowhere to get high is shit. Fuck that. 

I was really proud of myself because situations like that in the past were always my downfall. The lesson learned is to immediately flush it. My first reaction was I put it in the trash and kept looking for something...junkie translation: I'll be back for you later. Have a good one y'all.",27

And if you’re sober, you should too.",problyurdad_,98,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1j2km2o/ive_accepted_it_and_if_youre_sober_you_should_too/,"Maybe this will help someone some day. A perspective that has recently came to vision for me and it put a nail in the coffin that is my addiction.       
       
Hi everybody, I’m Problyurdad_, and I’m a heroin addict. I’m going to be 42 years old this year. I first dabbled with heroin back in 2008, the same way many of you did - I got injured at work a few years prior, and was sent home with what should’ve been a ten year supply of opiate pain meds that I burned through in about 4 days (hyperbolic relief, it’s okay to laugh) and turned to the streets when my doctor wouldn’t supply me any more pills, because I wasn’t doing the physical therapy because physical therapy made me feel better and I didn’t want to feel better I wanted pills.            
        
Back then, fentanyl was just starting to rain on heroins parade. Most of the dope we could get our hands on smelled strongly of vinegar, it was light brown, and it made you feel like you were warm and cozy wrapped up in a blanket with a smile on your face. It made you feel good!  It didn’t make you itch. It didn’t make your eyes and nose run. It didn’t give you rosacea. Most of all, it didn’t make you a raging psychopath with wildly unpredictable behavior that you couldn’t remember or control.             
        
In fact, all it ever did was make the day better. I could work harder, faster, longer, and I (thought) I found a drug that finally made me feel great again. Normal, so it seemed. Until the fentanyl started creeping in.       
       
And now, in hindsight, I’m glad it did. Because when I was on heroin cut with fentanyl, I was a much different person. People could tell. I could no longer hide my habit. My behavior was too outlandish. For example, one of my best friends stayed over one night after a concert. He slept on the couch. Before bed I went to the bathroom to shoot up. That’s all I remember. But according to him, I wrapped toilet paper around myself and came back out to the living room and brought it to him as a present. He had to guide me back to my bed. I woke up around 4 am and he wasn’t on the couch and I didn’t know why. He had left after that because he didn’t want to be around it. I don’t blame him.          
          
I went rehab later that summer (2019) and had 5 years of sobriety under my belt before I got the itch to dabble again. And dabble I did, and once again my behavior immediately gave me away. I did things I can’t even tell you because I don’t remember. But my kids saw, my wife saw, and that was the end of that. I dabbled for about a week and then checked right back in to the hospital, never to look back again. Because now I know, and now I am 100% aware, that whatever it is I am looking for from heroin is long gone. Those days are over, and I can’t even get my hands on what I would traditionally say is my drug of choice, the experience I’m seeking, the feelings I’m trying to feel….         
        
If you’re thinking about using again, don’t. Whatever it is you’re looking for isn’t there anymore. The experience you want is long gone. You’re not going to be able to hide it, and it’s not going to be what you have in your head as an idea for it anyways. It’ll be way different and the only thing you’ll gain from it is experience, and another time you wish you hadn’t picked it back up again. Trust me. I know. ",25

I was about 96 hours sober from heroin. I was actually feeling pretty good besides the back pain. No other symptoms other than back pain. I made a post in here about having back pain and someone recommended 7-oh, so I got a pack of pills. 


I took one last night and I felt fucking fantastic, pure bliss. I took another this morning and felt great..it last about 4 hours. It worked great... Too great, but when I woke up I realized I woke up sicker with withdrawal symptoms that I thought had went away. 

Did deeper research this morning and come to find out, it doesn't just work like an opioid, IT IS AN OPIOID. No different than heroin, percs, morphine, etc. so after it wore off I felt more dope sick than before. So not only is it an opioid, it's 22x stronger than morphine and 4x stronger than heroin. It literally took me back to day 1 of my detox, except the withdrawals were way worse than before. 

Update: I got a bag of H last night. But I don't consider it a relapse... More like a reset. Give those stupid pills enough time to get out my system, just a week, and then stop again. I can handle heroin withdrawals anytime, but the withdrawal I felt from those 7oh pills were just completely unbearable. I couldn't function at all. 


So just putting this here to warn others. Don't take it unless you've completely detoxed from your DOC.

I was recently banned from the subreddit for brining up the fact that it has a lot of religious reference and mention of god, as well as congratulating someone who posted about being clean from hard drugs while still smoking weed and sharing my own situation.

The moderation team made it explicitly clear that it is not a place for questioning their own narrative and have no qualms about silencing someone who goes against their own status quo.

I was told that, as a member of NA for 10+ years and someone who was born and raised within the rooms that I was not welcome there.

I mentioned how their ban actually violated their own rules and they proceeded to mute me.

I’m sharing this as a warning because all it takes is one power tripping mod to shun away a struggling person and they could end up triggering a relapse causing someone to overdose.

Man that was a solid 2 weeks a real shake rattle and roll followed by another 2 months of just generally feeling shitty but still I was excited. I spent my entire adult life a lying piece of shit junkie so at 31 I was completely unsure of where to start or what to do except stay off dope.

I would argue that the process itself—the act of contacting a dealer, meeting them at a designated location, acquiring the drugs, and returning home—can be just as addictive. There is something inherently thrilling to the human brain in engaging in activities we know are illegal, yet manage to execute without detection, evading the government’s reach. This illicitness creates a sense of euphoria in itself.

I have heard of countries such as Portugal and cities like Amsterdam, where drug use has been decriminalized, and interestingly, abuse rates are lower compared to when substances were criminalized. The thrill that comes with the illegality of the act seems to be a significant factor in the addiction; when drugs are legalized, that thrill diminishes, making the substance itself less enticing. Additionally, there is a certain euphoria associated with the ability to acquire what one desires when so many are disconnected from access, unable to obtain what they need when they need it.",63

As I was driving home today after the New Years Eve fireworks, and the amazing year I just had. (Got engaged, amazing year in my business, bought a house, financial goals ect...) I couldn't help but think about the days where I used to wake up, get my fix and then cry in my car before work, feeling like I will never escape the hole I had dug myself.

The last 6 years after getting clean have absolutely flown by, and has helped shape the person I am becoming. Life definitely has its ups and downs, but what a journey.

Getting clean and staying clean unlocks a superpower. I can attribute a lot of my success to the failures I learnt through recovery.

I remember reading posts on this sub when I was in the first weeks of recovery, posts like this seemed impossible. It's not. Life is beautiful. 

Happy New Year.",26

Going into Christmas with all my shopping done already, the gifts for my daughter and extended family already wrapped, and ready to host my girls family on Christmas Eve feels great.

I'm able to be responsible, which feels better than any drug ever did. Seven years ago on Christmas I was in detox for a polydrug IV habit and ready to ice myself. For anyone who is struggling and doesn't see a light at the end of the tunnel, i can tell you that it is there",11

I overdosed. I’ve only been using a few months, only using dillies. I picked up a bad batch yesterday unknowingly, didn’t get my shit tested. I went down hard. Luckily there were people around that noticed. I stopped breathing for 10 minutes, went completely purple. They did CPR and narcaned me 5 times before I woke up. I woke up incredibly confused and upset. Got taken to the hospital via ambulance, threw up everything in my stomach. 

I’m alive. And I’m so fucking grateful to have woken up this morning. I’m hoping there are no long-term consequences to my brain after being out for 10 minutes. This sounds silly but I always thought it would never happen to *me*. That it was just something that happened to hardcore users.

In the ambulance on the way to the hospital, I took out the rest of my supply and gave it to the paramedics, and I said, I’m done. I can’t do this anymore. I’ve been hiding this secret for months, it’s so exhausting. I was so close to dying yesterday, and I’m only 24. I deserve to live a long, healthy life. So I’m done. Today is day one of sobriety.

It’s been a long journey. Using for years, hitting my rock bottom, then somehow finding the light at the end of the tunnel to make the leap towards recovery. My life has done a complete 180 in this past year. I’m officially going back to school to get my bachelors degree so I can become a drug addiction counselor to turn a dark chapter in my life into something positive. My depression, anxiety, and agoraphobia have improved so much. I’m in my first healthy relationship and today marks six months. I’m waiting to hear back from a job I applied for and from the last two interviews it seems promising. 
I would have never been able to achieve these things while I was using. If anyone out there is struggling with addiction just know there’s always hope. I truly thought I was a lost cause and now I feel like a whole different person. Never give up. 💖",25

It wasn’t easy, it wasn’t cheap and it wasn’t traditional getting here, but life on the other side is worth it.

I want to let you know you can do this! There is hope and life without pain killers is beautiful, not boring. If you are a wife or if you have a spouse struggling, know you are not alone. 

Today I started a new community or “sub” to spread awareness and stories on quitting. It’s for addicts of all kind. If you could join that would be awesome. I want to use it as sort of a diary for us all. 

I want to edit this post to end some confusion, he is NOT on Kratom either. He is clean from both. Kratom ended up being worse than the opiate addiction itself. If you are thinking of ending your opiate addiction with Kratom, do yourself a favor and stay away! You do not want to be in that hole.

Get your ass into the clinic and start dosing and get your life back. Suboxone is a great medication for people addicted to opiates that AREN'T Fentanyl because Fent gets stored in your fat and therefore is sending people into PWD who have waited 4-5 days. It's not worth the gamble when Methadone is a full agonist and therefore doesn't cause this issue. I will say that it sucks pecker having to drive to the clinic every day in the beginning while you establish trust and hand in enough clean drug tests to get take homes. If you have been going for long enough and haven't failed any drug screens (minus weed) you will get take homes. Call u your local clinic and see if they take insurance AND if they do and you don't have any, your counselor should be able to give you some resources :)",90
27,1hwv1f7,"Threw almost four years clean down the drain. Put some sense into my fucking head

",Ok_Intention6827,64,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1hwv1f7/threw_almost_four_years_clean_down_the_drain_put/,"Back in 2020, I went to rehab after a year long OC80 habit. At the end I ate three to four of those blue fuckers a day, it was terrible. I did the whole nine yards: got clean, moved cities, went to university, got a prestigious internship and finished my bachelors thesis with highest grades. All great, everybody so proud, but all along I was feeling like shit. I was young when I went to rehab, and I was in such a rush to get out in the world and prove everybody wrong that I didn't gave two fucks about what caused my addictive behaviour.

Some months back, in June, I started taking benzodiazepines, I guess it was for anxiety symptoms. i never did it to get high, only in normal doses per se. Don't think I've ever taken over 40mg diazepam over 24 hrs. I made a deal with myself: hand in your bachelor thesis in December, then seek help. And that's what I did. I'm in the midst of a taper with my local addiction center, and on that front it's great something is being done. They might even offer me some therapy.

A few weeks back, although, life took unexpected turns. I was crushed, emotionally and financially. I bought an OC80, did 40mg, saved 40mg for the day after and nodded the fuck out for two days. The warm blanket felt exactly the way I remembered it. I know why I did it, but I regret it just as much as taking that first benzo back in June.

It was in the mid of December, today is January 8th, and I just did it for I think the tenth time or something like that. The 20mg don't get me nodding anymore, 40mg barely does. I can go two to three days, sensing no withdrawals, but then I do them again. As mentioned, this has been going on for some weeks.

I went to this sub for so much advice, support and comfort back in 2020 and 2021 when I was in active addiction and in my recovery phase. Now I'm on the steps of a nasty oxy habit again. Apparently, I can't get into my head what it is I'm doing. I did around 50mg tonight, and I plan of doing the rest. It will be the last pill, but I said that the last time and the last time again.

This may sound so fucking dumb, but please, someone, remind me why we don't do this shit. Remind me why this is the direct pathway to misery. Remind that I'm better than this. Remind me there's still a turning point without going through the whole nine yards again. I'm not sure I can do that.

28,1klt4qp,I FOUND a legitimate malindkroft fentanyl hcl patch while walking to the grocery store today.,insyzygy322,65,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1klt4qp/i_found_a_legitimate_malindkroft_fentanyl_hcl/,"Just last week I was thinking about how im now far enough away from my last sublocade injection that I could probably break through it with fent. 

However, I've never done street fent, and never plan on it. I was a pharma opi to real heroin addict, through and through. 

With that being said, I used to smoke gel fent patches back in the day. Wasn't my fav, but it when it was available, I used it. 

Hadn't thought about fent patches in a very long time.. until last week.. when I had this thought 'hey, you don't fuck with street 'fent', and that's good.. but imagine if it was the year 200x and you had access to fent patches. Wouldn't that be cooooool?'

The absolute shock when I reached down at the end of my block and picked up a sealed malindkroft 25 mcg/hr patch.. MAN. 

It felt trippy. Like, the universe whispering in my ear.

""Here, want to try? Try.""

Not even a fucking ounce of desire once it was in my hand. 

Immediately walked down to the encampment down the block and gave it away.. couldn't exactly bring myself to destroy it. Technically harm reduction for someone smoking street fent lol

What a trip. Hadn't seen one of those in over a decade. Never thought I'd see them again. 

Feels liberating, in a way. I don't even regret it now that I've calmed down. I've had some past experiences where I ditch a substance in these sorts of scenarios and regret it deeply like 10 mins later. 

Truly a trip

Edit:

Thanks so much for the love, everybody! I have a tendency to invalidate myself, and really didn't even see it as an 'accomplishment' of any sort until y'all convinced me it was. 

Something inside of me fights me hard when I attempt to be proud of myself, but I'll keep doing my best to recognize that my actions were a manifestation of years and years of hard work. I didn't just 'not have desire to use it'. 

Much love 🫶 ",30

31,1libd6j,Opiate withdrawal,Economy_Succotash751,56,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1libd6j/opiate_withdrawal/,"I asked chatgpt to write a description of what withdrawals felt like. It understood the assignment...

Opiate withdrawal is a deeply physical and emotional ordeal — a storm that tears through the body and mind with brutal clarity. It often begins like the onset of a severe flu, but it quickly escalates into something more punishing and unrelenting.

In the beginning, there's a creeping unease, a gnawing sense that something is wrong. The body feels tense, wired with nervous energy. Anxiety starts to rise, like a drumbeat in the chest, accompanied by yawning, watery eyes, and a runny nose. These may seem minor at first, but they signal the opening notes of the full symphony of suffering to come.

As hours pass, restlessness sets in. Muscles ache, deep in the bones — not like soreness from overuse, but a crawling, burning tightness that won’t be soothed. The skin feels too tight and too sensitive all at once. People often describe it as feeling like ants are crawling beneath their skin, or like their body is trying to tear itself out from the inside.

The gastrointestinal system turns traitor. Nausea churns in the stomach. Cramps twist the gut with merciless precision. Diarrhea becomes relentless. Appetite vanishes. Vomiting may begin. It feels as though the body is purging itself, desperate to rid itself of toxins, but in doing so, it strips away comfort, control, and dignity.

Sleep becomes impossible. The body is exhausted but won’t rest. Every attempt to lie still is disrupted by chills that shake the spine, followed by waves of sweating that leave the sheets drenched. Legs twitch uncontrollably — restless leg syndrome becomes maddening. It's like trying to sleep while being electrocuted from the inside out.

Psychological distress builds alongside the physical. Anxiety intensifies into panic. Depression creeps in like a heavy fog. Thoughts become chaotic, dark, and hopeless. Cravings claw at the brain, screaming for relief, for the drug that could silence this pain. There's a profound sense of despair — not just over the withdrawal, but over the realization of how tightly the drug has coiled itself around every system in the body.

Time distorts. Hours feel like days. Every second is felt acutely. There's no distraction strong enough to cut through the agony. Some people cry. Some rage. Some stare blankly, barely able to speak.

Eventually, the storm begins to ease — but the emotional weight may linger long after the physical symptoms subside. Guilt, shame, fear of relapse, and a shattered sense of self often remain. Even in the calm, the memory of withdrawal haunts like a ghost.

Opiate withdrawal isn’t just discomfort. It’s a full-body rebellion, a psychological unraveling — and for many, a terrifying glimpse into how powerfully these substances have taken hold. But with support, safety, and care, recovery is possible. Even from this.

I remember him opening it and seeing all these written messages inside and I think it mighta been the first time I had even seen a yearbook.  All the messages said things like What's up Ganja _____ STAY HIGH my brother, your best friend.  Or ""I'll never forget the first time tripping with you"" or ""Signed, the ______ bar boyzzz"" CHEERS!  My brother was laughing n so excited reading it like HOLY SHIT I can't believe this is dad's!  We grew up hearing about the trippy 60s, the art, how drugs were such an influential part of that era.  

Growing up, it seemed like any movie kids wanted to see in the 90s- and did - romanticized tf outta drugs.  Every time someone smoked, popped a pill, hit a vein, the cinematics would intensify n it'd usually be attached to something very emotional or powerful in the movie.  Almost every kid I knew, I'd heard say, ""I'd try that once if I could"".  Well, I was raised very strict and though my parents drank at parties, I never saw any drugs at the parties.  By the time I was 12, I was smoking cigarettes, as were most of my friends (strangely, it was kinda normal for kids to go through adults coats for cigs at a party even at that age, we'd try to hide it but it was almost like ""looks like the kids found some cigarettes they're smoking out there"").  Even into the 2000s some movies, especially about teens, the whole basis of the movie would be how they were getting x, y, z for a party or for whatever.  Soon after, I tried weed.  Then I got my first bf who was a huge drinker n he was older.  I began drinking daily.  

The house in my neighborhood that we used to chill at was full of teens n young 20s in n out non stop, all my friends, all way older than me.  The dude who lived there's mom was almost never there n when she did get there she did crack in her room n didn't seem to notice or care that her son had turned her house into the equivalent of an illegal drug den, I mean, we graffitid artwork all over her fkn walls...  When she was friendly which was rare, it was usually cuz we were holding something she wanted.

My freshmen year in HS was absolute hell.  I was finally out from under my parents very tight watch and I just remember being angry all the time at every fkn adult that had something to say to me in that building.  Almost daily the deans would pull me in the office, go thru my backpack, steal all my sharpies n paint markers n spray paint.  Graffiti was a huge part of my life at the time and I was the only girl I knew who went bombing n they just kept taking all my shit. I remember how I felt when he'd open my new pack of Newports and break them all in front of me over the garbage while barking at me and I was INFURIATED.  I'd walk out every time, meet up w my bf n start drinking.  They kept kicking me out of every hs I went to cuz I never went.  I was now at that drug house drinking from 7am to midnight every day.  Doing every drug that came through.  Never went to Sophomore year, just dropped out n kept going to that house every day.  It was only a few blocks from where I lived.

Then my bf went on vacation with his family but I kept going there cuz all my ""friends"" were there.  They had been scheming and I had noooooo fkn clue, what a stupid little girl.  The first day my bf was gone I remember this tall guy who was half black half Italian n had always seemed like one of the more normal dudes who'd only come thru once in a while....he was walkin towards the house w a huge bottle of vodka and I was sitting on the porch w my 22oz Heineken.  He said wow!  Thank God you're here, I got this for you!  Which was suspicious at first n I was like why?  And he said remember that night last week?  You gave me so many of your Heinekens and cigs so I got you this to repay you.  I figured he just stole it for me n I was like alright cool thx.  He said, I'll brb I'm just gonna run in n make myself a quick drink, I gotta go, you can have the rest.  

I don't know what happened after that first sip but I woke up and I couldn't move.  I opened my eyes and I was in a house I'd never been in before laying on someone's couch and the room was full of men, wall to wall.  I was naked.  They put a dropper in my mouth n I went black again.  I was kidnapped, raped repeatedly.  Somehow didn't end up pregnant or sick with anything.  It was the biggest secret in the neighborhood and every guy knew, soon their gfs were finding out ""I had fkd their man"".  I got into so many fkn fights, couldn't go anywhere in my neighborhood, fought nearly every girl I ever knew.  But I was too something ... scared..  proud... fkd in the head to tell anyone what really happened those 3 days.

That was the breaking point I think.  I was determined to be as numb as possible at all times cuz I had nobody to talk to about this, I didn't know what to do.  And, tbh I felt like a pos, like trash, disposable, to be used n discarded.  Around that time I just started going to bars and clubs every night.  Made new friends, got more fucked up, bounced all over NYC til 4 am every morning.  I had fun, so many good times, but plenty of pretty bad ones too.  Then, sometime while I was still doing what I was doing I got into a really bad car accident.  My doctor prescribed me Oxy 30s 3x a day.  I finally found my FAVORITE drug.  Kept running out he kept giving more, more, more.  Until one day I show up and he says I'm sorry, I can still give you the spinal shots but the meds you were on I can only give to cancer patients now.  I was pretty angry about it tbh cuz these pills on the street weren't cheap n I had a HABIT and a fkn half.  I decided whatever I'll just get them if I see someone has em, guess I can't have em every day anymore.  I was at a friend's house when all the sudden I thought I was dying, I panicked and told my friends something was wrong.  They were asking a million questions and I remember mumbling something about stopping the pills n maybe that's why and one guy was like OXY?  YOU'RE IN WITHDRAWAL!  YOU COULD FKN DIE!  YOUR DR DIDN'T GIVE YOU ANYTHING?  SUBOXONE?  I didn't even know what a suboxone was bro I was so like, uninformed about this shit.  I just knew I was gonna die that night and I layed down.  Not even 5 mins later the same guy comes in the bedroom n he's like you sniff coke?  And I'm like yeah u got?  He's like no, sniff this n you'll feel better.  That's ALLLLLL I had to hear I didn't care if it was rat poison just make me feel like I'm NOT dying PLEASE.  It was heroin.

So, I replaced the pills with sniffing heroin.  All I knew in my empty stupid head was keep doing this at all costs, you won't die.  I became his dealer's top custy.  For years I always kept a tight circle of dope friends.  I had met a girl who I got along with for once.  We became best buddies, basically did everything together, tried to quit together at a Methadone clinic, kept using.  By that time I was using needles.  We both got to a point that it was getting really hard to find a vein that worked anymore.  She got a bad infection in her right arm and it was bad enough she was hardly able to move her arm.  I kept telling her she had to get it seen cuz it looked really bad but since it was always covered I'd forget about it then realize again and ask if she went to the dr yet and I really don't know why she wouldn't just go to the hospital n let them patch it up, fix it, whatever had to be done.  But we were on a constant chase for dope and it just took a backseat, one day right as I dropped her off in front of her house, she said something to me, that for the first time ever, since I knew her, made me mad and not just mad, but I peeled out off her block as she was holding her stomach.  3 hrs later she texted ""I'm in the hospital call me plz"" and I guess I assumed she was at the ER for her arm but I remember just throwing my phone back on my bed like fk u bitch I've been saying let's go for months now you decided to go the day you pissed me tf off?  Get fkd 🖕

She was dead by the morning.  Sepsis.  I lost my fkn mind.  The guilt.  The only female friend I ever cared about is dead and it's my fault.  I was so consumed with my bs that I didn't just make the appointment for her like a good friend n take her.  And my last words to her before she died was ""good, u dumb bitch, keep letting him rob u then, I'm not saving you next time your shit is gone"".  

She had no family at all but one sister who had written her off eons ago.  I called n told her that her sister had died and she said good and hung up.  She had absolutely nothing, nobody, that cared but me.  I was her emergency contact in the hospital.  I did the best I could with what I could, paid for everything I had to, got her ashes.  I couldn't stop crying for weeks, so many regrets, so much pain, there wasn't any amount of now, fent - that would stop my eyes from puddling up constantly.  I sat in my childhood bedroom again, a total mess.  Surrounded by ashtrays, bottles, needles, stamp bags all around me.  I stayed in bed killing myself slowly, and paying a high price to do it.  In my head for some reason I was thinking I had only been doing dope for 10 yrs.  I stayed alone for 3 yrs for the most part, couldn't enjoy partying anymore.  Every day I hoped I'd get a bag they measured wrong or something and I could just be at peace.

Then one day I got a phone call from this really cool kid I had met at rehab once.  He was the only one not trying to get in my pants and we had a great time in rehab together, so I picked up.  He said hey and asked how I was n he told me he was 5 yrs clean.  He was off the streets and in college.  It didn't even sound anything like the guy I remembered.  He was in the rooms, doing the work and doing a good job.  He kept begging me to make a meeting n I was stubborn.  But I finally decided after the new year I'd get clean.  He kept checking in on me n it helped me stick to my plan.  So I went for it when the time came.  I was so tired of feeling sad, so tired of paying to kill myself slowly.  I didn't have the balls to jump off my roof.  I had already tried.

I knew I didn't wanna be back in that methadone clinic w all the dope dealers outside n everyone still using and I had read about the Bernese method and just said, it's time.  I was pasted to my bed for 9 days, truly thought I might die but I didn't even care, I was NEVER touching that garbage again, no matter what it took.  I feel like all I kept saying to myself was ""tomorrow it'll be 5% better"".  I must have said it a thousand times and I finally fell asleep that 9th night.  I woke up and I could sit.  It was over.  I smiled so big and looked up, and thanked my friend.  I love you so much. I'm so sorry I didn't do the right thing. Thank you, God, I love you.  I cried tears of pure joy for the first time in my life.  It was so powerful, the only thing I could imagine could be like what I was feeling was giving birth.  I was SO HAPPY.  SO HOPEFUL.  I don't think I had ever felt real hope before that.  

Today is my 36th day off fent, subs, and every other pos garbage I can think of.  Thanks for reading, if anyone bothers to.  

You'll never be able to succeed until you're ready...it's true.  Until you've really just become so disgusted with yourself and your life that you can push through it.  My best friend died in '22 and it's '25.  Once I got clean I realized I had been on dope not for 10 yrs, but 22.  Please, look for a sign, look for hope.  Go to a meeting.  This has changed my life in such an enormous way.  All I ever remember knowing my entire life was pain.  I can finally feel again.  When I talk to my nephews, I can feel their joy and it makes my heart smile.  I promise you.  It's better on this side.

I still drive by that drug house multiple times a week.  Neighborhoods change, people change, even the house looks a bit spruced up and every time I see that family on the porch or going into the house, I thank God that they have no idea how much young laughter happened in that house as we all were killing ourselves.  My biggest regret is that my friend, my best friend that I ever had, had to die before seeing that life could be beautiful.  All we needed to do was stop looking for it in the wrong place.  I love each and every one of you and there's a place for you here, right next to me.  I'm not scared, I'm not sad, I'm actually at peace and I promise, you can be too.",16
33,1j0s1k1,Why methadone is so strictly regulated in the US,Low_Music_9744,54,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1j0s1k1/why_methadone_is_so_strictly_regulated_in_the_us/,"
I just started going to my local methadone clinic, and I find it extremely idiotic that they require you to go every single fucking day for years. And it's not just the issue of going but also waiting 1 to 3 hours each day (at least in my area). This is completely absurd—I don't know how anyone would be able to hold a job while having to attend the BS clinic every day. I can only conclude that the U.S. doesn't actually want to stop this ""opioid epidemic"" and that these centers are just there to make a profit, not to help.

For context, in my home country (Colombia), you only need to see a primary physician, usually a toxicologist, who will prescribe a month's supply of methadone that you just need to pick up at your local pharmacy. And this is the way it’s done in a lot of other countries. Mind you, Colombia is supposedly ""third world,"" and even so, paying for both the physician and the medication will only run you about $100 per month.

With all this in mind, I ask: Are there any plans to update these outdated and backward-ass regulations in the U.S. regarding methadone? Are these regulations coming from the government, or are they up to the methadone clinics’ discretion? Is anyone doing anything about this? And if not what would you recommend me to do, because I definately do not intent to keep wasting 2 hours each day (more than I wait on my dealer) and spending nearly as much as I did in dope.

This has been the toughest war with my own mind I’ve experienced yet. Doing this all on my own without any outside support from anyone at all has been a significant challenge.

The only really good news is that I no longer feel sick. The bad news is that dealing with the post acute symptoms is harder than the initial 2 week sickness. I have terribly low energy & lack the motivation to really do anything at all. I’m also trying to be comfortable with being more bored than I’ve ever been. Yet everyday I sit here and daydream about rebuilding my life, meeting new people and building new connections, but I lack the get up and go to even start. 

I know that asking how long this will persist is like asking how long is a piece of string, but I’m just so desperate for the old me to return, the energetic, outgoing, sociable & hard working me. I went from a guy who never took a day off to struggling to even maintain hygiene. I’m positive hormones are contributing to this, probably low testosterone. If so, would a doctor prescribe it to me, or just tell me to wait for it to return to base level naturally? 

Anyway, the 24 days closing on a month is somewhat of an achievement I guess. But more importantly I’m desperate to not waste any more time after three years of isolation so any advice on what I should expect for the near future regarding low energy & low mood in general would be much appreciated. 

Summer is coming up & I just want to feel somewhat normal again.

I’ve been there. I’ve sat on the edge of the bed, sweating, shaking, crying, praying for it to stop — but also praying I don’t go back to using.
I’ve been that dude who thought I was too far gone.

I’ve lost people I love — one recently took their own life — and I ain’t gonna lie, it messed me up bad.

Some people won’t agree, and that’s okay.
But it keeps me alive and off the poison that once had me chained.

I still count myself clean because I don’t use to escape anymore — I use it to cope and function, not to disappear.

Getting clean ain’t about being perfect.
It’s about surviving long enough to heal.

You don’t need to have your life figured out.
You don’t need to have a degree, a job, or a support system.
You just need that one thing — the desire to stop dying and start living again.

That’s the spark.
That’s what saved me when nothing else could.

To the PhD who’s popping pills in secret, and to the kid who dropped out and is nodding off in a trap house — I see you.
You both deserve recovery.
You both deserve peace.
You both deserve to look in the mirror and not hate who you see.

Don’t let fear of withdrawals or fear of life keep you from the freedom you deserve.
Yeah, it’s gonna hurt. Yeah, it’s gonna suck.
But that pain? It’s temporary.
And on the other side of it is something you might’ve forgotten existed — hope.

You’re not weak for being scared.
You’re strong as hell for even thinking about changing.

If you’re reading this, it means you still got fight in you.
And that’s enough for today.

One day at a time.

From loved ones, from your job, from everything. Everyone is afraid of the withdrawal, I went through fent withdrawal more time than I can count and always went back to it to scratch that itch.

Spending all of that money on bunk shit most of the time, unless you are one of the rare people with a fire plug with good prices. Regardless, it’s not worth it.

I also thought about the fact that I'm clean and I'm actually capable of caring about my child more than myself. I did not pick up. I went home, took a bath, read for a while, and went to sleep. I have NEVER in 15 years of addiction stopped myself in the middle of a deal I've already started. Usually, once I make that call, it's off to the races. I'm realizing that I don't actually want drugs. I just want to escape difficult emotions. I went to a meeting today as well. I'm just really proud of the strength I flexed, because it's new to me.

I've been severely addicted to both drugs. At my worst I was on 40mg Xanax per day, and I've also been addicted to IV heroin. I think opioid withdrawals are worse because of how many debilitating symptoms there are. 

With benzo withdrawal, the only symptoms I'd experience were anxiety, paranoia, insomnia, depression, and sometimes migraines. I know that sounds like a lot, and don't get me wrong, this all was terrible and could sometimes make me feel crazy, but that was pretty much it. All the symptoms seemed to stem from anxiety. I never had vivid hallucinations, never had a seizure (was on anti-seizure meds), and even at my worst I could still function 1 day completely off benzos if I replaced them with soma or pregabalin. 

Whereas with opioid withdrawal, there's so many symptoms that drive me nuts. The yawns, sweats, flu-like symptoms, RLS, anxiety, depression, diarrhea, puking, insomnia, fatigue, and the CRAVINGS. I'd get decent cravings when going through benzo withdrawals, but they were pretty easily alleviated if I just used soma or pregabalin. Whereas there's nothing that can really subside the cravings I get for opiates. It feels like nothing else matters at the time. 

I'm 9 days completely tapered off benzos for the first time in 6 years, and I have no cravings for the stuff. I rarely think about it, and when I do it's just me being happy that I don't have to use the crap anymore. ",115

Isn’t that kind of ironic? We’re all here because opiates wrecked our lives in one way or another. None of us should be casting stones. The fact that people feel the need to shut down someone’s experience just because it doesn’t line up with the “accepted” recovery path is awful.

Not everyone’s recovery looks the same. Some people thrive on MAT, others don’t. That doesn’t make their story less valid. The judgmental attitude is exactly what drives people to not post, and that’s a shame because those stories — even the messy, uncomfortable ones — are the ones that have helped me the most.

I get the mindset, I think, rip the bandaid off, suffer through it, earn your stripes. But I honestly don’t understand why you’d want to go full CT when your body and brain are already completely wrecked from opiates.

Like… you're already sleep-deprived, depressed, in pain, dopamine’s on vacation, your nervous system’s fried..Why make it harder than it already is?

I'm not talking about going on MAT or trading one thing for another. I'm just asking:
Is there any real benefit to making it as brutal as possible?
What’s the upside?

Is it about pride? Feeling “cleaner”? Punishment?
Or is it just not knowing there are other ways?

Not saying CT doesn’t work. I know it does for some.
But if you're already mentally and physically hanging by a thread… why add gasoline to the fire?

Genuinely asking out of interest.
Maybe there’s something I’m missing. Not here to argue! Just trying to understand what drives people to choose CT over other options.





Just to be clear this post wasn’t about sharing my story, I was just curious how people did it cold turkey (no MAT, no kratom, no psilocybin).

I personally used kratom, psilocybin and other natural supplements and vitamins to get off oxy, heroin and benzos, so I’m not claiming I did it without help.

I’m almost 14 months clean now and don’t use anything anymore — just smoke some weed and trip on shrooms 2–3 times a year.
Feel free to keep sharing your experiences! some of them are mind blowing!

I just want wanted to write to you all.

I am 14 years clean today. I have no one to tell, because no one in my life really knows I ever used. I did heroin for 3 years, averaged a gram and half a day, IV. This was right before fentanyl came into the scene.

I quit cold turkey one day. I laid in my mom’s bed for days, the bone pain and restless legs is what I remember most. My hair was matted by the end of it, I ended up hospitalized later in the month due to some electrolyte problems.  I never went on mat medicine.  I understand some need it, but I didn’t want to have to get off something else.

I’ve never relapsed. I left everyone I knew in that scene behind. I became friends with people who didn’t do hard drugs (I didn’t think that was possible). My life is just a life, nothing special. I never went back to college. I’m doing okay. I still have dreams that I use once or twice a year, but it’s fine.

I guess what I’m saying is, keep going if you’re struggling. My life is so much better not feeling sick every other day because the dealer is out or worrying where I’ll get my stuff from . That alone keeps me clean, that was the worst experience in my life.

It gets easier, I promise.

Love to you all.",8

I (24f) am 6 months sober after 5 years of opiate use and 4+ years of addiction prior to that. I’m so jealous of people who've built a beautiful little life for themselves with friends they love and have known for years and full of things they love doing and a sense of home and community and wonder. Who know what they like to do for fun and see people regularly that they know and care about. Have passions and interests and goals and plans for the future and what they want to do even if that's just more of whatever little things they enjoy. 

I feel so lost, I don’t have anything I like in my life and have wasted so many years losing any kind of joy and now I just have to be here??? And figure it out??? Find shit that l like doing when I've spent so long hating everything and doing nothing and talking to no one?? I've ruined like 95% of the relationships and opportunities l've had and I just have to start from scratch now? So many other people who did drugs that Ive talked to at least had something to go back to in their life.

what am I supposed to do with all this nothing???? I am so full of nothing and my life is full of nothing and I can't stop doing nothing and wanting nothing. Like great now I want more in theory, but what does that do for me right now besides make it more painful to have nothing??? And I don't enjoy anything. I can't think of anything I want to actually do. I give myself a goal and I get there and it's like- great, now what? It doesn't mean anything. I'm completely alone and I don't care. Why should I care about my life marginally improving when there's no one to share it with and it feels completely meaningless.

I think of my future and it's like this- I could go finish high school/get my ged, go to college, move away, but I don't actually find any hope in the idea. Then I'd just be in school, still hopeless. I'd just be somewhere else, still me, life still bleak. I got my drivers license finally, got promoted, am trying to talk to people more, make an effort, reach out- but it all feels so empty and trite. It doesn't mean anything to me, I can't connect with anyone, I don't know anyone. When I talk to people it's forced. I don't have anyone I speak candidly with. it's going to take so much work and I don't have the energy, yeah I know I can eventually get there but what am I supposed to do until then and how long exactly is it going to take?
I don’t really fully believe it’s possible for me. I’ve always struggled with or had complicated relationships with people, I’ve been mentally ill since I was a young teenager, and I’ve never gotten over anything that’s ever happened in my life, and now all of a sudden I’m an adult who can’t cope without hard drugs, flooded with everything I never dealt with and this horrible constant void of loss in my chest, with absolutely nothing to look forward to, no light at the end of the tunnel. 

Most people my age still talk to their high school friends, have connections to the world- I know I’m young, but I feel so old. I’ve wasted my whole life so far and have no idea how to pick up the pieces and move forward when I’m so painfully ill equipped and behind compared to my peers. The last time I was sober this long I was a child. I have no idea how to mourn the loss of an adolescence I barely remember and accept that I’m an adult I don’t even recognize with apparently no capacity for joy. Everyday I feel lost and confused, I don’t feel real. I’ve spent so long closing my eyes and standing still that I have no idea how to move forward or live my life, and any time I do make a change I can recognize, it’s terrifying and I want to run back to the safety of stagnancy. 

The only thing that gets me through the day is living in fantasies of the past that can never happen. I don’t want to be so old at 24 and so young somehow, too. The grief of who I was and could have been, and the friends I’ve lost to overdose, or to my own poor choices, the things I saw and experienced so young, it’s unbearable and I have the emotional regulation skills of a 14 year old. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m in therapy, I’m on medication, I go to meetings, I’m even trying to exercise and take supplements. I hate taking care of myself, I want to be better but I hate everything that gets me there. I don’t want to white knuckle my way through life. I’m tired of being alone with all my nothing. How can I dig myself out of this?? Or at least get out of my own way??",45

To every addict and recovering addict out there—especially those battling opiates—this message is for YOU.

No two paths to recovery look the same. Some of us fall a hundred times before we ever get back up. Some lose everything before they find their reason to fight. But no matter how deep the hole you're in, recovery is possible.

You don’t have to do it perfectly. You don’t have to have all the answers. You just have to take the next step… and then the one after that.

You are NOT too far gone.
You are NOT hopeless.
You are NOT broken beyond repair.

You are stronger than you know, more worthy than you believe, and capable of change beyond your imagination.

I’ve been through the fire. I know what it's like to feel like you’ll never make it out. But I’m almost 5 years clean now...

When you’re ready—truly ready—to stop using, your healing will begin. And with every day clean, you’ll remember what it feels like to be alive again.

Keep going. You’re not alone. And you’re not weak for struggling—you’re powerful for continuing to try.

✊ You’re worthy of recovery.
❤️ You’re worthy of love.
🌟 And your life is not over—it’s just beginning.

I guess I’ve been lucky because my old doctor was so kind and understanding- I really felt heard when I spoke and truly felt like he cared about my well being. This QuickMD doctor didn’t even treat me like I was a human- first off only part of her face was even in the frame which I thought was odd, she was immediately rude to me for no reason, had no interest in what I had to say when trying to explain what has been going on and what meds have helped me in the past.

76,1je6nnc,A junkie's creed,[deleted],36,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1je6nnc/a_junkies_creed/,"I've spent probably 14 years of my life off and on opiates and I'm on a low dose maintaience now. I'll never forget being almost a year clean when i read a post, I think on reddit from someone who was years clean, almost a decade.

 It started like a speech from a speaker in NA. Very anti-addiction, hopeful, and grateful, then slowly crept into territory of realism, and finally collapsed into a full blown love letter to Heroin, like an ex-lover from your 20 somethings you thought would be the one, and you've since ""moved on"". Have a wife and kids, or vice-versa, yet that memory still lingers and the slow crawl and simple pleasures of life don't seem to scratch that same itch. This person literally went from saying they were so glad to be clean, and ended the post by saying they might go cop literally at that moment. 

It was pretty heartbreaking to read because it really made me wonder, if this person is still feeling this way after almost a decade clean, will I ever not at least, kinda miss opiates? That was when I was about 22-23 and I'm 33 now. What the fuck man, lol. 

I say all this to say that I think the hardest part of giving up opiates is the realism that as far as knew. When I was maintaining, not obliterated, and not sick, just a happy medium between, and usually when I first relapse, people gravitate toward me, and the opiates make it very easy for all the awkwardness of social interactions to fade and transform into opportunities for friendship and even romance. Of course, to keep up with this long term becomes even more difficult though. 

It makes me feel like it's a double edged sword because opiates aren't like alcohol where people can clearly see you're under the influence and so they disregard the vibe your putting out. Opiates hijack the endorphin system and work behind the scenes to manufactor what appears to everyone else like genuine love, happiness, and desire. So long as you don't take it too far and look like an actual junkie or the people interacting with you don't know the telltale signs, but even then they'll tend to want to believe in that portrayal. 

The hardest part of being a junkie wasn't/isn't the maintaience of it. It's being comfortable and instantly in control of how you feel or need to feel, in any given situation, while watching the rest of the world chase the thing you have complete control over. It's like that monolouge in Trainspotting when he lists off all the things ""normal"" people chase. And in the end we're all chasing the same feeling, junkies just found a shortcut to that feeling. 

I'm not saying it's smart or right, we risk death, isolation, and suffering worse than death. No matter how on top of it we'd like to think we are and i realize that after 14 years with each year getting more out of control quality, price, and potency wise. 

Who knows maybe it's a different life for a junkie in somewhere where you can literally just buy pure, pharmacy grade opiates legally. I'd imagine so, but maybe that access would just make it worse since we all crave the control, and limitless control would probably not end too well, but i guess who knows. 

I'm kind of just rambling around the point though..

The point of this is, i got to a point in the past 3 years where I just felt like. Well..maybe this is my purpose in life..to be an example and a voice of reason, even if I can't help myself, maybe i can help people around me, and reason with them. After all I'm living proof, if you can't listen to me, then who tf are you gonna listen to? You're not gonna listen to people in sobriety, and you're not gonna hear out the people who've never lived it. I was content with that for a while, but in the winter it would get pretty lonely. And finally the few people in my family that still cared smacked me with reality and no amount of dope would block the pain of that dissapointment. 

It makes me look back at everything I just wrote and think.. Who tf do I think I am? Jesus or something? Lol. I probably felt like a god on opiates but in all reality was I ever really perceived like I felt I was? Was it even the opiates to begin with, or was it just my excuse to be comfortable with who I really am to begin with? Do I have am endorphin deficiency naturally? Wtf even is normal? Do normal people feel like how I did on opiates or am I just not content with feeling how normal people feel? So many questions dude...lol. 

BTW, I'm on 4mgs of methadone daily now, so idk I guess I'm just trying to confront myself and my addiction and really get to the root of everything. Trying to find a way to reclaim the life I built on opiates..without opiates. But every junkies just addicted to themselves technically and metaphorically. We're not addicted to ""opiates"" we're addicted to endorphins. We're addicted to love, happiness. Isn't everyone? Or...are they not?

If you are an addict, it is almost certain that you have essentially thrown away some significant portion or aspect of your life. Wasted something that you will never get back. I also wouldn't be surprised if that thing you wasted ended up being something incredibly precious to you, and the thought of that loss is soul crushingly difficult to cope with psychologically. It sucks.

Don't get me wrong. Regret is important. It serves a logical evolutionary purpose. It is a powerful indicator that is easily remembered. A quick reference alarm for you to use in the future to avoid the regretful mistake a second time. But we're addicts. I don't think it's a stretch to say we tend to take things to extremes. To excess. 

Regret is worthless to you if you wallow in it. Just like with our addictions, too much of something is almost always horrible. Every day you spend feeling sorry for yourself is another wasted day. Another day to Regret later. 

Do you want to come to the end of your life regretting the fact that you spent your entire life regretting all the things you fucked up? I certainly don't. I'll keep my Regret, but I'm going to use it to my advantage, not my detriment. I hope you do too.

Just appreciation for life in general. another chance to become a better version of myself grateful for this life and despite the hell addiction has put me and so many others thru, i genuinely believe i needed to experience it in order to truly appreciate what i do have, including the power to become any version of myself that i choose, provided i put in the required work. 

Anyways sorry for rambling. I’m about two days into my detox from heroin, using 7oh and alprazolam sparingly to make it possible to make it thru the last two days of work. I know it’s going to get worse before it gets better but I wish everyone the best in their journey of life, and hope you realize how much potential you truly have at any given moment. Much love!",29

The clock strikes three, the world's asleep,
Yet here I lie, the cravings creep.
A whisper calls, a ghostly pull,
That old dark hunger, never full.

Four long years, I've walked this line,
No pill, no high, just heart and mind.
I fight the urge, I stand up tall,
I won’t go back—I’ve seen it all.

For me, I stay, I choose the light,
Through every storm, through every fight.
But there’s a fire that burns so bright—
Her name is River, my guiding light.

Her laughter lifts me when I fall,
Her tiny voice, my wake-up call.
With little hands, she holds my heart,
Reminding me I’ve come too far.

And then there’s you, my love long gone,
Crystal, lost but never gone.
I swore I’d rise, I'd break the chain,
To honor you, to bear the pain.

Some nights are good, some nights are war,
But I won’t knock on death’s old door.
NA gave me tools to fight,
I use them all, I hold on tight.

I walk with God, He leads my way,
Without His love, I'd fade away.
Now passion fuels the steps I take,
To help the lost, to heal, to break—

The chains of others, just like me,
To show them there’s a way to be.
So when the cravings start to bite,
I pray, I stand—I win the night.

82,1j3s6g2,almost slipped up. needed to tell someone,RavioliMeThtFormuoli,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1j3s6g2/almost_slipped_up_needed_to_tell_someone/,"idk what's been going on with my head lately. been clean from crack and dope for 2 years. this last month i have not been able to stop thinking about crack..i use kratom to stay off dope which works for me. idk why i crave crack so badly. i hated every second of it after the rush wore off. made me paranoid borderline schizophrenic and i would pick my face till it bled. i'm a normal looking guy with a nice car and nice job, you wouldn't assume by looking at me that i smoked and used for 8 years. the last few days i kept dreaming about crack smh lmao. then i found out i'm off work tomorrow...and my mind went into autopilot...

normally i would call my guy, but i moved and changed numbers when i got clean, so there is no guy for me to call (which is for the best). however, i live 15 mins from one of the largest open air markets on the east coast / mid atlantic. i hopped in my car and drove to the city. the whole drive there i felt guilty and gross. but i ignored those feeling and pushed forward. i drove down the main stretch and turned down the side streets however no one was posted, cops were out in full force (an officer was murdered a week ago).


with no luck finding anyone and the guilt getting stronger, i decided to turn around and head home.  i couldn't stop thinking about getting jammed up by the cops, how bad i used to look from picking my face tweaked out on rock...how paranoid and schizophrenic it made me feel...before hoping on the highway i stopped at a corner store and parked up with no plan in mind. 

this ""down on his luck"" looking dude walked up to my window and asked me if i could buy him a soda and some blunt wraps. so i did, i don't mind helping someone out. when he came out i asked him if he knew where i could score a 20 of rock. he knew a spot..he told me he was gonna run to the house across the street and grab it, and he would be right back. he didn't ask for my money, he just told me to wait. after he walked away a cop pulled in and parked next to me, cop ignored me and ran into the store. 

i left immediately and drove home. i took the cop arriving as a sign to not go thru with the deal. by that point the guilt and self hatred had filled my body.

i'm currently sitting in a wawa parking lot typing this before i spend that $20 on dinner. 

idk who is going to read this but thank you for letting me vent to you. i don't have anybody in my personal life who i can tell this to and keeping it inside makes me feel worse. i live alone with my dog and have virtually 0 friends, and currently can't afford therapy yet. typing this out makes me feel a little better. love you all thank you for reading my message as i try to work thru these feelings",31

I won't say this is a success story because it's ongoing and mainly I don't want to get too cocky, but we should celebrate every minute we're clean. I have actual hope for my life which really trips me out. I can't remember how long it's been since I've felt that. I'm not buried by my shame and guilt. My focus isn't in my past only paying attention to what's behind me. Those chains aren't holding me back anymore. For the first time in my life I have found real acceptance for myself. I can unapologetically be me. 

Recovery actually seems possible to attain. One day at a time. One hour at a time. One minute at a time. I've found NA to be a lifesaver for me but I don't want to preach. I just want to say it's possible. We owe it to ourselves to scrape, claw, and fight for our freedom. We owe it to ourselves to exhaust every option to arrest our disease. We deserve to live life clean. We are all worth it. As hard as it to believe that sometimes, we are all worth it. 

Remember that you are not alone. Give yourself some grace. Give yourself a hug. Love and accept yourself. You are worth it and deserve it",21

It wasn't by choice, and I'm in pain, extremely exhausted, and depressed. But I feel more clear? I feel like I just got sucked out of my head back into the real world. I'm no longer in a state of constant dissociation, but I kind of preferred that after a while. Feeling real again is a rollercoaster, but I also feel like this is the beginning of having a normal, fulfilling life. I have such mixed feelings about this. I want my brain to be like everyone else's. That's all I want. I want to be happy and energized. I don't know why I can't feel normal by myself. 

The opiates somehow kept me awake, focused, and productive? Downers have worked better than any prescription stimulant I've had, honestly. Wtf. I'm just grieving my productivity and energy, I guess. I think I'm grieving everything I've ever felt in my brain that made me content. I don't even know what I'm trying to say anymore. I just want to be happy, and I want to feel like myself. Everyone is so happy for me for finally breaking my addiction and so happy that I am no longer in withdrawal. I feel empty though, like I don't have the ability to be happy. Did I ever really feel whole though? I don't know.

91,1iw5bsa,Running out of pills - was going to buy more but just stumbled into this sub and decided that I’m going to quit instead,RainbowBlak,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1iw5bsa/running_out_of_pills_was_going_to_buy_more_but/,"10 years ago, I (f, at the time 23) was prescribed a repeat script for codeine due to back pain. This marked the start of a decade long battle with opioid addiction. The script was stopped cold turkey about 18 months later but by that time I was already deep into addiction territory. I have stopped/started over the years but never really had any inclination to fully quit. About a year ago, I moved onto dihydrocodeine, which I buy from an online pharmacy. I go through withdrawal hell every single month due to the restrictions they place on ordering, and I hate it. I receive a monthly prescription of Gabapentin for genuine nerve damage and I always take them too fast in order to enhance the high from the pills, then I leave myself to suffer the nerve pain for the rest of the month, which also sucks. 

I am down to my last few dihydrocodeine pills and my plan was as follows - 2 this morning, 2 this evening, then 3 tomorrow morning as a “treat” because tomorrow is my birthday, then I’m out until I can re-order. I’m already experiencing some withdrawals due to the dosage decrease but I know they will hit full force once I fully run out. After I post this, I’m going to email the online pharmacy I purchase them from and ask them to disable my account. 

About an hour ago I found this sub and out of curiosity read a couple of posts. A couple turned into a few more, then a few more and now I’m sat here re-evaluating my whole life. Reading the heart-warming, inspiring journeys from those of you who have quit (and those of you who are in the process of doing so) has been nothing short of an epiphany for me. I’ve realised that I don’t want to spend my life in a cycle of opiate abuse and withdrawal. I don’t want to feel like the only way I can feel happy and experience joy is by chemically altering my brain. I don’t want to find out that a friend has recently been prescribed some opiates for a genuine medical reason, then spend the rest of my day subtly mentioning this “pain” I’ve been having in a way to build up to asking for some 😭 

I have a little girl who deserves a mum that doesn’t cycle through phases of being energetic/happy/full of life to fatigued/irritible/feeling ill each month. 

I will have to do this on my own as my husband and family have no idea about my addiction. I have been hiding this for 10 years, which has been stressful in itself, and also something that my husband does not deserve. 

I know that there will be 1000’s of tips if I search this sub, but if anyone wants to drop them here too I would be grateful. Saying that - one of the most irritating (but not worst) withdrawal symptoms I always face is a runny nose. Is there anything that helps with this? 

Anyway, I know that in terms of addictions, mine is on the milder end of the opiate spectrum, but it has been hell for me nonetheless. So, from the bottom of my heart I want to say thank you to each and every one of you. You are all inspirational and without this sub I’m not sure I would have ever reached this decision. I’ve honestly never felt determination like it. I know it won’t be easy, and there will probably be setbacks and road bumps along the way, but I really don’t want to live like this anymore. 

Good luck to those of you on your own journeys to sobriety and a huge well done to those of you who have already reached it. Love to you all 🩷

92,1iq46sw,I can’t cope being sober,Soft_Operation3953,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1iq46sw/i_cant_cope_being_sober/,"I’m 21m, I got out of rehab 2 months ago for a 2 year oxy, benzo and tramadol habit, that was on  and off but kept getting progressively worse up to about 70mg oxy a day and various benzos. I came out of rehab with the mindset that I want to to give sobriety a go and obtain full abstinence from all mind/mood altering substances. Not even 2 weeks out I picked up Kratom. Then found some sleeping pills, started taking those, then started having the odd drink out. All while living with my parents telling them I’m sober. Then I picked up pregablin and got caught the next day. Now it’s been a month since then and my life is coming together, I’m back in the gym, running, got a job, starting my last year of varsity. But my emotional regulation is fucked, and I’m still using sleeping pills, Ritalin and had 1 relapse on oxy. 

There are days like today where I feel immense sadness, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, and all I want to do is use oxy. I think the only thing that’s stopping me, is the fact that I live with my parents. I know that if I was left to my own devices, I would have picked up ages ago. I dont want to be feel this way, I don’t want to use oxy and fuck my life up more. But I feel so overwhelmed by everything and just want it all to go away, and feel safe. Don’t get me wrong there are good days sober, but the bad, are really bad. And I see no way or point to carry on with life without using. I feel lonely, my confidence is shattered, I don’t have many friends that I can see, my gf broke up with me whilst I was in rehab, I’m yearning for connection. 

I don’t know how to navigate this, I know intellectually getting sober is the right thing to do, and I want to. But emotionally I cant win. Life feels too hard sober, and I ask myself, what’s the point. 

Anyways there my vent, hope you can relate Please please please, don’t use opiates if you haven’t already, they will flip your life upside down forever, within the blink of an eye. ",49

I’m 20 years old and currently 8 days clean from opiates. I’ve been in a clinic and I’m doing my best to rebuild my life and get through this.

I wanted to ask: when do the withdrawal symptoms and mental pain start to ease up? I’ve read a lot of posts saying things get better after about two weeks is that really the case?

Right now I’m on pregabalin, and while I was in the clinic they also gave me Valium to help with sleep, since I’ve had severe sleep problems ever since I was a kid. Sleep is still rough, but maybe slightly better than it was.

Yesterday I forced myself to go outside, get some sunlight and move a bit. It wasn’t easy, but I think it helped. Should I be pushing myself to do that more often, even when everything in me wants to stay inside?

Now I feel stuck. I don’t want to go back on methadone it messed me up physically, and I promised myself I wouldn’t return to it. But I also can’t keep doing this. I’m tired. I’m scared of spiraling deeper, and I’m not sure how to break this pattern again

I’m sharing this not for sympathy, but because hiding it only feeds the shame.

I'm so proud of myself for getting on MAT and getting my life back together.

  
Last year, my account would have shown around -$800. Yes, negative. Since I get weekly direct deposits, my bank would allow me to overdraft up to $800 on my account. As I'm sure you can guess, this was awful and left me in and endless cycle of overdraft fees and debt. I would get my weekly pay (roughly 1k USD) and since I was so in the red, I'd end up with about $150 - which would right away go to my dealer. Then I'd spend the rest of the week trying to scheme some money until payday. I make $77k a year but was always broke and scrounging around my car for change to put some gas in.

  
My bank also has an get your pay early feature. Only issue is, it wouldn't always be early. Sometimes I'd get paid Wednesday, sometimes Friday. So you can imagine how it felt when it wouldn't come Wednesday.

  
I've been on MAT since December of 2024 and I can honestly say it changed my life. There was always a stigma when I'd ask about MAT, usually something along the lines of 'you're just getting addicted to something else!'. However, if you're already addicted to fent/blues, what's it matter? At least this way you're not waiting 45 minutes in a sketchy neighborhood getting 'im around the corner' texts. You're not worried about where you'll get your next high. You're not worried about getting some bunk shit, spending all your money, and still being sick. In my experience, I haven't had a single negative effect from the Methadone!

  
I went from spending up to $300 a day on blues to now getting bi-weekly takehomes and only paying $55 a week. It's truly changed me as a person and helped me develop better habits. Getting high or getting sick is no longer on my mind. 

I'm able to be present for my beautiful girlfriend and my awesome dog. I'm able to give them anything they want, whenever they want! I'm able to setup all my bills on auto-pay! I'm able to save money! I'm able to get anything I want!

  
I just wanted to share a bit of my story and hopefully inspire someone. Getting your life back together is possible, no matter how deep in it you are! Take it step by step, day by day. There are a ton of resources out there - you just have to look!",9

I have a paid off car, decent job and more money in my savings than I ever thought possible and yet I feel unhappy. I tried fast station pills, 7-oh, and for a few days I had an issue with those until I put them back down.

I used because I’m lonely, depressed and feel humiliated, my family doesn’t actually care about me but pretend they do, at some point in life nearly all of them have screwed me over in some capacity, I remember trying to get help with my mental issues and being shamed, when I accomplish anything(like getting my pilots license) no one cares, but they’ll make fun of me when I date someone and call her ugly or make fun of me for dating a white girl.

I had to move back in with my parents and it sucks like a Hoover vacuum here, they don’t care about how I feel day to day but pry into my life whenever I try to find a moniker of happiness.

I have had social and intimacy issues since a child, I live a lonely life and sometimes I still think of killing myself because I can’t bare the idea of living like this for multiple decades in the future.

104,1j8lk4n,12 Years of Heroin Addiction: My Journey to Recovery and a New Life,[deleted],31,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1j8lk4n/12_years_of_heroin_addiction_my_journey_to/,"Hello everyone. I’ve been on this sub for a month, and I’ve read some stories that have really touched me. Every time I read your stories, I see myself reflected in them in some way. Deep down, I believe that we, the addicts of the world, form a kind of brotherhood

Today, I want to share my story. I hope that someone can relate to it or that it helps someone make the decision to quit drugs. If it helps even one person, that will be enough for me.

The first time I smoked heroin was one night in early summer 2008. I was struggling with depression, tired of not having any excitement in life. It was a conscious decision. I was 22 years old, freshly graduated from university, and I didn’t know what to do with my life. My friends were starting to build something meaningful with their lives and were drifting away from me. And on top of that, my girlfriend had left me for another guy (I don’t blame her—the other guy was simply better than me, and she was very considerate, trying to make sure the breakup didn’t affect me psychologically). I felt very lonely and miserable. I had tried other drugs before—mainly cocaine and speed—but I hadn’t gotten hooked on any of them. However, I knew heroin was different. I knew it even before I started using it.

It was easy to get started. I just went to the neighborhood in my city where I knew drugs were sold, bought some, and used it right there in the same house. A girl who was using there guided me through the process of preparing the drug. Later, we became friends. I liked the feeling I got from heroin (I’m not going to go into more detail here). The next day, I woke up at noon, and the first thing I thought about was going to buy more. I remember being fully aware that if I gave in, I would fall into a deep, dark pit with no easy way out. I held out until 3 in the afternoon, and at that hour—during the hottest part of the day, in the hottest summer on record in my area at the time—with my body and mind sluggish from the sun and the scorching air, I thought, ‘Screw it,’ and got dressed to go buy more.

What followed, for twelve incredibly long years, was exactly what I expected—the full package. A series of highs, withdrawals, escapes, struggles, misery, happiness, sadness, absolute depression… A total chaos of emotions and experiences: car accidents, hospital admissions, family gatherings ending in tears, stealing from my parents, getting fired from one job after another… Summarizing those 12 years in a single paragraph feels so surreal. Every day without drugs was like an entire lifetime—it was as if my life was on pause and wouldn’t resume until I got my dose. Everything revolved around heroin. I would sit down to watch a TV show, and my mind would be focused on getting drugs. I’d go to work and only think about finishing my shift so I could go buy some (some days, I even smoked at work). Then, when I used, I felt completely guilty and miserable. Many times, I didn’t even get high—I just did it to feel physically okay.

Luckily, I managed to hold up physically. I put my body through infinite stress from cycles of use and withdrawal, from which I’ve fortunately come out relatively intact. But psychologically, I ended up devastated. It wasn’t until 2020 that I finally managed to detox completely.

I have to say that at no point during those 12 years did I feel like a victim. I suffered a lot, I regretted starting, of course—I cried rivers of tears—but I knew that I and only I had chosen that path. And I had done it with full knowledge of my actions.

Today, I’ve rebuilt my life. I’m far away from drugs (my only current vice is vaping, and I’ve also quit drinking alcohol). I live alone with my cat, and I have a good job. What I went through during all those years now feels very distant, yet at the same time, it’s as if it all happened just yesterday. I don’t let my guard down—I’m still very afraid of relapsing, but for now, I don’t think that will happen, even though I still have bad days. I feel like I’ve lost 12 years of my life, my entire youth, and that I’ve become a more cynical and less joyful person. I’ll probably never get those years back, but I’m okay with that. Thanks to my psychologist, I’ve managed to make peace with myself, and my parents have forgiven me for everything I did, but I’m still very hard on myself for some of the things I did. I still have work to do moving forward. But that’s okay—I have the strength to do it.

If you have read this far, thanks!. I don’t care where you’re from—whether it’s the USA, Europe, Australia, Pakistan, or anywhere else—you're important to me. I apologize if I’ve made any grammatical mistakes—English is not my native language (I’m from Spain), and although I speak some English, given how long this text is, I translated it using AI.

Lastly, I hope all of you manage to break free from drugs. Living without them is worth it, even though the fight is so hard.

Greetings to you all.",11

My New job is going REALLY good and they want to keep me in that field. Thats a really nice building Block for my New clean future and also something I would have never accomplished on opioids.

I can finally last longer in bed again that was a problem in the beginning. Libido was huge but I came in seconds.
My body feels mostly normals. Sometimes I yawn a bit and my mouth gets watery but thats really rare. In the first 1-2 months only 2 days were good in the week. In the third month I would say almost 4 days and now every week I got 5-6 good days and maybe one or two where I dont feel as good.

I seem to be almost over the hurdle of paws and if I can do it after 7 years of heavy opioid use ANYONE can.
I still need to fix my life that I Destroyed.

I still smoke some weed after I Finished my Workout, my job and anything Else I got to do. I know thats a crutch but hey its not extreme and when i got some more clean time I will try to tackle that problem too!

He doesn’t speak to me and truly doesn’t care that I got better. I literally disappeared from his life one morning in pitiful shape and he was just happy that I was gone. 

I keep wondering what was so wrong with me that I didn’t have what many other addicts have. I had no one cheering for me on the sidelines. I keep seeing stories of grieving spouses who lost their husbands/wives/partners to addiction and I wonder why they were lovable but I wasn’t. Almost all of us are hard to deal with in addiction to some degree or another but I feel like most people are given grace knowing that the person is separate from the addiction. I just keep feeling so unlovable and like something is really wrong with me.

Always ended up back at mom's. Even tho I asked her to help me stop, I charmed and lied that I had control and the cycle would start all over. At my worst I was 300-400 MG of oxy a day.

I caught myself pretty quickly and told her if she gives me any more pills I'm kicking her out. Fast forward and my son has arrived, life is wonderful. I have a slip and ask again. Sure enough she gave me some. I kept it to weekend Ms for a while pre usual and eventually everyday again. You know how it goes. We'll I don't have the heart to kick her out and had another convoy with her how I really need to stay clean from these things and I need support from my parent. Not a dealer.

112,1i0nzhv,One week sober ,[deleted],30,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1i0nzhv/one_week_sober/,"For the first time in three years of taking opiates daily, I’ve made it through an entire week sober. It’s a milestone I never thought I’d hit, and I’ve been reading so many stories on this sub, both inspiring and heartbreaking but that has been a huge source of motivation for me.

I know my story isn’t unique. I’m in the same position as millions of others, I have a good life. No one knows about my addiction, but it’s been quietly tearing my life apart. Over the years, I’ve withdrawn from friends and family, stopped going out, and became a shell of myself. The changes were gradual, so subtle that people around me didn’t notice.

Last year was the worst for me. I isolated myself almost completely. Even when I did see people, I couldn’t wait to get back home. My entire life revolved around finding, stocking, and planning for these pills. I didn’t see myself as an addict but just as someone who needed them, like anti depressants. I didn’t want to post here until I had something to show for it or until I could say I’d made real progress.

Now, after just one week sober, I’m starting to feel like myself again. I know it’s still very early, but I’m feeling back to myself. 

I know this isn’t the kind of post that’s interesting—no robberies, no dramatic rock bottom. But I think that’s the point. Most addicts aren’t the stereotype we think of. Many of us live in nice homes, hold good jobs, and keep up appearances. We don’t talk about it because of the embarrassment,  (that’s why I’m here and not telling my family) and because we don’t see ourselves in the public perception of what “an addict” looks like. 

Right now my life is saveable but if I lost my job and family, there’ll be no reason for me to get sober. So I hope someone who’s going down a same path makes the decision now before it gets worse.

We’re missing the bridge to treatment, and it’s costing lives",HexMarine,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1ox197c/narcan_saves_people_but_fentanyl_kills_them_again/,"Narcan saves lives, but fentanyl is killing people again in the hours and days after they’re revived. That “post-overdose window” is the most dangerous part of the entire crisis, and right now there is zero medical tool designed for it.

Clinics can start someone on Suboxone, but only after withdrawal begins. With fentanyl, that can take 24–72 hours. If you start too soon, you trigger violent precipitated withdrawal. It’s not a failure of Suboxone — it’s a timing problem the system has never solved.

And this is where people die. They walk out of the ER or away from EMS, use again to feel normal, and overdose a second time. It’s the deadliest 48-hour period in modern public health.

What’s missing is a bridge between Narcan and treatment.

We need a field-ready, fentanyl-safe buprenorphine induction device that lets EMS, clinics, or outreach teams slowly microdose buprenorphine in a way that doesn’t trigger precipitated withdrawal. The science already exists. The delivery technology already exists. This is not futuristic. It’s just unbuilt.

The only reason it doesn’t exist is the same reason Narcan almost didn’t:
there’s no immediate profit in building it. Once the public demanded Narcan as a necessity, companies found a way to make it. The same could be true here.

This device would stabilize people right after overdose — the exact moment they are most likely to die — and give them a safe path into actual treatment.

We talk a lot about the opioid crisis, but nobody is talking about this missing tool.
If we’re serious about saving lives in the fentanyl era, this has to be part of the conversation.

I just got kicked out of trying to bribe them for another night. I demand you give me a free room as I enter the lobby with a bed bug in a cigarette plastic. Plus, it was still alive. Look at these bites as I take my shirt off in front of them. Scores of them all down my side. Look! “The manager says sir we found needles in your room after we switched you the night before and gave you a free room.” “So what I’m a fucking diabetic, I’m going to sue your asses” the dude scoffs and says “your insulin is heroin? There was blood in the needle not to mention the cigarette butt cottons”.

I was desperate to quit for months as it was destroying my relationship and my work and was no longer fun to use, it was just a weekly tax that stopped me from being sick. I was spending roughly $7000 a month on longtecs and basically stopped me working (self employed) and caring about about anything.

I went completely cold turkey and it was excruciating. I was twitching, sick, not sleeping for the first 5 days. I then bought a few blisters of xanax and managed to knock myself out for a few days. I've been addicted to valium for 10 years but don't ever up my dose. However the xanax gave me painful withdrawals.

I've been through H withdrawal before (smoking it for 4 months) but a year of oxy was 10x worse. However nowhere near as bad as benzo withdrawal which I wouldn't wish on anyone.

2 weeks after stopping was surprised to start getting my energy back and a bit of sleep. I have very little opiate cravings at all. However now close to a month and don't have my appetite back - I've actually lost a lot of weight since stopping.

I've now finally been able to travel again, I was trapped for a year due to the addiction. The best cure imo is leaving all your triggers behind and moving elsewhere. I wiped my phone and cut ties even with close friends which I feel incredibly bad about but will have to explain once I'm sober longer.

I still struggle with alcohol and coke but nothing beats not having to wake up everyday wondering how to score oxy and feel sick of the disgusting amount of money you spend on them.

I work freelance and made some terrible decisions while on oxy, and have come out sober but also minus 500k to almost zero and pretty much rebuilding my financial life / family life again.

There is always hope, I was afraid to ask for help but worked through it with my partner for 2 weeks while sick.

I've been through suboxone detox before but nothing beats the feeling of achievement of stopping cold turkey and dealing with it on your own.

I was searching this sub before I decided to detox, looking for hope so thought I'd leave a note here.

Me and P were super close, we were together pretty much every single day for 6 years, half of high school and all of my college, lived together for a year. After that, i had 2 kids immediately after graduating from college, so i didnt really see him anymore.

P is the child of 2 alcoholic parents, and he got started drinking and smoking really young.  In the years since, hes had about every bad thing happen to him that can happen to someone with a poly drug addiction. His life would fall apart, hed go to rehab, get a job and car and apartment. Then hed go back out, crash the car, lose the job and end up homeless. Like 20 times of that cycle. You guys know how it goes. So the last time he ended up in the hospital with sepsis and multiple infections, mrsa, wounds, the works. He wasnt expected to survive. His mom didnt bother coming around. His dad came by and told him 'looks like youre not going to make it so im going to turn in the plates on your car.' P said ok. Nothing else to say i guess.  Idk why, but that hit me hard. 

So hes made it over 2 years sober now. Hes a carpenter now, works for a builder and hes a foreman. He and his mom bought a townhouse together. Last time i talked to him when right when he got out of the hospital. Hadnt seen him in probably 7 or 8 years.

Hes just such a great person, kind of a space cadet, so funny and under it all just a really caring sweet fun guy. Im just so thankful to see him doing good. I was thinking about it this morning and came to tears, thinking about how his addiction has caused him to suffer all these years. 

I was really thankful to see him.

123,1paurq1,Today after 4 days CT I caved and bought pills.,BW-Journal,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1paurq1/today_after_4_days_ct_i_caved_and_bought_pills/,"So today I got the opportunity to get pills and I did. I caved. In my head it was going to be great. After a break it would feel good again. And I know this is dumb but as my withdrawal was so fast I really thought it was going to be an easy thing to do and recover from. The devil on my shoulder taking I know.

Something happened today to make me extremely angry. I work full time and Im not on a bad wage but my god living expenses are so high I feel like I'm in poverty. I lost it for a while.

I can't speak about recovery but it was a total waste of time and money. I literally got zero out of it. No good feeling, nothing at all. I feel guilty for caving but it really showed me how little this drug was doing for me. I got absolutely nothing from it and I don't think I'll be going back any time soon. It was such a build up and such a let down.

I'm grateful really for it teaching me this lesson. I'm going to restart my counter from tomorrow but I'm not going to forget the progress I made. This is still on. I slipped and it did nothing for me. I'm done here. ",15

I wanted to switch so I could hoard it and sell it to get more food and whatnot, ended up getting caught and given a choice of taking the sublicade shot instead of getting weened down off suboxone 2 mg every 2 days or something even more dramatic lol. Got the shot and told myself I would only get it once instead of every month because my buddy had it once and never again, said he never had withdrawals what so ever. Got the shot October 10 2024, November 10th 2024 a guard came to my cell and woke me up telling me it was time for my next shot and I refused. He asked if I was sure because he didn’t want me whining about it later because I won’t get it. I said no problem,beat it basically lol and the small lump under the skin on my stomach was noticeable until maybe January? But that’s really looking and only because I knew it was there. It’s now July 4th 2025 and I’m straight chilling no opiate use what so fucking ever. Been out since January and I take nothing except my Valium and adderall. Never had any withdrawal. I would recommend this to anyone 1000x over staying on methadone or whatever the fuck else is out there. I’m from Canada in Ontario and I am opiate dependency free. I’ve had a few tokes of fentanyl but that’s all, i even have a bit of a tolerance I felt like but never think that when it comes to fentanyl, never that you can do more than usual. I’ve lost 13 friends and I’ve flatlined at least 10 times, overdosed and revived at least 35 times. Maybe more and surprisingly im not retarded. I use to see an ambulance reviving someone and I would ask the other users standing around what colour he had used and who had it, then going to get that stuff myself. Anything that had carfentanil was always sought after. So ya ask your Dr about Sublicade today! (Side effects may include release from physical dependency of opiates) 

If anyone actually reads this and takes the same actions make sure to come back and let me know.

Remember lads, don’t do drugs,          Without me.

128,1leyt9r,Someone asked in a previous post if their 30s is too late to get sober...so i wanted to share this with him and you guys as well.,Due-Violinist5278,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1leyt9r/someone_asked_in_a_previous_post_if_their_30s_is/,"u/IR30Lover this is my response and I really hope it helps you brother.

I noticed yoir concern in the comments was about ""accomplishments."" I dont blame you for asking. But accomplishments mean two very different things to me now in sobriety as opposed to being in my addiction. Materials? Career milestones? Financial gain? These are all idolized in the world I was in when I was addicted. They were also all that mattered to the people around me. They determined self-esteem and my personal worth. Ironically, I was an utter, complete piece of dog shit and seemed to have no real grasp of myself.

My brain was running on opiates for 20 yrs. From age 17 to age 37. By 37 I had lost my business. Lost my children. Lost my license. Lost my car. Filed for bankruptcy. I was a convicted felon never to be able to get a job at a McDonald’s, let alone something serious for my age. All relationships were gone. I had stolen from everyone. I had almost died from endocarditis from using IV drugs. My fiancée had died. My little sister had died from fentanyl after I had introduced her to opiates. My mother had turned into a miserable drunk in response.

I had literally no one. I had grown up in a wealthy area in North Florida. All of my friends were Drs and lawyers. I myself was kicked out of law school due to pawning something that turned out to be stolen. And here I was, 37. Unhireable. Not a single human to answer my phone call. Homeless, nowhere to sleep. And btw, I was high at work. Stepped off the ladder the wrong way and was now literally disabled. Completely blew out my ankle. Didn’t get the proper treatment and was now handicapped. I needed crutches to walk. So I’m a crippled homeless man withdrawing from dope and also dying of hepatitis C. I catch a ride to an AA meeting and a girl who knew me from years prior of trying to get clean gave me a hug. I broke down in tears and I asked her to help. That night she connected me with somebody at a sober living place.

If it hasn’t gotten this bad for you yet? Consider yourself lucky.

When I came into AA for the 4th or 5th time, I knew the drill. I knew if I did what a sponsor told me, I would get better. I put my ego aside. I had read enough business books and positive thinking literature to understand the value of a mentor and how his successful patterns would be kinetic. Life is a sum of patterns, habits, right? I’d adopt new ones.

A.A. was culty. I hated the religious aspect of it (or so I thought). And the first step is believing in a power greater than myself. It’s establishing a baseline. A psychological rest stop, a father to hand our problems and our faith over to. Because the hole we dug was high and our shovel was broken. I am so grateful I had had some time during incarceration where I had been connected to something higher than myself. I knew there was something buzzing out there that was real. Reading the Big Book and being able to actually feel something inside as I read certain sections of the book.

I had a ""spiritual experience"" in my past so I knew this is what came with the steps and the process. The thing that helped me this time around was viewing the AA meeting house like a battery. God existed to me at a specific higher frequency. In order to be in tune to His station, I have to maintain a vibration. In my addiction, my vibration was low. Thinking was low. Self-image, mood, aspirations— all of it was low.

So to be in tune with God, I had to plug in and charge up. When I physically could not be there, I had to maintain this vibration with actions, communication, and reading. So an AA meeting would charge me up. Reading the Big Book. Talking to other addicts or alcoholics. And most importantly, calling my sponsor. I had to call him every single day. If I wanted to adopt his life (a happy man with a wife and kids who admired him), then I would need to copy his behaviors.

So I would run my sick and unhealthy thinking through his processor every a.m. And man, for a guy who lost his father at 8 yrs old to drunk driving, having a man I could call for the first time in my life every single day— who would listen to every single one of my problems, bad ideas, and plans— and then he would say, “OK, this is how you should handle this”? That was something I had been missing my entire life that I didn’t realize I needed. It brought a lot of peace and confidence my way.

To make a long story short, I now operate in a different realm. One where “success” is measured by my relationships with other human beings, by love in my heart, and by peace and happiness. Almost 3 yrs later, there is a calm I feel now. It’s unlike anything I ever experienced, even before my addiction. I bootcamped sobriety pretty damn hard my first year. Several meetings a day. And while it’s the toughest and hardest part of getting clean, there is almost something I miss about it— the grind. The struggle. The fire under my ass.

I ended up getting reconstructive surgery on my leg. I started going to the gym for the first time in my life and getting into good shape. I can walk again. No more hepatitis C and a doomed liver. I have my own place. My kids live with me full-time. I have custody back. I’ve built a business that has just blessed me beyond anything I can imagine. I literally built it on crutches with a cellphone in my hand while being broke, newly sober, and sleeping on my grandmother’s couch. And now me and my kids travel all over. We can do whatever we want whenever we want. And the most important thing is we do it all together.

Am I successful? Yes, I’m happy. I’m at peace. People can depend on me. Every morning I wake up, it’s a blessing. It’s a gift that I am excited about taking on. And if you’re asking whether or not you will have this? If it’s too late for you? I’ll tell you no, it’s not too late. And what God has in store for you? You are unable to conceive with your wildest imagination. In 2016, I sat on my bunk bed in a correctional facility reading a page in the Big Book, where it made me a promise to me. When I read it, I got goosebumps. I will never ever forget that moment. Because the promise was big and it was appealing to me. It was what I wanted. And I can tell you, my friend— it came true. I’ll share it with you:

"" Established on such a footing we became less and less interested in ourselves, our little plans and designs. More and more we became interested in seeing what we could contribute to life. As we felt new power flow in, as we enjoyed peace of mind, as we discovered we could face life successfully, as we became conscious of His presence, we began to lose our fear of today, tomorrow or the hereafter. We were reborn.""

129,1jlv4zv,Methadone Stigma,[deleted],28,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1jlv4zv/methadone_stigma/,"I'm just posting this to say that if you've spent years fighting opiate addiction ON and OFF, and feel like there's no way out, and are like I was, completely disregarding maintenence, specifically Methadone or have tried Suboxone and still couldn't stop thinking about Opiates, you really should at least consider methadone. 

I tapered as low as I could stand off Fent, made it to almost nothing, literally grains a day, so small you couldn't even see it, and I still couldn't function so after a few people suggested methadone I finally said fuck it and went to the clinic. I know people who are still on it and some who used it to maintain and regain stability while tapering, but the one thing I feel is important to stress is that IT WORKS.

Stop feeling guilty or like your giving up on sobriety for considering it. If you're on the right dose all it's gonna do is take away cravings, make you feel normal with a bit of pain relief if you have chronic pain outside of withdrawl, and most importantly, keep you from caring about getting high anymore. Your receptors will be satisfied and you'll resume life as a normal, contributing person, capable of going to school, working, forming relationships, etc.

The trick is to be honest with yourself, you'll know if your taking too high or too low of a dose. In the beginning it's crucial to play around with the dose to see what's too low and what's too high. It took me about 2 weeks of starting at 20mgs and going as low as 4mgs for 3 days, 5mgs for another 3, and eventually doubling my take home for 5mgs to realize that 10mgs is my sweet spot.

I just went back to work and didn't miss a beat, and my job is moderately physical and a quick pace is crucial. I'm finishing my GED (last test) in 2 weeks and I was able to keep about 6/10s of my savings that I kept stacking up while on fentynal the past 3 years while planning my escape from fentynal, to use the $ for Tech schhol. 

Truthfully, I don't even hate fentynal  or any opiate. After all these years I finally realize, it was never their fault for the way i am, and it might not even be mine. Without opiates I probably would have killed myself tbh. I wasn't functional day to day, and today I can honestly say methadone makes my life more normal than it's ever been. 

I look forward to each day and don't gamble with my life anymore. Stop being so prideful about sobriety, is my advice. We have no issue with tossing pride and dignity out the window and selling it for a bag when we do fentynal. We said we'd never fo fentynal, remember? We said we'd never do Heroin.. we said we'd never smoke a perc.. said we'd never steal for a habit. Said we'd never be homeless, etc. You get the picture..

""FUCK PRIDE..it ONLY hurts, it NEVER helps"" 

At the very least, try it for a few days and plan a taper. Anything is better than fentynal. Sure heroin is coming back, at least in the NE, but it won't last, and it will be laced with fent still. And goof luck ever affording an oxy habit. Go to the clinic for free, or at a small copay. Even people without insurance pay less for the clinic than they do they're dope habit. 

We're junkies, stop acting like your above maintenence, it's not just about US, we effect the people we love, most of them already consider us dead so that it doesn't hit so hard if we do, and so they can still be excited when they do see us ""oh wow he's not dead yet!"" If you can't do it for yourself, at least do it so your loved ones aren't trapped anymore, it's not fair to them.

Anyway, Just my 3 cents ",29

131,1i1s42z,Reflecting on 6 years ,mirkodup,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1i1s42z/reflecting_on_6_years/,"I used to buy a week's worth at a time.  For those on the East Coast, I would grab 7 bricks, each of which had 5 bundles in them.  I was doing 1 brick a day.  Roughly $100 a day.  This was 6-10 years ago.

There was no better feeling than coming home from a reup knowing I was good for the next 7 days, although it was more like 5 or 6 days because I always messed up and went apeshit at least a couple times during the week and did more than my allocated daily amount.  The comfort of having my drugs and no worries because I made it home safe, didn't get robbed or arrested, and didn't have to go back out there for awhile.

Then around day 4 or 5, the stress and anxiety would start to hit.  All the worrying about where I was getting the money, how much I was spending, all the debt I was in, the places and people I would have to rob next because I NEEDED IT TO SURVIVE.  Hitting up the various plugs, venturing out to P-Town where I had absolutely no business being. I've been shot at, stabbed, done the stabbing, gotten beat up, beat other people up.  Got cheated and hustled and felt truly shocked.  ""How could anyone do this to me"" I always asked myself, obviously forgetting about all the horrible things I would do to secure the drugs. 

I justified it all. I wore a suit and tie everyday to work. A mortgage, car loans, bills.  A wife and kids who I had to support. Mouths to feed. ""Normal"" friends. Absolutely no one would look at me and think JUNKIE.  But I was a junkie of the highest degree.  The biggest scumbag.  A wolf in sheep's clothing. I hid it so well.  Never got caught, never OD'd, my wife and family didn't suspect a thing. I was living a lie, but which life was the lie and which was real? I didn't even know anymore.  Survival mode for years. Locked in and focused on making money, legally and illegally, so I could support the use. 

Trying over and over and over to get clean without admitting to anyone how badly I fucked up.  How could I ever admit something like that? Someone like me being a heroin addict? No fucking way.  I could never take the embarrassment and shame of it all.  What would my wife think? What would my family and friends think of me. They would see the absolute loser I really was and I was never going to let that happen.  Not while I was living anyway.  

I would build up the courage to quit. Brace for the shock of cold turkey withdrawal. Still had to wake up with the kids and get them ready for school.  Still had to go to work.  Still had to coach, go on camping outings and be the perfect husband and father I so foolishly duped myself into believing I was. Throwing up constantly, shitting my ass out, sweating, the body aches and pains, the feeling of NEVER GETTING COMFORTABLE.  The sleepless nights laying next to my wife in bed while she was sleeping. Through sheer white knuckle willpower I tried not to toss and turn... waiting for her to finally go to sleep so I could retreat downstairs and suffer through the night alone. Every night feeling like hours. The dread of dawn coming when the kids would wake up and I would have to face life without drugs.  

This wasn't sustainable.  I would make it 3 or 4 days.. a week tops. I couldn't take more than that.  Behind on work, wife getting concerned that I wasn't getting better from my ""stomach flu"", I had to pick up.  I promised myself a taper, use benzos, use cocaine to come off Heroin.  I tried everything.  Being sober never could actually stick.  How could it?  I was living in my own personal hell.  No one to talk to about it.  Alone in the pit of despair that was my conscious. I cannot describe how it felt. Thoughts of ending myself came often. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy. 

What a fuckin joke it all was. All for what?  So I could be numb for a few fleeting moments.  It didn't even feel good anymore.

This is already longer than it should be so I'll fast forward. After a couple years of the above cycle, I finally got arrested.  I ran out to get pizza for the family and didn't come back.  After hours and hours and hours the police finally let me make a phone call.  I called my wife to come bail be out of jail.  She was worried sick about me.  She thought I died.  I wasn't picking up my phone obviously, the police had it. Like the perfect wife she is, she didn't ask questions. She came straight to the jail and bailed me out.  

The jig was up. I broke down and told her everything. I'll spare you the details but to say she was pissed would be putting it mildly. Rightfully so. 

I was on the brink of losing my wife and kids.  I now had felony charges.  I was facing losing my professional license and my career of 18 years. My employer fired me.  Even with all this, I felt better than I did in years.  I finally could talk to someone about my addiction. The secrets were over! Something I never though was possible.  After opening up to my wife, I told my siblings, my parents, my in laws.  Everyone who was close to me.  And god damn I was never called a loser junkie.  All the fear I had was bullshit.

Finally, after being open and honest and with the support of my friends and family, I got clean.  It still wasn't easy, but holy shit was it easier than keeping all those secrets.  I could actually open up and talk about all these feelings that were creeping back.  I joined one of the fellowships. Holy shit there are other people out there who are just like me?  And they made it out the other side?  I couldn't believe it. I wasn't unique and I wasn't alone.  

6 years later and my life is back. My wife and I made it out the other side, we have a better relationship now then we ever had.  My kids are growing up, almost done with High School.  I can be there for them. Really be there without the fog and distraction of an opiate addiction.  My finances are back on track. I started over. I got a second chance.  I was able to hold my professional license and career because I was honest with the regulators about my addiction, it is a disease after all and I was getting treatment. I have a new better job now. 

That's pretty much my story.  If you made it this far your a champ.  I know I'm not some eloquent writer. I just want to say if you're out there struggling like I was then TELL ON YOURSELF.  There are people out there who who will love and support you.  Society loves a comeback story and is very forgiving for the addict who is trying their hardest to come back. 

DO NOT DO THIS ALONE. Find support, talk to people, be open and honest about your feelings. If you want it then fucking get it.  Do it like your life depends on it, because it does. You are worth it. Legends are born in the valley of struggle. Become a legend.

I don’t call myself healed. I call myself still here. That’s the only badge I wear.
If you’re tapering, if you’re cold turkey, if you’re on day 1 or day 1,000 your survival is the proof. You don’t have to be perfect, just present. You don’t have to glow, just breathe.
And if you feel like you’re alone, you’re not. Some of us built rooms out of our scars, places where you can bleed words instead of relapse. We call it UndergroundGods, but really it’s just people who get it.

136,1lrs0ph,Kratom helps with withdrawals… Psilocybin helps with staying clean why is no one mentioning this ?,Decent-Fun190,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1lrs0ph/kratom_helps_with_withdrawals_psilocybin_helps/,"Alright, I’ve been sharing a lot about kratom as a tool to get off opioids. Some people react positively, others are strongly against it and I get both sides. What I’ve noticed though, is that many people basically just swap their opioid of choice for kratom and assume that’s enough.

In my opinion, if you use kratom to get through opioid withdrawal, you should also plan to taper off it as soon as possible.

From my own experience, that’s when the real mental battle begins — the cravings, depression, endless thought loops… Psilocybin (mushrooms) helped me break those patterns and gave me a true mental reset.

And yet, hardly anyone talks about psilocybin in the context of addiction recovery. People struggle for years with methadone, Suboxone, even kratom — I see it all over Reddit — but rarely do I see people mentioning psilocybin as part of their recovery process. It’s not a magic pill, but honestly, it’s the closest thing to magic I’ve ever experienced.

To be clear: psilocybin won’t stop your physical withdrawals — but once you get through that phase, it can make a huge difference mentally. It’s non-addictive, not harmful to the body, yet rarely discussed when it comes to life after opioids.

For those interested: scientific research on psilocybin is already showing promising results in treating alcohol addiction, tobacco dependence, and even cocaine/crack use. The potential for mental health and addiction recovery is massive, but it’s still flying under the radar in most opioid recovery discussions.

Just thought I’d share that, hopefully it helps someone.",75

I’m so sick of living like this. I made a year clean up until a year ago, when I started chipping oxies again. That debt I paid off started to pile back up, and my use got higher and higher. 

By Christmas I was in full dependency, taking 90-150mg of pharma oxy per day. It was a Herculean effort to make my pills last through the holidays, but I did it. Unfortunately when I got back and got paid, I ramped right back up. 

I’ve half-asses tried to taper my oxy, but I always find a reason to take just one more, just one more, ok maybe another half… you know the drill. 

I’m petrified of being on subs long term. I’m very scared of experiencing acute withdrawals for a month. 

My goal is to only use the subs for about a week, using less and less each time to hopefully give myself a relatively soft landing into sobriety. Has anybody found success in this method?

I’d appreciate any feedback on my plan, or your experience using subs either long term or more in a rapid taper like I plan. 

Thanks all 💜💜💜 please wish me luck and send me good vibes. I need it. ",29

Both times I’ve quit (and other times where i went into wd because i was broke or couldn’t find supply) I get this awful feeling that I’m naked and everyone can see all my flaws. I’m already self conscious, but I pick myself apart when I’m not high, and it continues for weeks and weeks when I get sober. I feel so uncomfortable in my body, but don’t recognize myself when i see myself at the same time. It makes me want to peel my skin off, and the only thing that I’ve found helps is either hiding away in my room under 4 blankets, or taking something that acts on GABA receptors. I look the same as i did when i was using a month ago and i get convinced when im sober that my bf hates me, i have to hide from him in a way. Them on top of tgat going to work, or im trying to go to the gym again, if i see my reflection in a window or shiny surface it reminds me of how much i hate myself.

It’s been years since I have engaged with any online communities dedicated to opioid use. Back when I started using, 2012-ish, I was very into tumblr and I used to browse Jinxie’s Natural Habitat and I was very active on Reddit. I just remembered that blog, and it made me think to check up on the Reddit communities and see what’s going on. All these years later, it’s weird to think about and hard to even imagine that was me. 

Anyway, I’ve been completely clean from heroin/fentanyl for 5 years in November. My life is pretty normal now.  I remember my days of posting on Reddit looking for help with withdrawal, trying to manage the balancing act that is life with a heroin addiction. Eventually the heroin wasn’t heroin anymore and the game completely changed. Sometimes I credit my recovery to that fact alone, because fentanyl was nothing like the stuff I first started using. 

I just want to let you know that if you’re going through it right now, in any capacity, you’re going to be okay. Withdrawal sucks, but it’s nothing compared to a life of dependency. Just get through withdrawal and move forward, one day it will be a distant memory. We all end up dependent on one thing or another, let it be the pleasures of living a normal life. One you can be proud of. One without tons of secrets. ",15

Tldr: methadone is actually pretty great, if you're truly ready to fight your way off opiates. Happy to answer any and all questions. Heck, I'll give my opinion on your situation and a recommended road map if you want. 

I'm prescribed 300mg gabapentin for restless legs and it's been very helpful for this whole process. 

A bit of history. I'd say I spent 7 years on and off hooked on fentanyl. Started around 2017. I was sober most of 2020 with the exception of a pill I had mailed to me (stupid). Had a few months sober here and there. 

35m and I'm a bit of a mixed bag. Sharp, educated, but from a redneck alcoholic family. Dad owned a bar, so had money and nice stuff, but everyone I knew was always drunk. 4.0 in high school, but grew mushrooms at 17. Yada yada yada.

First opiates were codeine and morphine pills a friend stole from neighbors he was house sitting for. Apparently their medicine cabinets were loaded with expired pill bottles like you wouldn't believe. There were 6 of us - 3 guys and 3 girls - and 2 big zip locks full of misc stolen pills. Tramadol, codeine, morphine, seroquel, ritalin, ativan, and I don't remember what else. I do (kinda) remember 2 weeks straight of skittle parties every day after school. 

Then I didn't touch opiates for nearly a decade. Hurt my back at 25, got morphine from a neighbor, jumped to blues a couple years later, and you all know how that goes. 

Ended up ruining a 4 year relationship, lost the woman I intended to marry, spiraled for a bit. Fought it, fell back, fought it, yada yada, almost killed myself more than once. The war stories I could tell. 

So how'd I get off...? 

----------------------------------------

----------------------------------------hammer time

Was at 4-5 blues a day at my worst, mix of smoked for the rush and snorted for longevity. More often though I was doing 2-3 a day. March last year I tried to taper myself off fent, took a week off work, got down to a quarter pill a day but couldn't get off, was back to 1-2 a day by start of April. 

By May I became desperate. I had never wanted off this badly. It was like something shifted mentally. I was willing to do anything. I literally thought about just stabbing my dealer. I cut my debit card in half to make it harder to get cash. Didn't really help. 

I had always avoided methadone because of horror stories from a friend who was on it 3 years and struggled to get off, then just relapsed. I was desperate though. 

Started methadone mid May 2024. First tapered off Xanax I'd been casually abusing, then last fent dose was June 2nd. 

I was scared, and had LOTS of experience trying to taper myself off fent (once successfully in 2021), so convinced the doctor (nurse wasn't having it, tried to fight me) to let me start tapering methadone immediately. 

Started at 65mg methadone, dropped 5mg per week a few weeks, then 3mg per week starting around 35mg. I took several breaks where I was stressed or just needed time for my body to adjust. Stayed at 12mg from mid October through the new year because the holidays led to several relapses in the past. 

How'd it feel? Not fun, but not terrible. I didn't have to take time off work, though I was a dick to my boss more than a couple times. Slept decent most nights. Physical withdrawals weren't that bad, but emotionally I was a wreck. 

Mood swings. Nothing was fun. It was basically 11 months of rarely having a good time and hating life, but having dealt with chronic depression and anxiety all my life, it was nothing I hadn't felt before. Just stubbornly persistent. 

I basically withdrew from the world. I have 800 hours on Cyberpunk 2077, I've read about 20k pages (mostly wheel of time), and I've watched Lord of the Rings extended edition I don't know how many times over the last year. 

Got down to 2mg. Took my last dose 2 weeks ago today. First few days I slept like shit, but otherwise felt surprisingly OK. Like tired, moody, occasional hot flashes, but better than expected. 

Today I feel mostly great. Sleep is meh, but could be worse. I'm on top of laundry, mowed my lawn and worked on my garden today, in a pretty good mood. I wish I had done this all sooner. Life is beautiful. ",12

But I like to celebrate the fentanyl recovery. It’s a big deal to me. Fentanyl consumed my every thought action and emotion for over 3 years. I was a complete slave to it and just constantly obsessed with using it and getting more. Even for the first year after I quit my cravings haunted me like a goddamn monster and my body still hurt and I was so tired and miserable. I relapsed a lot. The pain is so hard to deal with. 


But I wanna say this to anyone who needs to hear it. I haven’t touched fentanyl in over five years. I go months at a time now without even thinking of it. I very rarely feel even a mild craving for it or any opiate. In the last year I’ve consistently reported feeling absolutely zero physical pain to my doctor at my monthly check ups. 

I used fentanyl all day every day for 3 years and I felt so fucking hopeless. It ruled my life. My brain. My soul. I was so certain and so scared that even if I managed to stay clean, the overwhelming obsession and desire would never leave me alone. 


I go months now without even thinking about it. And I know you can too. 

You have to hang in there. I know it’s painful. And you’re fucking brave for going through it. 

Stay safe. ",5

I would find a clinic, relapse, find a new clinic, relapse again. Rinse and repeat.

I've been clean for two years now. 

I remember the days where the only thing on my mind was making money to get my pills. I withdrew from anyone who cared about me and spent most of my time alone. 

Life is good now. I've found hobbies I enjoy, I'm happy, and I am at a point where I don't have cravings anymore.

151,1odpqce,Alcohol destroyed my Childhood. Opiates destroyed my adulthood.,Historical-Love-4097,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1odpqce/alcohol_destroyed_my_childhood_opiates_destroyed/,"Something that clicked this time around getting clean was why I got high in the first place.

My brother and I grew up in a single mother home, she divorced my father when I was about 9 and he was about 13. We had lived in an apartment that was supposed to be temporary until the whole family moved to a house in CT. We would look as a family and then one day our mother woke us up to go say bye to our father. It was sometime in the Fall.

After that, shit went downhill fast. My brother started sneaking off to smoke weed with his freinds, drink even tried coke around that age and pretty much whatever else he could.

 We were told out father was a ""functioning alcoholic"" and he was for sure, but he was a pretty easygoing drunk. He didnt hit us, he didnt verbally abuse us, pretty much the opposite tbh. He was excitable and fun to be around. Sometimes it sucked cause after the divorce he was pretty depressed and seeing my father cry, at my age, as a boy learning to be a man, it was kinda crazy to see. Im not judging, but here I am a kid, and I feel like I gotta lift this guy up thats supposed to be doing that for me. Still though, in comparison to what it was like living with our mother, it was kind of a blessing. 

Our mother was, according to herself, a ""weekend warrior"" she'd go out everyday from Thursday to Saturday and get hammered. Thing is though, she was also a bartender Monday Through Thursday. She grew up in alcoholic home herself and all 3 of her brother died from drinking. 

No one could put fear into me like her. The only time ive ever experienced that type of fear is when I was in jail for 2 months and for 2 weeks I had a gang member trying to reform in my cell. The worst wasnt even getting the belt or beat, even though that sucked since I basically just had to sit there and take it knowing I could easily do something about it. The worst was the shit she would say and threaten. 

She'd tell us stuff like us being alive ruined her life, she didn't want us, our father tricked her into believing he was impotent. She even threatened to kill us or kill herself several times. Me and brother would just be hanging out and if she came out of the room past 10AM in the robe we knew to go into the basement and chill or leave the house, but even then she'd yell shit, or talk shit about us loud enough for us to hear. She'd throw fits randomly then go to her room and cry asking why? Over and over, and it made me feel pity for her even though it was literally about her not wanting us lol. ""Your father doesnt want you either"" 

It was pretty insane, at that same time I was expected to to well, I excelled academically and my brother not so much. We were pitted against each other constantly by her and him being bigger then me, I end up with alot of stiches. She didnt come home until around 6 or 7 and sometimes not at all. When my brother went to my dad's to live for a while, I was all alone with this insanity. Thats when it really got confusing because i had no one around to confirm how crazy she was being, so alot of the time, no matter how right I knew I was, id end up blaming myself anyway. 

She would say crazy shit, then just go blank trying to bait you, then just look at you and be like ""what?! Get a life, stop acting like a little girl"" or some wild shit like this. 

This whole period of my life and my brothers definitely fucked us up pretty significantly. I cant speak for him, but for me, now that im sober from opiates I realize so much of why I did them in the first place.

Its because no matter where I go in the world, I have this hypervigalence about everything. It kinda lied beneath the surface of however im really feeling. I overthink what im gonna say, and wonder if I even said enough, or could have worded things better. I overanyalze body language and eye contact. I want love but get afraid ill fuck it up and have trouble with silence even if its completely natural. Even when im feeling confident or self assured I constantly question it or try to reaffirm if its geniune or wonder if im being arrogant. 

This shit always surfaces when im sober, and truthfully its probably always there, but when I was on opiates I felt safer. I wasnt obviously, I was literally putting myself in more danger, but I know now why I did it and how I justified it.

It really got bad once I was homeless, it was bad when my father died and 2 months later my mother kicked me out of the house after a fight with her BF at the time and she told me ""i told you if you made me choose between him and you it would be him"" and keep in mind i was sober when this happened. She would let this guy push me around and punch me and told me if I hit him back she'd call the cops and say I hit him first.

It was truly insane, I felt trapped in a situation that just kept getting worse and my father dying made it even crazier becsuse I had no one who truly understand the situation and could get me to see reason. I think subconsciously or maybe even consciously I chose to do opiates to not onlt numb myself while being functional job wise during this insane stress, but also to live up to what was being projected onto me. If im such a burden I might as well make it worth it, and if you need someone to blame, fuck it ill be the scapegoat. At least then I can justify the amount of shit get shoveled down my throat. ""Yea she's hard on me, but i deserve it"" 

I never really got addicted to alcohol and it caused more destruction in my life then any other drug ive done. There's people in NA meeting who will roll their eyes when you bring up this kind of stuff, in my experience its usually old timers, and my best guess would be that it hits home for them. They've probably heard it from their kids and cant stand that its true. I get it, but thats doesnt make it less valid. And personally, in order for me to move past it, I have to admit it and accept it. Really understand where all this pain started. 

And trust me I get it, like I said, my mother grew up in an alcoholic home, as did my father. My father's parents werent abusive though, just slightly neglectful. My mother didnt have that same situation. They could easily say the same thing though, but it wouldnt be false. I used to think ""well we could just go back generationally and blame every generation so whats the point"" but im not looking to subvert blame, just to understand, for me, so i can heal from it and move on. I cant just pretend its all normal and all good. That shit shaped who I am today in the worst way. 

I hope anyone else battling addictions can find the strength to understand the root of their compulsions for control too. Because ultimately thats all addiction is. An urge to control emotions, attached to memories, situations or people that cant be changed, only understood and made peace with. Id argue though that most of us had no idea how to process and handle those emotions or even thought it was possible to when our addictive behaviors began. 

I know when I got serious this time, I told myself, im ready to feel all the pain, no more hiding from it. Let it all flow and in time it will get easier, and so far thats whats been happening. Snapshots of moments I suppressed all my life, probably in an effort to create a memory where that pain was somehow in my control or didnt exist at all. But the thing about life is, all of your life is yours. The good and the bad, doesnt make it your fault or and doesnt mean you need to depend on anyone for the good, it just means you gotta accept it for what it is, cuz like my dad used to say religiously: ""I know you hate to hear this buddy, but It Is What It Is""

I got to work that day without doing any heroin for 8 hours already, feeling like absolute shit. Yawing, sweating, anxiety, and nausea started to set in quick. Did I mention this is my stepdads, dad’s business. So it’s not like I can just go home cause I lived with him and my mom at the time. They both worked there too. I was like 19 at the time. 

    It was a Friday and that was payday so I figured I could bullshit half the day till my hour lunch break, take a drive downtown to my guy and come back. WRONG! We had a $40,000 delivery job to take that required the box truck and not just a pickup truck like normal. Guess who was the only one of the 3 of us who could drive it, ME! :) Also had to load up all the windows and 1x4, 1x6, and 1x12, probably like 20 single windows, 8 doubles, and 2 triples. 

   When I tell you that was the longest drive of my life (1 hour), I almost went off the road just from being so inside my head. Thankfully the 2 guys with me were about my age and they already knew what was up. They didn’t really care, they did let me just hand off all the stuff and they take it into the garage of the customers house. We chilled in the A/C for a hour and by then it was time to go back. Since we didn’t take a lunch, we could sometimes leave work a hour early. So soon as I got back, I gave them the keys and paperwork to turn in and I left at 3:00(closes at 4). Went and got some and got sold some bullshit so had to wait another 2 days till my other guy had some. 😩

   Big boss man wasn’t happy, ended up getting fired and it really sucked. My mom came home pissed and looking back, I don’t blame her. I ended up progressing to fentanyl after for a little while until I OD’d for the first time and then a second time all in 1 week. This was right when Covid hit and heroin was mixed or non existent. So I ended up saying “I want dogfood(H)” knowing it was all fent, just didn’t care at the time and was depressed. 

 16 months sober and never felt better 👍🏻 Never really crave it anymore cause how much destruction it did to my life and health.

They have me on 6th floor in a single room with a view of the city. I'll be here until Monday when they are moving me to a inpatient rehab center. 

This is in San Francisco so I'm just glad I can be in a safe place where I can get sober and not use. Every part of me felt like they were going to be rude and brush me off but thankfully it's the opposite. It's actually something I wish everyone of us would experience in the hospital (which I know isn't the case) because it really turns me towards sobriety so much.",23

I started taking opioids in the beginning of the year, I stopped 6 months in, got clean, relapsed and to try to get rid of the withdrawals by purchasing this weird pill I found at the smoke shop. I took one felt great, and did not have anymore withdrawals, by the time I knew it the bottle was gone and I was back at the smoke shop. I was telling myself I’ll quit tomorrow, this is my last one, but that turned into now…. I’m going everyday, buying at least 2-3 bottles (10 tablets each bottle with 20mg/200 mg in total) 40$ a bottle… since September. I’m deep in, my husband does not know about the issues, nor my addiction.. he’s completely blind sided by it. I feel like a shit wife, and mother. I’m fully functional with it so you can say I’m a functioning addict. I planned on going to the emergency room today so I can finally get off this. I can say, the withdrawal are far WORSE than anything I’ve imagined. I also believe I’ve had medical issues because of it, from RCVS (neurological issues) to vomiting.. my life has completely turned upside down since buying this product. I deeply regret ever touching this… I just wanted to come on here and vent. It’s been hard for me the last couple of months.. no one knows about this secret.. or this habit… I’m living in a shadow, mentally it’s draining and I feel like time is ticking, I’m so into reality that I hate living, I’m addicted to a dopamine high, something in me is missing and I do not know what it is..

I've been addicted for 5 years at this point, and most of the years I used all my savings, until 2 years ago, where I slowly had spent so much of my income that I had to take on loans (BAD loans with a high %) in order to keep working and not get sick.

Fast forward to this day, several of my loans have now gone to the phase where they will take assets from me, I am deeply indebted (which is like 100.000 USD I think, half of which with 20% a year, the other half 5%) and struggle to think positively about this as I am trying to get clean. When I am clean, the burden of this seems so overhwelming that I end up dosing to get away from it, which of course is stupid.

  
But anyway.. I just wanted to hear from other people who maybe found themselves in the same situation as me, how they tackled it or are planning to tackle it.. succes stories too are of course very welcomed.. I think this is one of the main things that makes me want to use again.. but its also one of the reasons I need to stop using 100%. Thank you all, wish you all the best.",29

I’m a 23 y/o female, I’m a wife and a successful small, online business owner. I started oxy and hydro about 8 months ago, when I was working a little part time job and a coworker offered me a perc as I struggle really bad with back pain after a procedure I had done when I was younger. I then started buying them from someone, started doing them only to “feel good” kind of how some people drink alcohol (I don’t drink) then I started using heavier on the daily basis. Not to “feel good” but just to function and not be in WD. My husband also worked out of town and was gone like 5/6 days a week, so I was able to hide my addiction well especially since I have my own income I bought them with. I live in a different state than I was born in, and I don’t have anything to do with my own family as they’re toxic, and I hid my addiction from my in laws. I don’t have many friends, so no one knew or suspected a thing from me as I’ve never struggled with addiction in the past, besides nicotine and caffeine. In the last month, I picked up “blues” which I’m 99% are fent pills. I haven’t tested them, but I just know they’re fent. They’re the same price as regular oxys in my area, and they were a much better “bang for my buck” especially when I got a hot batch (dangerous, I know) but after doing them, oxy or hydro wouldn’t even fase me or get me out of WD. Only blues, so that became my DOC that I used HEAVILY. Well, a few weeks ago my husband came back home as he had an amazing job opportunity in our town, and him being back made it pretty hard to go meet my 🔌 , especially since my 🔌 was absolutely awful to get in touch with and often made me wait HOURS, which always put me in WD especially if I had ran out already. This led to me being “sick” every damn day. I’d wake up multiple times throughout the night withdrawaling, and had to lay in bed some days because I couldn’t move until I got my fix. My husband is ex law enforcement and also a recovered addict who has been sober for 7 years (very proud of him). I am a person who has a few health issues anyway, so he just thought it was my issues causing me to me so sick, although once I came clean about everything, he did say that he suspected it a tiny bit, but did not want to think that because he’s never had a reason to.

I tried to quit cold turkey a few times over the last few weeks, and I ended up in absolute hell, and lapsed every time. Okay, fast forward to Monday evening, 08/9/2025 I attempted to cold turkey yet again, but I was somewhat more hopeful than I had been for the last few attempts. I was in a bad mental state, but so ready to get out because this addiction has taken so much from me that I wanted to grow some lady balls and get through it. My husband cold turkey’d meth, pills, and other things and I remembered his story, so I thought I could do the same…

TW: blood, self harm, pregnancy loss, withdrawal 

I constantly vomited up bile for 18/20 hours, until it turned to just blood. In my withdrawals, vomiting, cold sweating, leg pain/RLS, anxiety, ect were my normal symptoms, but this time it was 100 times worse and I had different symptoms including the mental and full body convulsions, my eyes would roll into the back of my head and I’d hyperventilate. I take buspar for anxiety, have been on it for years, but I wasn’t able to keep anything down so I threw up my medicine although he gave it to me multiple times so I could get it in me. I suspect I was WD’ing from that as well. Then, as time went on I started having more intense psychological, symptoms that I’ve never experienced before. I am a person that struggles with anxiety and depression, but this was some serious dark hell that I went through and I’m wanting to know has anyone else ever experienced this. I only know this because he told me and he took some videos for me to see when I came to. I started to harm myself, I pulled out so much of my hair, banged my head against hard surfaces to try and bust my head open, I attacked my husband when he was giving me a bath and I scratched/bit/fought, I screamed for so many hours until I lost my voice, and at some point on Tuesday, I asked him to take me to the ER. He had wanted to take me all along, but I refused out of shame for what was really happening. I only remember bits and pieces up until this point then it went even blacker. I remember getting to the ER, the nurses getting me into a room and me begging them for help and getting my meds in my IV (I’m deathly afraid of needles so the IV absolutely disgusted me, especially since my veins were in such bad condition from dehydration). They gave me adavan, saline drips and some zofran. A lady from the detox program came in and spoke with me, and once I got more stable I talked to her more. I had an option of 5 days in detox, with no communication or visitors (I completely understand why) but my business is very important to me, I sell and grow rare, exotic houseplants that require very strict care. I don’t have anyone that could do it for me, if I would’ve been able to FaceTime my husband and tell him how to do it when they needed it then I would’ve, but that was against the rules. So I knew I’d possibly be facing thousands of dollars in losses, as crazy as it may seem.. so I opted for a different route and if I couldn’t do it on my own, then I’d go to detox and have my stuff in order before I left. The other option I had was the ER doctor give me some more adavan and send me in a 3 day supply of suboxon the following morning since the ER didn’t have any on the floor, so I’d have to wait. So I did. my husband said as the night went on, I begged the nurses to k!ll me, and eventually I started hallucinating and I thought our dogs and reptiles were in the hospital room. He said I talked to them for about 30 minutes then I dozed off. He said I kept waking up and doing that, then something worse even happened. I started “my period” when I in the hospital, since I bled and threw up all over my clothes, they put me a gown on until he was able to leave and go get me clean clothes from home. The doctor noticed some very large blood clots and asked about my period. My period has been very irregular lately, and I had no pregnancy symptoms at all. Once the doctor noticed that, he started checking me out *per my husband, I do not remember any of this*. I had an adult diaper on at this point, and in my diaper was a 9/10 week fetus I passed  and some of the tissue. I literally miscarried when I was going through hell, had no idea, and I do not remember seeing it or hearing about that.

Then, they discharged me, my husband brought me home and he said I was still in a schizophrenic rage even after the adavan, and when he got me home he helped me get a bath, try and water and my buspar in me and put a period pad on. He said when he started to tell me what had happened, I broke down screaming, crying, and threw my diaper/pad I had on against our white bathroom wall. And I did, because when I woke up the next morning, it looked like someone was murdered in our bathroom. I’ve never done anything like that in my life and I do not remember any of it. 

Fast forward to Thursday, I had to travel two hours to a clinic that proscribed me suboxon. I did not want to start subs, but I feel as if they’re my best chance to get sober as I’ve done my research and I will be tapering off. I have to go to my clinic every week, and I start with a local addiction and mental health counselor next week, because I have some deep, dark demons that have to be addressed especially after losing our baby. I have to find a way to cope with my sadness, differently than I have been. 

As of right now, I don’t feel great. My energy is low, I’m not sleeping well, but my mind is clearer than it has been being. Since I’ve lost so much blood and got so dehydrated, I’ve been eating plenty of nutritious foods, plenty of electrolytes and water and trying to spend more time doing the things I use to enjoy. 


I hid my addiction for so long because I was too ashamed to ask for help from my husband or in-laws or be honest with my husband about it, from pure shame. My parents would be so mean to me anytime I came to them with any issue, so I kind of carried that trauma with me. Not saying lying and hiding things is ok! I take full responsibility for that. I’ve taken accountability for it all, I’ve apologized to everyone I’ve hurt, especially my husband. And I’m so incredibly grateful that he has been so helpful to me. He helped me bathe when I couldn’t stand, he never hurt me when I was raging out, he makes sure I take my subs the way as directed by my doctor, ect. I’m extremely blessed, and I guess I truly had to hit ROCK BOTTOM to finally get the help I needed and I’m so ready to be fully sober in the future. That experience traumatized me so badly, that I truly don’t even want to think about using again.

If anyone reads my full post, thank you. Thank you for listening to me, and if you’re struggling right now, please don’t hesitate to get help. You deserve to get out💚",19

I don’t think I can deal with crippling anxiety on top of everything else and expect to move forward and recover this way in the next few weeks. As soon as I start to feel a little hungry again the anxiety comes on even stronger. 

I had an anxiety disorder for four years after going through benzo withdrawal. I just don’t want to drag my body through that again even if it’s only for a fraction of the time. I just don’t think I have the strength to do it again.

Yeah, you're not like everyone else are you? I mean how could you be, you're a chronic migraine sufferer, the most normal thing to do is to seek relief.
But that's not it, is it? Because the pain relief was never enough. You need the nod. You want to completely melt into your bed, to be in the state of existence without feeling or fearing. And it's fun, it always is the first few days. Then your tolerance goes up, because of course it does. And it's fine, you'll just do 30mg today. No biggie.
Suddenly you're doing 120mg a day, throwing up half the stuff you eat and unable to stop. And I did stop. Thats the dumbest part. I had recovered and almost forgotten that somewhere in this house is the rest of my grandma's stash. Until I confessed to my mom, and she let the location slip. For 2 months I've been back on them and man, I don't even like the feeling 90% of the time. But I couldn't drink, it's so boring and also lead to me being sick.

I visited my mom Sunday, I have done days without Oxys, it'll be fine. Worst case scenario I would pop two or three and move on. That's not what happened. 
You see, in my naivety I was convinced I am too smart to go through withdrawals that are this bad. It started with one big throw up, Sunday night. Then the sweating began. I vomited bile for a whole day, went to the ER to get an IV for nausea and hydration. I was cramping up and slurring my words. The vomiting continued last night, a night I spent in sleepless agony, throwing up until my lips were bloody and my esophagus felt like a rock. I went to my doctor today, made up some bullshit about chinese food I had Sunday and how it's probably food poisoning. It's probably not. I'm just too embarrassed to admit that I went back on Oxys after all this time.

You NEVER wanna feel like this again. Two IV's and I'm still fighting to keep down sips of watered down gatorade. Oxy's don't make you happy, they make you sleepy. They numb the pain and depression, but so does weed, and that would never do you like this. Just stick to smoking, you stupid bitch. 

I'm not sure if taking Oxy now would help at all with the process, I'm tempted, but ultimately just enjoying not puking every 20 minutes. My head is splitting in half and my stomach feels like a warzone. But I think the worst is behind me now, at least I hope so.

Attenuation of opioid withdrawal with high dose ascorbic acid

What's up guys? Long time no see! I have stumbled upon some information that is so profound that I had to come back and visit you guys and share it with you. Please don't be afraid to give this a try and leave a comment about your results and also share with others you know who may benefit from it.

When you know that you are about to run out of your opioid of choice you need to start mega-dosing ascorbic acid (vitamin c). The studies I am going to link at the end suggest taking 300mg/kg, but we have better forms of this compound available now and I have gotten the dose down to approximately 155mg/kg by taking liposomal vitamin c instead of just the regular ascorbic acid vitamin c. This works because liposomal vitamin c's oral bioavailability is 1.77 times greater than regular oral vitamin c.

I am not joking one bit when I tell you that **taking the dose I recommended above will relieve 80-90% of the withdrawal symptoms from a serious fucking fentanyl habit.** If you don't know what I mean by the mg/kg part I will break it down: if you weigh 170 pounds you need to convert that to kilograms (kg) by dividing by 2.2, which gives us ~77.3kg. You then multiply the dose of the liposomal vitamin c (155mg) by your body weight in kg (~77.3) giving you about 12,000mg. Yes, I know, 12,000mg sounds crazy, but it's not really considering one tablet of what I am going to link contains 1650mg. 

You can buy 297,000mg (29g) of liposomal vitamin c from Walmart for $21, which works out to less than $1 a day to feel significantly better. This method is absolutely fucking amazing to use if you are actually trying to detox because vitamin c does not prolong the suffering because it is not an opioid, it just masks a very large chunk of the shitty ass withdrawal symptoms.

I will also add that I did take therapeutic doses of loperamide when I used this method to come off my fent habit. I was able to eat, sleep, and even go to work (pretty much fucked off because this still isn't a magic bullet) all because of the liposomal vitamin c.

Alright, enough from me. Here are some sources:

**Here are some peer reviewed studies on this topic and a brief TL;DR**

*1. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10836211

TLDR: Heroin addicts as patients Control group treated with conventional meds (no vit C) experienced major withdrawal in 56.6% of patients. Vitamin C group experienced major withdrawal in 10-16.6% some bias in this study however if you read into it

*2. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7572147/

TLDR: High, frequent doses of AA may also abort cravings and opioid withdrawal symptoms in those with OUD and has better tolerability than other OUD treatments.

*3. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2852062/

TLDR: Rats addicted to morphine and then put into precipitated WD with naloxone showed far less 'escape jumps and tail flicks' (sort of like RLS) when they were treated with high dose Ascorbic Acid

*4. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6686637

TLDR: In mice: vit C, when co-administered with morphine, suppresses the development of tolerance and physical dependence on the drug

*5. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5107231/

TLDR: 97 patients, half given high dose 50 mg/kg vitamin C, the other half placebo. Both groups given morphine before operation. 2 hours after surgery the VitC group self administered significantly lower morphine consumption and reported LOWER pain after 24 hours than the placebo group (only morphine group)

*6. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4183085/

TLDR: Complex study on mice basically proving VitC had a profound effect when combined with Tramadol or Morphine

*7. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25250292

TLDR: Rats had operation to fix a cannula to their vein, then subjected to 12 days of self-administration of morphine for 12 days, if rats received high dose of VitC before self-admin, they used less morphine, also, rats injected with higher doses of VitC showed significantly less symptoms after naloxone induced precipitated WD. (check out the images at the bottom of the study, very interesting)

*8. http://whale.to/v/c/stone.html

TLDR: Pilot study called *The Hypoascorbemia-Kwashiorkor Approach to Drug Addiction Therapy.* Gives more information and case studies using high dose sodium ascorbate with other vitamins and minerals.


Hopefully this will help a few people, I sure as fuck know it helped me!

I wasn't supposed to live long and was in tremendous pain so dependency and addiction wasn't an issue but I ended fighting cancer for around 11 years. Been found to have no evidence of disease. They don't like to say remission. 
Cancer took everything from me. Feels almost like having all those years taken from me. I was newly married and owned a very successful restaurant with my wife. She was by my side for 13 years before we got married. We had so many adventures, truly living a life I could only dream of. 
Then at 36 I was diagnosed with stage 4 melanoma. It was my wife that made the appointment. I had zero symptoms and now  facing death within months. She stayed with me at the beginning, surgeries and chemo, and then something changed. She moved out while I was in the hospital and served me with divorce papers. I was dieing and she left me. You want to talk about destroyed. The mountain I was facing, I was now doing alone. She abandoned me at the worst part of my life. I don't know how you can do that to someone. 
The surgeries and chemo were brutal, cancer was spreading rapidly to my stomach, intestines, lungs and liver. 
I was in the hospital allot and the restaurant closed down. She abandoned that too.  
Anyway.i honestly don't know if it was a subconscious defense mechanism or what it was. She was remarried and pregnant and I was alone.I lost everything but somehow the weeks turned into years. I've been fighting this for 11 years, lots of MRI, CT and PET scans and years of chemo and immunotherapy and I made through that hell just to be faced with this mother fucker of an opponent.
 I've taken thousands of pain pills being prescribed around 500 pills per month. 10 mg oxy, 8 mg Dilaudid, 30 mg morphine and fentanyl patches for 11 years now. I needed every one of those too. The pain was undescribable. Hundreds of staples and stitches, so many surgeries.
So here I am on my second day and this is up there with the level of discomfort I'm in right now and I've done some painful things. 
I'm done with it but damn I'm alone and would love to communicate with someone with some encouragement or something. Life has beaten me down so much. I don't trust easily. Been years and I still miss her. Don't know if I'll ever get over it. 
Anyway I know I'm all over the place but I'm hurtin. I refuse to believe that I don't have more to do. More to accomplish and maybe even find love again. I guess I'm starting to get the emotional part of withdrawal. Just started so who knows. ",85
179,1jay789,Beating opioids/long post,[deleted],22,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1jay789/beating_opioidslong_post/,"Hi guys

I just thought I would give my story with my battle with opioids  to see if I can help any people.

I started using heroin at the age of 17, to be honest I know it sounds weird but I didn’t even know what it was. I’m from the UK and was heavily into the 90s rave scene, using Molly, speed, ket but only on the weekends  when I was going to allnight rave parties. I would smoke  weed every night though. 

One particular night  I saw one of my friends smoking something off some foil but wasn’t sure what it was and they just said it was something to help them sleep from the come down and called it Brown, bear in mind no Internet then no social media . I decided to try some and thought the taste was disgusting but it immediately brought me down and it helped me sleep

This would continue for some time, just doing it on the weekends still unaware. 

Then I noticed I would do it on a Tuesday and then on a Thursday, put a long story short before I knew it I was almost doing it every day and then one day I woke up And I felt really anxious stomach cramps sweating and almost felt like I was speeding, eyes like golf balls. 

I was at work when this happened and my older friend I told him and he asked me if I’d been using heroin I said I’ve been using something called Brown. He said take this and if you feel better you need to get help,obviously that was methadone. 20 minutes later I felt immediately normal and knew it’s gotten its rotten claws into me. 

From then 17  till 24 it was a downward spiral I lost everything pretty much but luckily my mum and dad still supported me although they did kick me out at one stage. 

I was doing H , crack, benzos sometimes together and surprised I’m not dead. I was also using iv :(

4  failed rehab attempts, then my mother researched a place called detox five where basically they knock you out for five days so supposedly you get over the easiest part of the withdrawal. 

So I went there and did the protocol, like an idiot I never told them I had a benzo tolerance so I actually woke up on day two and I had to give me double the dose. 

I woke up on day five feeling obviously very tired and relaxed from the benzos thinking yeah that’s it. I did not  know  Mr withdrawal was doing push-ups in the corner waiting to smack the crap out of me as soon as I got home and boy it did. 

I literally had zero sleep for around three weeks, rls for a long time and crazily dilated pupils for a long time and  severe anxiety with no appetite or energy.   

I had no friends because they were all users and I literally felt at the age of 24 my life was over and I’ve lost my best friend, there was no information about doing protocols like taking supplements to ease things/vit c protocol and increased dopamine levels it was fucking brutal. 

But as each week/month past I started sleeping that tiny little bit more and getting my energy back. It took  me around almost 9 months to feel somewhat normal regarding the physical symptoms

Then one day I watched a movie called American Psycho, that was the day where I got motivated to go and try and change myself not because he was a psychopath ha ha it was because of his workout routine and the way he looked after himself I know it’s only a movie but still

That day me and my counsellor went to the gym and I got kind of hooked ever since on that, got talking to different people and after around four months a guy got me to do a triathlon with him which I kind of fell in love with. 

One year after that I was competing in ironman triathlons, two years after that I qualified for the world championship. but I’m kind of an extreme person but basically that’s where I was getting my dopamine from and that’s what I got addicted to

My life would continue like this competing in different sports until 38 years of age until my father died and then literally one week after I found out my wife of 10 years had been cheating on me.

So I did not want to be in the same house as her and moved out to a new area with all my belongings. One particular day I really hurt my back in the gym and I had boxes and boxes of codeine p 30 mg. These are from the previous injury but I just kept on collecting them from the pharmacy but not even taking them just collecting them. 

I popped 3  that day and roughly 30 minutes later I was like oh God this feels so nice and it made all the pain I was going through at the time go away and you probably know what’s coming next I got addicted to codeine. 

Of course they  are a different beast to H, fent/oxy

So I will get addicted to codeine from 2016 until 2018. Then in 2019 I lost my brother to cancer and started using codeine again 

Then I quit the codeine again in mid 2020 and I’ve been clean from opioid since. 

Any opioids are a fucking evil drug and some Doctors it seems to me actually want to get you on them I don’t know whether they get commission or something

I’m not sure if my post will help anyone who is trying to quit but my point is if you are trying to quit be kind to yourself in your withdrawal phase and when you’re feeling better find something that you’re passionate about there’s got to be something you’re passionate about. 

Whether it’s working out, hiking , cooking, computers, video games or whatever else

My problem is also I have ADHD so I do get addicted to things quite easily but now I just have to make sure that they’re positive things i  get addicted to

I’m assuming many posts have been written like this on this sub.   I just thought I would share my story to see if it can help motivate anyone

180,1iyzir2,1 month clean,[deleted],23,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1iyzir2/1_month_clean/,"I have one month clean from all opiates/opioids today 😀 I have NEVER been able to accomplish this amount of clean time without MAT or incarceration. I've also realized something. Every other time I've ever gotten clean, I always knew in the back of my head that I was just resting up for a while. I never told myself ""We're never doing this again."" I'm actually scared this time, and making choices that I never have. I'm trying to be as proactive as I can. I've done this for about 15 years on and off and I think I'm finally tired enough to figure out a solution. I really feel like the street fent scared the shit out of me. This was also the first relapse where I stopped MYSELF. No family intervention. No incarceration. I woke up and I was disgusted with myself. Pretty much all of my physical symptoms have subsided. Now, I'm just grappling with the anxiety and very little sleep. In spite of that, I'm extremely grateful to be alive & clean today. I did some thinking earlier about what is different this time so that I could tell others. I came up with this: This is the first time that I decided to tell myself I'm strong enough to do this instead of telling myself I'm weak. Historically, my will power has ALWAYS been for shit. I guess my point is the shit that we say to ourselves matters A LOT more than the shit other people say to us sometimes. I've always had a good support system of people who love me and believe that I can do it. I never believed I could do it. I believe it now. I just want to say to the people still using or in acutes that you can do it. It feels like it will never pass, but it does. Things get better everyday. Please dont let that wicked voice in your head tell you that it's all for naught. You DESERVE to reclaim your life. ",13

I prayed and prayed for months for God to get me off this medicine because I knew I could never do this on my own. Weaning wasn’t an option because we know we have it so we take it the first sign of uncomfortableness. So this is what happened. The pharmacies I was getting my rx filled from no longer would fill them because the doctor got red flagged. Okay so I found a different place that had the exact one I took. Guess what happened next, the doctor was no longer able to fill narcotics for not just me but for anyone else. Now I don’t know how spiritual some of you are BUT I truly believe that God heard all my prayers and he crashed everything around me so I could no LONGER HAVE ACCESS to that medication. So I had no other choice but to withdrawal and do it cold turkey. I am 4 days in and I’m still struggling with the restless legs and arms and also the hot/cold sweats. On my 2nd day I went to the ER for help because I could no longer bear those electrical shocks throughout my body after nearly 48 hours. That hospital told me “all I can offer you is a bag of fluids” I wanted to jump off that bed and ring his throat. Instead I took the bag of floods and drove home. I fell asleep on the freeway and the only reason I didn’t crash out was from the rumble strips waking me up. I had laid in my living room floor the 2 days prior in agony so my body was exhausted to say the least. I’m grateful and I’m thankful for this deliverance. I’m almost 40 and I want to live a pure life. I know I had to go through this and feel every bit of this so that I would never ever go back. Anyone out there wondering if you are strong enough to do it, the answer is yes!!!! I’m a mom of 3 young kids and not a single soul knew of my oxy use. Each day we wake up we are a little better. You can do this, but only if you’re truly ready too. You have to face it one day. ",43
184,1ml6w8t,Wired shut,Cool_Grass1029,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1ml6w8t/wired_shut/,"Untitled - Anonymous Recovery Story

I was 17. Still on foot, no car. That was safer — easier to run, to disappear when needed. Supposed to re-up that day. Some so-called friends walked up, acting like they were gonna dap me up. Next thing I know, black.

I wake up on the ground, someone’s kicking me in the ribs, another’s digging in my pockets. I couldn’t feel much at first. I didn’t know my mouth was literally hanging open. They took my phone, my cash, whatever I had. I got to my side chick’s house somehow — told her to get me to the hospital.

First hospital didn’t care. No insurance? Not their problem. They said they couldn’t do the surgery there, wanted to send me by ambulance to another state. All I could think was, “That ambulance ride’s gonna cost more than I can hold.” I had a family member drive me instead — against medical orders. Doc handed me a bottle of pills and said, “This’ll get you through.”

I didn’t cry. I think I was still in shock. Maybe just used to pain by then.

Made it to the other hospital. Some doc took the case pro bono. They put me under and wired my jaw shut. Ribs broken, body full of weird fluid pockets. Couldn’t move without pain — especially this burning feeling down my neck and ears. I knew something was wrong.

They sent me home with 10mg hydros. After the surgery: liquid Percocet, 10mg per 5mL. Gave me a 5 oz bottle — I could refill it three times. But every time it wore off, the pain hit like a wildfire in my head. I read the discharge paperwork: “possible nerve damage.”

I went back. Brought the meds with me to prove I wasn’t drug seeking. I didn’t want the pills — I wanted the pain fixed. Instead, the doc walked in, hit me with a needle, and upped my dose.

That’s how it started.

Six months in, I realized I was thinking more about the pills than the pain. My jaw was healing. I could walk. I could breathe. But I didn’t want to stop. I needed them. Not just for pain anymore — for life.

And I had connections. I was already working and selling. I knew older cats who loved coke more than pills. So I’d grab an 8-ball for cheap, sell it off piece by piece, and stack pills as profit. Wholesale perks, retail coke. Simple math. Take a couple to keep myself moving. Morning, lunch, after work. Nighttime was the heavy part.

I started telling myself I was doing it for the money, for the hustle. But I was losing control.

My wife — she noticed things I didn’t. Shallow breathing. Slowed heart rate. I’d stop breathing in my sleep. She’d shake me awake, terrified.

I told her to relax. Told her if she liked the life — the house, the bags, the cars — then I needed to do me.

She looked me dead in the face and said, “I don’t want you to die in your sleep. I need you.”

I’ll never forget those words. Still brings tears. That moment was the clarity. Everything clicked.

I gave my phone to my boy, told him to hold it down, keep people from showing up looking for a fix. Took time off work. Locked myself in.

Day 1 wasn’t too bad… until hour 14. Shaking. Sweating. Couldn’t sleep. Couldn’t sit still. Seizure hit. People told me to go to the hospital. I said, “F**k them.” I wasn’t giving them the satisfaction. I knew if I stepped foot in there again, they’d slap a label on me: “addict.” And I’d never get taken seriously again.

Day 2 was worse. Piss, shit, sweat, vomit — all at once. Felt like my body was on fire. Couldn’t keep water down. Muscles locked up so bad I couldn’t even stretch without cramping. Couldn’t eat. Couldn’t walk.

Day 3, I was still in the shower, curled up, water turned cold. My body was rejecting life. My mind? It was on constant defense. Thinking. Planning. What if someone comes? What if I break?

Day 4, I managed a banana. An apple. Maybe some bread. Still wanted it, but I could stand. Could walk. Wasn’t convulsing.

Day 5, I had pride again. I didn’t win the war, but I survived the worst battle.

And even now — years later — I still twitch. Still get spasms in my sleep. Maybe it’s nerve damage. Maybe it’s just what happens after you put your body through hell.

But I’m here.

And I’m clean.

Not because I’m strong.
But because someone loved me enough to say, “I need you.”

And because I finally believed them.",2

To Anyone Out There Struggling With Opiates:

I see you. I know the war you’re fighting — not just against the drug, but against the guilt, the shame, the grief, and the lies your mind tells you when you’re at your lowest. I’ve been there. I know what it’s like to feel broken, like you’re too far gone, like the damage is too deep to ever come back from.

But here’s the truth — you can live again. You can build a life in recovery that is stronger, richer, and more meaningful than anything you ever imagined. And not only that — you deserve that life.

Recovery isn’t easy. It’s messy, painful, and raw at times. But it’s also beautiful. It's waking up without chains. It’s laughing again. It’s rebuilding trust. It’s finally looking in the mirror and seeing someone worth fighting for. I’m not just speaking as someone who hopes it’s possible — I’m speaking as someone who knows it is. I'm living proof.

If you're in the middle of the storm, if you're barely hanging on, please hear me: you’re not alone. You’re not weak for struggling. And you’re not beyond saving. Recovery is not about being perfect — it’s about being willing. Willing to try again. Willing to reach out. Willing to believe, even if it’s just a little bit at first.

If you ever need someone to talk to, someone who gets it without judgment — I’m here. Reach out. I don’t care if we’ve never met. I’ll listen. I’ll be that hand reaching back when you’re slipping.

We do recover. One day, one choice, one breath at a time.

With love and respect,
S....

Need help pls,pinkestman,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1jhd5r7/how_can_i_quit_this_drug_use_cycle_need_help_pls/,"I never had big ambitions. Growing up, I floated through life, unsure of what I wanted. In my teens my social anxiety kinda stared to ruine my life, so trying to find a solution i started using stimulants and other drugs two years ago. At first, they were perfect .They gave me confidence, improved my depression, and even made me a bit ambitious. I wasn’t addicted to them at least it didnt feel like i was. 

Back then, my drug use wasn't that bad and manageable. I’d use substances occasionally, using them for productivity mostly. But over the months i tried more and more and it keept getting more regular. Until now where my use is often multiple substances daily.

Then I found nitazenes. Normal opioids weren’t pleasurable for me, I tried everything over time it wasn't no more about productivity more about escaping from who i am. I even tried to shooting up heroin but really only nitazenes did it for me. They erased everything. No anxiety, no loneliness, no thought about my future. I didn’t care that my life was stagnant or that I was destroying myself. For two months, I used them daily, chasing that void. I nearly overdosed and felt nothing no fear, no regret. I didn't really saw the problem in dying unexpectedly peacefully.

Three weeks ago, I quit opioids mainly becaue i ran out. But now I’m worse off than ever. My mind is hollowed out. Without stimulants, I’m paralyzed. I’ll lie in bed for hours, unable to do anything really. Simple tasks, feel impossible. I got into stimulants again just to survive, but they don’t work nearly as effective anymore, almost just to feel normal i have to take them. I can take meth and continue to lay in my bed without any motivation for anything. No joy, no motivation, just mechanical existence.  
I can't quit drugs, If I do if feel like I'm going to lose my job and fail school. But I also can't continue doing what I do otherwise my liver is going to fail on me with only 20 years old.

Opioids broke something in me. They made me numb to how broken I was, and now even though I’m off them, I still feel numb to my nosy of my problems. My liver’s still a concern, but that’s not what scares me. It’s the psychological problems, that I can’t get anything done, can’t feel anything well except anxiety, unless I’m high. 

I know I should give myself time to recover, but I really don't know how people are able to get off drugs for more than a year. I keep thinking about opioids even tho they fucked me up. And even if I never touch them I'm still stuck in a loop to fix the consequences from drug use with more drug use. Has had anyone similar experiences? I would be really thankful for useful comments!
Thanks for reading : )

Edit: Sorry if I didn't reply to everyone, but thanks so much for your comments they mean a lot to me. In real life, people only look down to you. And don't understand that it isn't as simple like as they think it is. Since I'm a loner talking about feelings, I can't tell anyone feels great.",37

Sharing my story gave me a chance to show what addiction looks like up close. I discussed how living on the streets in Philadelphia affected me and how I lost both feet in 2025 due to complications from my addiction.

The video focuses on hope and resilience. Recovery changed my life. I found a new sense of purpose and started advocating for others facing similar struggles. I want to break the stigma around addiction and support others in their journey to get better.

My goal is to reach anyone who feels alone or is struggling. You are not alone, and there is support out there. If you have any questions about my journey or the video, I am open to sharing more.

Stay strong. There is a way forward.

I am new to Reddit. Today I have been sober from fent (and all other substances) for exactly one year. I was a real hopeless case, physically couldn’t recognize myself, mentally broken, and emotionally unhinged. I hated myself and pitied myself but somehow also thought I was better and smarter than everyone else. I thought I was invincible because no matter how much I tried I just couldn’t seem to die. I did at least one terrible thing every day to get what I needed. Never in a million years thought I could get better. 

I am sharing this to let anybody stuck in it know that it is possible. It did not happen in one day but the self pity is gone, the shame and guilt is gone, I have a relationship with my family and friends and MYSELF that I didn’t think was achievable. The single most important thing I did was start listening to other people who have been through this and made it out the other side. I think back and I was always “willing to do anything” to get out of hell until someone suggested something even mildly uncomfortable or unfamiliar. This time I tried actually doing all the things people had been saying might help me for years. Wouldn’t you know, all that stuff helped. Detox sucked but it helped, rehab helped, therapy helped, meds helped, recovery programs helped. 

I used to make excuses for why I couldn’t afford to do that stuff or why it wouldn’t work for me. Frankly, the only real reason i had not to try ANYTHING was that I wasn’t ready to change. As soon as I admitted that I didn’t know what I was doing, I’m not smarter than everybody else, as soon as I started letting others help me, everything got much better very, very fast. I am even kind of grateful for everything I went through because it has given me an incredible appreciation for life. I know different people get sober differently but I can only share what worked for me. Please feel free to ask me anything or DM me if you are going through it. ",11

What’s the 1 or 2 things that gets you through the day or the week? That shit that you can’t live without, that keeps you sane. Could be a person, an activity, whatever. 

For me, it’s these 20-30 mins I get to sit alone in my truck and blast some music. Most likely singing along poorly. 

Or just as great if not better, when I take my boat out with my friends. One of whom is 18 months sober as well. We ride around, listen to music and sing and dance like fools. Watch the sunset, swim, etc. 

One of the things I’m the most grateful for being sober… how fuckin great music sounds. I had gotten to the point I couldn’t get that hair standing on end feeling and I had stopped listening.

I helped my GF on her workplace today for 3 hours. Now she wants me to help her again next morning and I see it as a way to pass time and force myself to do stuff. I cant imagine if I can perform with 2 days without sleep though.

The diarrhea got way better. I went maybe only 5 times to the Toilet today before that it was easily 15-20 times.
Cold flashes still come but I realized I drank too much coffee it made me anxious. I will Stick to one coffee in the morning and if i need more i will drink Black tea.
My RLS is just mild rn.
But im just not tired. Helping with sleep on day 5 to 6 with the lyrica and on the first to the second day maybe wasnt as smart.
So still no comfort meds I need to feel the pain.
I smoked some weed to burn some time today though and because of being awake for a day I really got high high and Forgot about withdrawals at least for 1 hour after the first joint.

I’m hyped to share that I’ve been clean from opiates for exactly one month today! It’s been a tough journey, but I’m still standing, and I’m proud. I take Diazepam sometimes to sleep or Clonidin to take the edge off, but the physical withdrawal is mostly gone. Now it’s the mental fight that’s real. My head’s a bit of a mess sometimes, like pure chaos in there, but I’m trying hard to stay calm, whether I’m sitting or standing, and not let it show.
I’ve been smashing it with sports more than ever. Last week, I was on Rügen, this awesome island in Germany, and me and my mates cycled 105km around it, even with withdrawal symptoms trying to drag me down. I never knew I was this strong, but I’m learning I am, and I truly feel God’s on my side, guiding me through.
Big thanks to this community! Your posts, recommendations, and tips are a lifeline and keep me focused. I’m struggling with the psychological stuff, though, anyone got tips for dealing with the mental chaos? Any tricks to stay grounded when your mind’s all over the place?
You guys are incredible, and I’m so grateful for all the support. God bless you all, and thanks for being part of my journey!",4

But my husband has. He's 2 years and 3 months clean. It's been a hard, sometimes painful journey but full of lots of growth. 

I thought I would share somethings I've noticed 2 years into this. 

He continues to work SO hard on himself. He's in therapy every other week. He stays in touch with others in recovery. Makes a point about hitting the gym as much as he can (sometimes that's 4 days a week and sometimes once a week.) 

The other day, he didn't get paid on time for a gig he did on the weekend. He was rightfully annoyed with the company (partly because he had to ask why he hadn't been paid yet instead of them notifying him of the issue.) But he also told me he felt a little emotionally triggered from it and it was linked to feelings from his addiction.  Basically, he was in such debt during his addiction, that being paid late would be catestrophic. But present day, it was fine. Annoying and unprofessional but we are okay. 

But recognizing that, I think is so huge. There are tons of little moments like that. They make me so proud of him. He's really putting in the work and it's inspiring, just as humans. ",7

I enjoyed a movie today. I thoroughly enjoyed sex last night. I've been exercising and closely monitoring what I'm putting into my body. I also quit caffeine and vaping the day i quit fent because I knew those two things would just exacerbate the anxiety. Obviously, I still feel like something is missing. I know from past experience that takes a while to go away. In spite of all the good, I was slightly triggered today because I received a pretty hefty sum of money (tax return).

Instead of asking you how long this will last… I’m asking what are the benefits of quitting? How did you see your life change positively? How did you feel once you got through it? Did you feel healthy again? Did your thoughts change? My hope and prayer is that once I get through the gnarly withdrawals that I’ll stop nodding off throughout the day and have a constant need to “nap”. I hope I’ll have less mood swings as well, because I def get opiate rage.

230,1i3pcgc,5 months. ,fuckyouyaslut,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1i3pcgc/5_months/,"I made it 5 months and 1 week today. Last December I OD’d for the first time after my first time using after a 3 month clean streak. It was also my first time ever falling out in almost a decade of using. Then a few months after that I passed out in public because I was so weak in withdrawal, that I split my face open on the sidewalk and got 12 stitches. Then a few months after that, I got clean for the billionth time (this time). 

This is the first time I’ve ever made it this far. I use Kratom to keep myself from slipping up, but lately even that feels like a cheat of some kind. Which seems ridiculous because the last few years have been hell trying to get myself off fent. So I’m trying to remind myself that I’m in a better place now. It’s not even a comparison. But I guess it’s a good sign that I feel this way right? 

I’m just not trying to get too over confident about any aspect of my substance abuse because I realize it only takes one fuck up to fuck up again. 

My life feels quiet and calm and stable for the first time and I’m grateful that it is. I’m working a lot and finding happiness in things I thought I wouldn’t give 2 shits about. Like people. And food. And activities I thought were “meaningless”, because I wasn’t getting high. I used to have to scrounge $100 daily before food, rent, any part of life. Just to get me through my day. Just to not get sick. I just couldn’t live my life like that anymore. 

I hope you guys are okay and I truly hope all of you in the middle of it right now are trying to take care of yourselves. <333",12
231,1huadmh,Day 500!,Deathofme_0,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1huadmh/day_500/,"Just hit 500 days sober today! The holidays are always a bit tough for me (since I’d always ruin them with my addiction in the past) but I’m proud of myself for getting through and happy to still be on my recovery journey after 15 years of addiction.

I’m also 80 days sober from weed which is another thing I thought would never happen. It’s funny, while opiates and weed are totally different (I have a medical card), the mindset is similar. On both drugs I thought I could never be sober, I would be awkward or people wouldn’t like me, I wouldn’t be able to survive really without them…but less than 2 weeks after stopping both; I realized the exact opposite is true. I find myself more present than ever, I feel less awkward in social situations, I’m saving even more money; and I’ve been progressing in EMDR therapy like crazy since stopping weed.

I was using weed to help stop my horrible nightmare/night terrors. While it was a good crutch, I got to a point in therapy where I felt stuck basically. I stopped smoking (only because I was trying to get a new job) and found myself making leaps and bounds in therapy I never thought possible. My therapist noticed almost immediately too! Even though I only stopped smoking for the job, I’ve decided to not start back up again! While therapy is still incredibly hard and I have a long way to go, I have made it SO far and I can’t wait to look back in another 500 days and see the results!

This year, my goal is to find an in person meeting that I can be apart of. I have been completely shocked to find how much solidarity and being around likeminded people helps me. I’ve always been someone who’s never really wanted to go, but lately I feel the need for support and want to capitalize on those feelings.

I hope anyone still in the throws of addiction that sees this, knows it’s really possible to get out, you just have to be ready! There are so many resources out there, and I’m always here and happy to help any/everyone I can. I thought I was alone, I could never be helped, and I was better off dead; but I was so wrong. 

And to my friends that are in recovery, keep fighting the good fight! I don’t post in here often these days, but I’m in here almost daily reading your inspiring stories and it helps more than you’ll ever know. Message me anytime for anything, and thank you all! ♥️",5

Is there any way out?,lucyblu663,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1hrlrpn/5_months_sober_and_still_hate_my_life_and_am/,"I’ve been sober 5 months now and I feel like nothing has changed. I feel the same, live the same monotonous life that I realized very quickly only worked for me while using and feel like I can’t get out. I have no friends and therapy and the occasional meeting is not enough, but I feel like I’m incapable of reaching out and putting in the effort to find community and connect with others. I’ve realized I’m mentally ill and it isn’t going away with being sober, I’ve tried so many medications that often make it worse and have been on various meds and in therapy since 15. I feel like there isn’t hope for a better life and I’m so tempted to give up and start using again just so it can be easier to get through the days. I’ve lost everything I cared about and so many opportunities to drug use and despite being only 23 I can’t convince myself that it isn’t over for me already, it feels like it has always been like this and always will. My issues started long before substance use but I haven’t had more than a few days sober (until now) since 16. I don’t know how to live and no one is going to hold my hand through the process of learning how to be a person. I don’t have any motivation because I feel like it’s a losing battle and I’ll never get out of this hole I’ve dug myself. I have ptsd and it’s extremely hard to connect to other people and be vulnerable enough to make new connections and trust that it will be ok, so I find myself completely alone all the time as the rest of the world gets further and further away, and my world gets so small again. I felt like this often while using and was convinced it’d be better when I got sober but it isn’t. The small amount of progress I finally made that convinced me to get sober cuz I finally had hope for the future is completely gone. I keep finding myself thinking maybe it’ll be better on my next try, as if I’ve already given up and know I’ll be using again soon. I don’t know how other people function and move forward. I can’t stop thinking about everything that’s ever happened in my life and I live completely in the past agonizing about everything, I have nothing going on in my life and nothing to bring me out of my head and I’m too cowardly to move forward and find good things for myself and do anything I know would help. I finally got a sponsor last month and have stopped texting and calling, every time I reach out I end up not responding for weeks again, I don’t speak to anyone at work, I feel like a ghost. The only thing that keeps me going is the thought of leaving here forever and just forcing myself to live, I finally got my drivers license, renewed my passport, drafted my two weeks notice- but the end doesn’t feel any closer, I don’t feel any better, it still feels so out of reach. I don’t have confidence I’ll actually do it. In my head I think there’s two options, move in to sober living in another state, find a better therapist, new job, maybe iop- or drive for a while, get out, and come back and start using again until I have hope I can make it and do better. I think so much about using and the comfort of giving up and resigning myself to waiting and ignoring again. If I don’t try, I won’t fail, I won’t ever have to realize it really won’t get better. I’m so tired of waiting for something that may never come and trying for something I might never get and feeling like I’m failing cuz I’m not ever doing enough. Even in iop, going to meetings regularly, everything I was supposed to do I felt so trapped and hopeless. I just want to know there’s some end in sight, some light at the end of the tunnel and this all might be worth it. That I can actually turn things around and have the strength to do it for myself and it won’t be forever that I feel like this. Sorry for how long and depressing this is I just want to know that someone has felt this way and made it out",29

First off, I want to say thank you to everybody who has offered their encouragement over the last thirty days. It means a lot to me. Now, I figured I'd do something a bit differently today. I've given this some thought, but I'd like to share with you guys my story. I'm not entirely sure if this will help some of you out, but perhaps it'll add a more human dimension to the previous posts I've made. I know I've kept things mostly positive over the last month, but clearly I've made some mistakes to be in this predicament. Despite what the posts might suggest, I'm not perfect. I was weak. I struggled the same as everybody else dealing with addiction. Before I continue, there are some parts that might be triggering to read, so you have been warned. Here is my story:

Nearly a decade ago, I was essentially a model student and athlete my senior year of high school. I was a varsity athlete in two sports, my GPA was nearly a 4.0, I had 10 AP courses under my belt, and I volunteered often. I was in a relationship with a girl I had known for about a year at that point. I had a solid circle of friends who shared my interests. I even had a best friend who referred to me as a brother. We innocently started dabbling in weed and alcohol on weekends during nights where we'd hang out and play video games together. Eventually, my best friend started doing drugs alone. Unfortunately, I didn't see this as a sign of mental health issues. I was busy with life and college applications at the time, and he never approached me with his issues. That's usually how us guys are, so I didn't press him further on the issue. It's one of my biggest regrets to this day. I woke up one morning to frantic text messages and phone calls from mutual friends. My best friend had run away from home. I tried desperately to reach out to him, but he disconnected his phone. I prayed he would return. The only thing that returned to me was a message late at night from an unknown number saying ""thank you for being a good friend to me. I'm sorry, goodbye [my name]"". The next morning, police confirmed that he was dead. He committed suicide by jumping in front of highway traffic. This is the event that caused my life to spiral downward. I had lost the one person I truly considered a brother outside of my own family. The anguish in my heart never really faded from that day on. I was denied admission from my university of choice and went to another in-state college, but I hated it. There was a lot of crime and homelessness in the area which made it dangerous if not depressing. I also had to commute nearly 2 hours one way using public transportation which always had some crazy people on there. There was also the issue of traffic in the mornings and afternoons just to get to the metro station. In addition, I had to work part time at a shitty entry level job to pay for transportation costs which included my used car to get to the metro station. The professors at my university didn't even teach under the pretext of an ""inverse class format"", which was awful for STEM majors like me. The point is, I felt like I worked my ass off throughout my teenage years for nothing. I began to question my own existence. One day on the way back from classes, I met a guy I knew somewhat from high school. He said I looked beat, which I was, and recommended I try kratom. I had no idea what he was talking about, but he said it was this herbal supplement that helps with mood and energy. It sounded too good to be true. I decided to give it a shot despite being skeptical, so I stopped by a local smoke shop and purchased a small bag of white maeng da. That day when I got back home, I cracked open the bag and took two grams to try it out. About half an hour later, I experienced the best fucking feeling I have ever felt in my life. It was as if all the happiness and joy I could've felt from my accomplishments up until that moment were transformed into some green powder. Suddenly, the transits to and from college seemed a lot less bothersome. I didn't have any anxiety over tests anymore. I had more energy to study and work. I was on cloud nine. At the time, I had believed I found the cure for my declining mental health. Initially, even my girlfriend was happy I found something that worked for me. However, all it did was repress my real emotions and fatigue. About a year later, I suffered a mental breakdown and had to take medical withdrawal from all my college classes for the semester. My parents were encouraging and said I should take a gap year to take a break and reorient myself. I went with their suggestion, but I began to self-medicate with kratom even more. One day, I ran out of my stash. I told myself it was no big deal, until I started feeling sick several hours later. I convinced myself it was the flu until I bought more kratom and felt better after half an hour. A realization dawned upon me. I was addicted to kratom, a plant I thought was just an herbal supplement. Panicked, I tried to stop, but the withdrawals were intense. At this point, my parents began to notice something was wrong. They found my 250 gram bags and I had no excuses. They tried to take it away from me, but I'd always hide some more that I bought secretly. The addiction began to drain all the money I had saved from work. Then, COVID rolled around and I had no job. Even the unemployment money I got was spent towards kratom. Soon, I resorted to stealing. Not just cash from my parents, but kratom from gas stations when the attendant was gone. At that point, I was eating powder by the spoonful multiple times a day. I was a fucking fiend for kratom. My girlfriend who I had known for about four years during this time saw the writing on the wall. She tried to convince me to stop, but I didn't listen. I lied and made excuses, which eventually she caught on to. That was the last straw for her. She abruptly left me, saying she hated what I had become and never wanted to see my face again. Then, my parents who found out about the stealing were enraged. I overheard my mom tell my dad ""that's not our son. He's a monster"". It was only during that private conversation that I learned I was an accident. I was thoroughly devastated. At that point, I had nothing left to lose, and yet I was determined to lose the one thing I should value the most. I drank a bunch of liquor and stabbed myself in the throat with a knife. Thankfully, I missed my carotid artery by half an inch. I was found passed out and bleeding, but alive and taken to a hospital. Then, I was sent to a psychiatric hospital. I was put on Suboxone and Wellbutrin during my stay until two weeks went by and I was deemed fit for release. I was given another week's supply of Suboxone to taper down from and that was it. Little did I know, PAWS from kratom was lurking around the corner. It hit me like a tidal wave after my last dose of Suboxone. After a few days, I couldn't take it anymore and relapsed on kratom. My parents found out and kicked me out of the house. I was homeless besides my car, but at least I still had some money. It was a few months before I found a job, and another several before I found an apartment to rent with three other people. Life seemed to be shaping up to something better, but I was high on kratom all the time so it was hard to tell. My entire life at this time was just long shifts at a dead-end job to pay rent while the rest went towards drugs and other necessities. I wasn't just doing kratom at this time either. I was getting drunk and smoking weed almost every night. I also picked up a nicotine habit. Between that and work, I did nothing else. I didn't have any friends. My entire free time was spent doing drugs and lounging around in my small apartment room on my phone. Frankly, I thought I could live like this forever. That was until kratom began to affect me differently. I began to have noticeable body tremors whenever I was anxious, and then it shifted to having body tremors all the time. I couldn't function like a normal person in public or at work anymore. At this point it had been three years since I was kicked out on the street and five years since I first knew I was addicted to kratom, so I had likely damaged my body and brain. It was not until a visiting family friend who had known me since I was a kid met me one day and said ""Jesus, are you okay? You look sick"" that I knew I couldn't live like this anymore. I looked at myself in the mirror when I came back to my apartment that day. My skin was pallid. I had visibly dark circles under my eyes. I lost at least 20 pounds in weight. I was a husk of my former self. I truly became the monster my family said I was. I decided I had enough. I got a Suboxone prescription through telehealth and for the next five months I tapered from 4mg down to 2mg per day. At this point, Suboxone had also begun to show its own side effects. I was sick of it. I called my family and explained my situation. Thankfully, they were willing to take me back. However, it was on the condition that I quit all drugs with random testing as proof. That included Suboxone. I weighed my options. Did I really want to rot away for the rest of my life as a poly-drug addict at some entry-level job living paycheck to paycheck in a shitty apartment with multiple roommates? Or would I rather get clean despite the withdrawals with zero comfort drugs if it meant I could have a fresh start and regain the trust of my family? I chose the latter. Today marks the thirtieth day since I quit Suboxone, and also the thirtieth day I began to turn my life around. For once, I can say that I am a man who survived hell and is free from the shackles of addiction for good.

Hopefully my experience has resonated with some of you regardless whether you are just considering getting clean or are currently going through withdrawals. Just know you are not alone. It is possible to beat an addiction to opiates, even ones as powerful and long-lasting as Suboxone. If I can do it, surely you can too. Have patience and be kind to yourself. Eventually, you will be free. I'll see you all tomorrow for my last daily check-in.",10

Those words were spoken to me while I was locked in a trap house as a woman's boyfriend kicked me in the head and ribs. They thought I had robbed them, and they lured me there to get revenge. This was just one of the moments from my nearly six years of being homeless and addicted on the streets of Kensington, Philadelphia.

It's a crazy story. I went from being a correctional officer to a full-time ""hitter"" on the street—a guy who injects others with drugs for money to survive. My life became a cycle of hustling, boosting, getting jumped, and running from the cops, all while battling an addiction to fentanyl and tranq that was literally eating my body alive with flesh-eating wounds.

I was completely hopeless and had resigned myself to dying out there. Then, during the brutal winter of 2024, I got severe frostbite and collapsed on the street. That single event led to a choice in the hospital: a long, painful, and uncertain fight to save my feet, or a double below-the-knee amputation.

Losing my feet was the most traumatic and horrifying experience of my life, but it was also the one thing that finally got me off the streets for good. It forced me into a recovery I couldn't run from.

Today, I'm home with my parents. I have my prosthetics and am learning to walk again, and my girlfriend Britiny is also clean and in a sober house. I've spent the last several months writing my memoir, *Kensington Beach*, to tell the whole unfiltered story.

It's been a hell of a journey. I'm open to answering any questions you guys have about addiction, life on the streets, recovery, or what it's like learning to live again.

I'd also me completely honored if you were to check out my work or even just my page. Thanks guys

Honestly the burnese method worked so well that I’m pissed it isn’t talked about more. I was barely sick at all throughout the entire process despite being heavily addicted. Started at 17, I’m about 3 days clean at this point. For the last 3 years I didn’t even get high off the stuff it was just a bottomless pit I threw money into so I could remain functional. What’s messing with me rn is this constant restlessness and the fact I can’t sleep at all. I feel super unmotivated to do anything, I feel like I should start going to the gym or something in order to get a routine going. I’d love some advice for how you guys managed early recovery ",17
238,1nxl3yh,I’m coming up on 2 years clean and don’t really have anyone to share it with who gets it,brittynicole1019,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1nxl3yh/im_coming_up_on_2_years_clean_and_dont_really/,"Hi,

I don’t post often so here goes. 

Back in 2021 I wanna say, I started using oxy recreationally and eventually started using more and by 2022-23 I was shooting up heroine. 

I was in a very unstable and unhealthy relationship with a guy who had been using and got in to it that way. 

I ended up overdosing and coming back but didn’t even quit after that.. I vividly remember coming to and was being pissed that I fucked up my chance at getting well… 

I mentioned moving out of the city I was living in and moving closer to where I grew up to my family and they basically saved my life unknowingly. Because I moved to a city where I knew no one with the stuff I needed. They thought they were helping me get out of a toxic relationship, which they were but also before I overdosed and didn’t come back. 

I took the month before I moved to try to detox and ended up putting myself in withdrawal. I had a planned birthday vacation with my Mom in Vegas and before we left ended up in urgent care and then after we got back ended up in the ER again so she knew something was up. And so I ended up coming clean to her about everything.

There are only a select few people who know I ever used. The toxic ex and his friends. My very close group of 4-5 friends. My mom (she has tried to explain to my dad how rough of a situation I was in but he refuses to hear about it). And my now fiancé. 

So, I guess I just wanted to come on here and kinda say I’m proud of myself for not slipping and wanting to tell someone that IT’S FUCKING HARD EVERY DAY EVEN WHEN YOU ARE CLEAN FOR 2 YEARS! 

I genuinely have my friends and family to thank for getting me help out of the situation I was in. That’s my biggest advice for anyone on here looking to stay clean. Surround yourself with people who want to support you and won’t judge you! 

Thanks for listening! 
Stay safe and healthy!

Still had cravings for years but it wasnt like this. I truly do not care about anything. I feel genuinely willing to leave my life behind to shoot dope. I have everything going for me. A sane person would have nothing to complain about. And I don't complain about it. And thats why I'd rather die than watch my life slowly implode around me. 


I am buying drugs tomorrow. I am might feel that crazy rush once or twice and then it will be the same banal shit of getting high all day just to be able to put my pants on.

Maybe I’m just in a tough position in life and that’s why the cravings are bad. But I feel abandoned I’m 21 years old I have no choice but to taper off my suboxone with only a few left I try not to take any. But I easily get depressed but some days I feel good. Like I can feel great one day and depressed the next and I don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve been trying to get into better habits and routine but every so often I get craving for drugs. I wish I never touched opiates because the feeling would’ve never interacted with my brain. If I never experienced that high I would have nothing to crave. Maybe I’m just feeling alone because my gf is back with her family for the summer and I’m so used to her being around. Maybe I don’t have enough going on in my life atm. I think it’s a good thing I’m getting off suboxone because I won’t have to rely on it. But I just hate these ups and downs my brain is fucked. Anyways this was a random rant. ,38
243,1krayt4,13 years clean and sober,skimask808,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1krayt4/13_years_clean_and_sober/,"Every once in a while I stop by in this sub reddit to share my story, to hopefully inspire the addict who is still suffering. It also gives me a chance to reflect on the things that worked and went well for me in my recovery, and the times I may have fallen short as well. To start, I am in my early 30's. I started using opiates when I was 14 years old. I remember because I was a freshman in high school. I was having a really rough time in school. Depressed, constantly anxious, and started hanging out with other people with similar issues. Surprisingly, most of my friends didn't use any substances. But I remember one day I was going through medicine cabinets at my house and I found a full bottle of 40mg oxycodone capsules. There were 120 of them. This is where it all started. 

The next week I skipped school most days, and got completely obliterated at home by myself. It was the first time in a long time that I felt truely happy and like myself. There was a switch that went off where I instantly recognized that I had found the thing I was looking for my entire life. My story isn't unlike many others, once the pills ran out, I realized I had a family member who had lupus and was being completely over prescribed opiates. Oxycodone, hydrocodone, oxymorphone, hydromorphone, and even at one point fentanyl patches. No idea what the doctor was thinking prescribing that much. But this set me off into full blown addiction. 

Eventually they noticed the meds were going missing after almost a year. So I had to find something else. This is where heroin came into the mix. IV use came shortly after. This went on for 3 or 4 years. Getting kicked out of my home, losing everything and everyone who loved me wasn't enough to stop killing myself with substances. Even losing my girlfriend of 5 years wasn't enough to stop. I pushed everyone away who actually cared, and continued using, almost to the point of trying to die for a long time. 

Then came the day I overdosed. Valentine's day, February 2012. I woke up in a hospital and a police officer was there. He gave me two options, they found heroin and needles on me and said he could charge and book me for possession of narcotics and paraphernalia, or I could check myself into inpatient rehab. Seeing my parents faces was enough to realize that this was my one chance to turn things around, and I might not get a second chance. So I checked myself into a rehab (surprising the best choice of one too) and started my journey to recovery. 

The recovery part could be a whole new post, but to try to wrap things up as quick as I can I'll just explain what's happened since then. I graduated recently with my bachelor's in Psychology, and am pursuing my master's in social work right now. Should have it in the next year or two. I got licensed in my state as a substance abuse counselor (in training).  I started working about a year ago as a substance abuse counselor, and got the opportunity to intern, and then work at the same rehab that saved my life 13 years ago. I give speeches to new patients weekly, play golf with the same psychiatrist that saved me in 2012 regularly. 

I still deal with cravings. Life still can get crazy and throw me curve balls regularly. But now instead of using I call a friend or talk to a loved one about what im going through. I cope with stress differently now, helping others truly does help me. What I am trying to say is no matter how dark things can get, remember that there is always a way towards recovery. In beginning it can be incredibly hard to stay sober, but after you have a little bit of time, it gets so much significantly easier. You can find out that you do deserve happiness and you do have something positive you can contribute to other people's lives too. Traditional 12 step groups work for a lot of people, but I didn't use them to get sober and don't teach too much about them when I'm running groups. There are other ways to stay sober. 

To the addict still suffering, and the ones who are just starting your recovery journey, keep fighting. Don't give up, no matter how bad things are. Things will get fucking tough before they get easy. But you will never know how great life can be if you don't stick with it. Reach out to people if you need to. And thanks for anyone who got through this jumbled mess of my thoughts today. Best of luck!",7

Anyway I split up with him and told him he had 30 days to get out.  He looked at me and said nothing.  He has not said a single word to me in about 4 days.  I sent him an email as well just to have a paper trail of my giving him notice to leave. 
He hasn’t made any effort to leave.   
I know he has 30 days but I was hoping he would go sooner and I even offered him money to go sooner. I expected he would have some feelings about being broken up with. About not really having the means to leave but also not being welcome here.   He hasn’t made any plans. He has expressed nothing.   Is this oxy?  Just literally no feelings about anything?",35

249,1hu6xi4,Day 4 feeling…. Wow,Wheretheproblemsat,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1hu6xi4/day_4_feeling_wow/,"So here I am in the kitchen with my husband (we’re both on sub) singing the new lion king song totally forgetting that we were feeling like absolute garbage just 4 days ago. I’ve never had a withdrawal that hasn’t had me down for at least a few days before feeling somewhat okay. We both went to work like nothing was wrong, eating and drinking. Doing whatever we can to make sure that we don’t fall into feeling crappy. 

We’ve planned for activities both inside and outside so that we can stay distracted and won’t get bored because boredom or being stuck in your head can easily trigger a relapse. We’ve stopped taking naps so that we are tired enough by the end of the night to sleep throughout the entirety of it. Take showers to avoid RLS. And spend time in the living room with family instead of being in our room. Something needed to change, we needed to change. We were so miserable being stuck in our heads about what went wrong, seeing everyone live life. We need to do that instead of being upset that we don’t. The money used for drugs could be used to go to the movies, out to eat, skating, bowling, anything! But we spent it all on drugs and would be so sad and angry that we didn’t have money to do what other ppl our age are doing (23). No more, no more woe is me. I cannot guarantee full sobriety but I can guarantee that I’m done letting drugs dictate my life and I will do whatever I can to make sure I never fall victim to pills. I won’t let pills make me not want to go out, leave work early to go pick up, take off work because I hadn’t gotten more, make plans and not sticking with them because I was high at the time, and other bull crap. 

I will make it to every doctor, rehab, and therapy appointment. I will go out and try to make friends. I will continue to date my husband and flourish our marriage. I will work hard and earn money to help my husband financially take care of us. I will stay on my prescribed medications. I will live life and not be afraid of the world anymore. I have to. ",11

I actually did it. I chose myself and my future over temporary relief. It doesn't even feel real to me. It seems so silly but for years I've watched people's sobriety journeys with such envy & frustration because I convinced myself I couldn't do it and I would inevitably die this way, but I did it. There's no guarantee that I can keep this up forever or even for another week, but today gave me hope that I might have it in me.

No numbing. No escape hatch. Just me. Raw. Ugly. Real.

2,1lqnn9b,My wife died at 32 from CHS + overprescribed Xanax. Please hear this.,Away-Hippo-8052,148,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1lqnn9b/my_wife_died_at_32_from_chs_overprescribed_xanax/,"I just lost my wife last night.
She was 32 years old.
Beautiful. Brave. Funny as hell, smart, and my best friend. 
Four years clean from heroin. One year sober from alcohol.
Her name was Natasha.

What killed her wasn’t what most people expect.

It was CHS—Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome—made worse by Xanax, overprescribed by a doctor who should have known her history. And it all happened so quietly… until it didn’t.


What CHS Did:

She started vomiting randomly. For hours. Days sometimes.
We thought it was food poisoning. Then anxiety. Then maybe hormones.
Nobody told us weed could do this.
Nobody told us high-THC products can flip on you after years of use.
Nobody warned her that the very thing she thought was helping her… was making her sick.
The first emergency room we went to wouldn't even see us, she was scared and in pain.

What Her Doctor Did:

He prescribed her Xanax for the nausea and sleep.
Not once. Repeatedly.
Even knowing she had a past with benzos and heroin.
Even after we explained how scared we were about her slipping.

And I think…
I think while I was at work, she started using the Xanax more often. Quietly. To sleep. To rest. To escape the pain of vomiting, shaking, losing hope.
And she didn’t tell me.
Because she didn’t want to let me down.


Now I’m Driving Her Car Home. Alone.

She smiled at me the day I left.
I said, “Get better, baby cakey, so we can go on more adventures.”
She smiled and said, “We’ve got so many more to go.” 

But now she’s gone.
And I need you to understand this:

CHS is real.

Long-term weed use can hurt you.

Doctors don’t always listen.

And benzos aren’t harmless.

If you’re fighting this or someone you love is… don’t wait. Speak up. Push back. Taper. Get help. Tell someone.


I’m going to fight to hold the cannabis boards, doctors, and medical systems accountable. But for now, I just needed the world to hear her name. Natasha, please say her name out loud, please. 

She didn’t deserve this.
She deserved a future.
She deserved to be heard.

And if this post saves even one person from the same fate—then her voice still echoes.


Thanks for listening. I’m not okay. But I’m still here.
If you have questions about CHS, addiction, or grief—I’ll answer what I can.",78
3,1hisl61,I'm officially one year clean from opiates!!!,Hatefulthrowawayacc,141,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1hisl61/im_officially_one_year_clean_from_opiates/,"Since I was 16 years old opiates have been a monumental part of my life. I started by taking my mom's old oxys that she would stash for herself. But when that dried up I moved on to Percocets that I would get from my friends at school. The next two years spiraled into a never-ending cat-and-mouse game of me trying to hide my use from the people in my life. I went as far as to intentionally isolate myself from my family and my friends just so I could be alone and nod out for a little while longer. Sadly this habit was never discovered by my parents or any significant figure. I remember this time in my life vividly, and with that, I remember my attitude towards my addiction. The intense denial I was in still makes me say out loud ""What the fuck was I thinking"".

 And then one day in November of 2023 I od'd for the first time. I'll never forget the fear I felt when I found out what happened, in that moment I don't think I couldve spoken if I wanted to, all I could do was cry and hold myself. That was the very first moment I accepted what was wrong with me. I spent the better part of December 2023 detoxing and let me tell you, it was a new circle of hell. I remember thinking to myself that this was worse than active addiction, I could feel every part of my body heating up like I was in the hottest sauna of my life but simultaneously I was shivering and felt an instinctive need to get warm, for lack of a better term it felt like hell froze over. 

That's not me saying the next 11 months were any easier, it wasn't. Every little thing made me think of percs I remember sitting in class and feeling this overpowering urge to get high again. I felt so bad, it felt like every part of my body was tingling with an intense mental and physical pain, a pain that would only be relieved if I just picked up my phone and called my plug. But by some stroke of luck or maybe divine intervention (If you're big into religion) I stayed clean.

 And now here I am, 19 years old and officially one year clean off opiates. I still get those urges from time to time especially if I am bored at the house with nothing to do and I've accepted that this will be a factor that I will deal with for the rest of my life and I'm ok with it, but as I've gone longer and longer without using I've found more and more ways to mentally tell myself NO! Nobody in my life that is significant like my mom or my friends knows this fact about me so I figured this is the best place to share! I still smoke weed, drink and every once in a while I'll do psychedelics with my friends but I made this promise to myself: I will never use opiates for recreational use ever again! And I will do everything in my power to keep that promise no matter what happens.",37

It started with pills in college, Percs and Xanax at first. Then came heroin. Then crack. Then fentanyl. Then tranq. He’s overdosed at least six times (that we know of). I’ve gotten the calls, the kind that freeze your blood, and somehow, by the grace of God and some incredible doctors and nurses, he survived every one.

For a long time, I didn’t think he’d make it to 30. I’ve seen him steal, lie, disappear, and come back a shell of himself. And yet, he’s still here. Still breathing. Still trying.

And just last month, he became a father.

He still struggles. He’s not “fixed.” But something in him shifted when that baby was born. I saw it in his eyes, like maybe, just maybe, there’s still something worth fighting for.

I wanted to share this not because it’s a perfect ending, it’s not. But because sometimes we need reminders that it’s never too late to turn a new leaf. That the same person who’s burned every bridge can still build something new.

If you pray, I’d ask you to say one for him and his daughter. And if you’re still in the middle of it, still lost in the cycle, please know there’s still hope.

Even now. Especially now.

Opioid withdrawal is not “just the flu.” People who haven’t lived it think it’s about some body aches or nausea, something you can grit your teeth through. But the reality is far more brutal. Withdrawal can feel like being trapped inside your own body while every nerve screams. It is panic, desperation, crawling-out-of-your-skin agony, and for many, a psychological torment that pushes them toward unsafe choices or even suicide. People hang themselves or overdose during withdrawal—not because they are weak, but because the suffering is indescribable.

Right now, in the United States, people in acute opioid withdrawal have almost no rapid, legal, humane way to get relief. Emergency rooms often send patients away with nothing. “Comfort meds” can only do so much. Methadone clinics require long lines, paperwork, intake processes, urine tests, and strict schedules—things a person in severe withdrawal cannot realistically navigate. Buprenorphine can be life-saving, but access is still too limited, too slow, and too dependent on finding the right provider at the right moment.

When someone is in crisis, time is everything.

We need a fast, legal, medically supervised alternative—something people can access immediately to stabilize themselves until they can enter a longer-term program. The system treats withdrawal as a moral issue instead of a medical emergency, and people are dying because of it.

Imagine if we treated heart attacks or asthma attacks the way we treat withdrawal:
“Sorry, come back at 4 AM for intake.”
“Try again when we have time.”
“You’ll just have to suffer through it.”

This is unacceptable.

People in withdrawal deserve:

Emergency access to safe, fast-acting medication that prevents crisis, self-harm, overdose, or relapse.

A walk-in, no-barrier stabilization option—just like urgent care—staffed with medical professionals trained in addiction medicine.

Policies that acknowledge withdrawal as a true emergency, not a moral failure.

Legal and accessible medications that offer immediate relief while someone waits for a full treatment intake.


We already do this for countless other medical conditions. Why not for opioid withdrawal, where the stakes are literally life and death?

If we want to save lives, reduce suffering, and give people a real chance to recover, we must treat withdrawal with the urgency and dignity it deserves. No more turning people away. No more making them wait hours or days while their bodies and minds are on fire. No more preventable deaths.

People deserve compassion.
People deserve relief.
People deserve a system that doesn’t make them beg for help while they’re fighting for their lives.",62

Austin? Yo austin, you alright???!!! Fuck! Dude, wake up your overdosing. ” i yell into his lifeless, rigid face while slapping him. DUDE WAKE UP. i kick him in the stomach in a panic. A feeling of deep, unadulterated fear hits me like a semi fueled with meth. Fuck! Dude im going to narcan you bro wake the fuck up!! I look for the narcan. Where the fuck!@@@ is the narcan!!!im hyperventilating. In my mind its to late to call 911 its been about 3 minutes. THINK! The car! The narcan is 3 stories down in the hotel parking lot. That might as well be in fucking bangcock. I feel the feeling of death creep into my psyche. This cannot be happening. I think of the phone call to my mom i will have to make.   Everything looked like it was melting. My world was melting. I wish i was never born.

I grab my 2009 satur vue keys and bust through the door then my stomach drops as i almost let the door close without having the room key. That would be instant death for my brother and probably suicide for me if that door closed. I take my shoes and wedge them so it doesnt shut and i fucking run. It was the longest run ill ever have to run. Each step a eternity. Dread filled my nostrils as tears jetted down my sunken face. Run faster you fuck!  I see my dented saturn. I tear apart the dash and grab the narcan. Its august and its hot and its probably 2am and my brother is in our hotel room dying. Ill never talk to him again i thought to myself as i run back through hell. I will never forget the hallway from the stairs to the room. Never-ending regret. I have never felt so helpess and alone. If hell had a feeling. This was it

I ram through the door like a skinny minature tweaker kool aid man. Hes in the same locked up rigamortis position. I get him flat on his back and i pop the narcan and stick it up his stupid nose. I slap him a few times and immediatly start cpr. Fuuuuck austin please dont do this. Please dont leave me here alone on this weird fucked up planet!!! Im crying as i give cpr. I look at his pale blue face and i slap it hard as i can i punch him in the stomach angry and hoping it will trigger something and he wont die. I try dragging him to the shower but alas im not strong enough im screaming for help. It feels like this is a  cruel joke. Where the fuck are you ashton!!@ i continue cpr for probably 10 minutes. I taste blood,our teeth have been colliding and made me bleed. I can taste the taco bell we ate about a hour earlier. Fuck i miss that time era. Right now i would do anything to switch spots with my brother. My little brother is dying. Im giving cpr to my little brother. God please help me. Please dont let him die.  I promise ill be a better bigger brother. Ill get sober and serve you. Please i cant handle this !!@..

Im giving chest compressions, then lift his head up, hoping to open airways. Then the best sound I’ve ever heard graced my ears. Like a hoover vacuum, he took a deep inhale and started choking. I collapse against the wall and look at him while he takes in his surroundings.  “What happened fuck did i overdose?” He says angerly. I nod. He comes over and lifts me up and says ” im so sorry dude i didnt mean to put you through that. Thank you for saving my life” while he hugs me. A wave of relief washes over my body. Over the next hour i almost overdose i was told. I smoked a bunch of fetty trying to get the feelings out of my head. It was two more months of hardcore drug use and debauchery for us to finally go to rehab again. Sorry lord.",30
7,1k3nnbh,Flushed down the toilet..,DripPureLSDonMyCock,96,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1k3nnbh/flushed_down_the_toilet/,"Hey I just wanted to share a success moment. I was looking for something last night in my attic and I came across a bunch of empty sub wrappers. My inner junkie said ""look in them, maybe you left a piece in it!"" I looked and saw there was a half in one. I instantly had a moment of clarity and thought ""dude you're fucking clean now, don't you want to stay that way?? You went through everything to be here right now .. flush it."" I walked downstairs and flushed it. The symbolic part of it was I took a shit earlier and thought I flushed but it didn't actually go down so I dropped the piece in a pile of shit then flushed. Obviously subs played an important role in being sober today but going back out of nowhere to get high is shit. Fuck that. 

I was really proud of myself because situations like that in the past were always my downfall. The lesson learned is to immediately flush it. My first reaction was I put it in the trash and kept looking for something...junkie translation: I'll be back for you later. Have a good one y'all.",27

And if you’re sober, you should too.",problyurdad_,98,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1j2km2o/ive_accepted_it_and_if_youre_sober_you_should_too/,"Maybe this will help someone some day. A perspective that has recently came to vision for me and it put a nail in the coffin that is my addiction.       
       
Hi everybody, I’m Problyurdad_, and I’m a heroin addict. I’m going to be 42 years old this year. I first dabbled with heroin back in 2008, the same way many of you did - I got injured at work a few years prior, and was sent home with what should’ve been a ten year supply of opiate pain meds that I burned through in about 4 days (hyperbolic relief, it’s okay to laugh) and turned to the streets when my doctor wouldn’t supply me any more pills, because I wasn’t doing the physical therapy because physical therapy made me feel better and I didn’t want to feel better I wanted pills.            
        
Back then, fentanyl was just starting to rain on heroins parade. Most of the dope we could get our hands on smelled strongly of vinegar, it was light brown, and it made you feel like you were warm and cozy wrapped up in a blanket with a smile on your face. It made you feel good!  It didn’t make you itch. It didn’t make your eyes and nose run. It didn’t give you rosacea. Most of all, it didn’t make you a raging psychopath with wildly unpredictable behavior that you couldn’t remember or control.             
        
In fact, all it ever did was make the day better. I could work harder, faster, longer, and I (thought) I found a drug that finally made me feel great again. Normal, so it seemed. Until the fentanyl started creeping in.       
       
And now, in hindsight, I’m glad it did. Because when I was on heroin cut with fentanyl, I was a much different person. People could tell. I could no longer hide my habit. My behavior was too outlandish. For example, one of my best friends stayed over one night after a concert. He slept on the couch. Before bed I went to the bathroom to shoot up. That’s all I remember. But according to him, I wrapped toilet paper around myself and came back out to the living room and brought it to him as a present. He had to guide me back to my bed. I woke up around 4 am and he wasn’t on the couch and I didn’t know why. He had left after that because he didn’t want to be around it. I don’t blame him.          
          
I went rehab later that summer (2019) and had 5 years of sobriety under my belt before I got the itch to dabble again. And dabble I did, and once again my behavior immediately gave me away. I did things I can’t even tell you because I don’t remember. But my kids saw, my wife saw, and that was the end of that. I dabbled for about a week and then checked right back in to the hospital, never to look back again. Because now I know, and now I am 100% aware, that whatever it is I am looking for from heroin is long gone. Those days are over, and I can’t even get my hands on what I would traditionally say is my drug of choice, the experience I’m seeking, the feelings I’m trying to feel….         
        
If you’re thinking about using again, don’t. Whatever it is you’re looking for isn’t there anymore. The experience you want is long gone. You’re not going to be able to hide it, and it’s not going to be what you have in your head as an idea for it anyways. It’ll be way different and the only thing you’ll gain from it is experience, and another time you wish you hadn’t picked it back up again. Trust me. I know. ",25

I was about 96 hours sober from heroin. I was actually feeling pretty good besides the back pain. No other symptoms other than back pain. I made a post in here about having back pain and someone recommended 7-oh, so I got a pack of pills. 


I took one last night and I felt fucking fantastic, pure bliss. I took another this morning and felt great..it last about 4 hours. It worked great... Too great, but when I woke up I realized I woke up sicker with withdrawal symptoms that I thought had went away. 

Did deeper research this morning and come to find out, it doesn't just work like an opioid, IT IS AN OPIOID. No different than heroin, percs, morphine, etc. so after it wore off I felt more dope sick than before. So not only is it an opioid, it's 22x stronger than morphine and 4x stronger than heroin. It literally took me back to day 1 of my detox, except the withdrawals were way worse than before. 

Update: I got a bag of H last night. But I don't consider it a relapse... More like a reset. Give those stupid pills enough time to get out my system, just a week, and then stop again. I can handle heroin withdrawals anytime, but the withdrawal I felt from those 7oh pills were just completely unbearable. I couldn't function at all. 


So just putting this here to warn others. Don't take it unless you've completely detoxed from your DOC.

I was recently banned from the subreddit for brining up the fact that it has a lot of religious reference and mention of god, as well as congratulating someone who posted about being clean from hard drugs while still smoking weed and sharing my own situation.

The moderation team made it explicitly clear that it is not a place for questioning their own narrative and have no qualms about silencing someone who goes against their own status quo.

I was told that, as a member of NA for 10+ years and someone who was born and raised within the rooms that I was not welcome there.

I mentioned how their ban actually violated their own rules and they proceeded to mute me.

I’m sharing this as a warning because all it takes is one power tripping mod to shun away a struggling person and they could end up triggering a relapse causing someone to overdose.

In fact I will be writing to the narcotics anonymous head office to lodge a complaint about an online community using the Narcotics anonymous name in an unfortunate way and it sends a bad message to any would be newcomer that maybe they would get kicked out of the in person rooms too if they said the wrong thing.",70

It's incredible how much my life has changed since I made the plunge to drop everything I was doing and asked my parents if I could stay with them while I completely quit outright. Man that was a solid 2 weeks a real shake rattle and roll followed by another 2 months of just generally feeling shitty but still I was excited. I spent my entire adult life a lying piece of shit junkie so at 31 I was completely unsure of where to start or what to do except stay off dope. At 7 months clean I successfully moved out of my parents to a city I always wanted to move to and did is the right way. But something unexpected happened. I met someone I wanted to start a family with so we eventually moved back to where I was from and got us a cute little house just a bit from Lake Michigan. I thought life couldn't have been better, like I never thought I'd be spending my days after work loading up the car with a cooler and my sweetheart and driving to the beach for an evening swim.

I also got to mention the gratitude that a person has after getting clean. It's seriously unreal. Like every single thing is amplified in how good it feels knowing I was so close to never having that joy ever again.

I would argue that the process itself—the act of contacting a dealer, meeting them at a designated location, acquiring the drugs, and returning home—can be just as addictive. There is something inherently thrilling to the human brain in engaging in activities we know are illegal, yet manage to execute without detection, evading the government’s reach. This illicitness creates a sense of euphoria in itself.

I have heard of countries such as Portugal and cities like Amsterdam, where drug use has been decriminalized, and interestingly, abuse rates are lower compared to when substances were criminalized. The thrill that comes with the illegality of the act seems to be a significant factor in the addiction; when drugs are legalized, that thrill diminishes, making the substance itself less enticing. Additionally, there is a certain euphoria associated with the ability to acquire what one desires when so many are disconnected from access, unable to obtain what they need when they need it.",63

Get your ass into the clinic and start dosing and get your life back. Suboxone is a great medication for people addicted to opiates that AREN'T Fentanyl because Fent gets stored in your fat and therefore is sending people into PWD who have waited 4-5 days. It's not worth the gamble when Methadone is a full agonist and therefore doesn't cause this issue. I will say that it sucks pecker having to drive to the clinic every day in the beginning while you establish trust and hand in enough clean drug tests to get take homes. If you have been going for long enough and haven't failed any drug screens (minus weed) you will get take homes. Call u your local clinic and see if they take insurance AND if they do and you don't have any, your counselor should be able to give you some resources :)",90
27,1hwv1f7,"Threw almost four years clean down the drain. Put some sense into my fucking head

",Ok_Intention6827,64,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1hwv1f7/threw_almost_four_years_clean_down_the_drain_put/,"Back in 2020, I went to rehab after a year long OC80 habit. At the end I ate three to four of those blue fuckers a day, it was terrible. I did the whole nine yards: got clean, moved cities, went to university, got a prestigious internship and finished my bachelors thesis with highest grades. All great, everybody so proud, but all along I was feeling like shit. I was young when I went to rehab, and I was in such a rush to get out in the world and prove everybody wrong that I didn't gave two fucks about what caused my addictive behaviour.

Some months back, in June, I started taking benzodiazepines, I guess it was for anxiety symptoms. i never did it to get high, only in normal doses per se. Don't think I've ever taken over 40mg diazepam over 24 hrs. I made a deal with myself: hand in your bachelor thesis in December, then seek help. And that's what I did. I'm in the midst of a taper with my local addiction center, and on that front it's great something is being done. They might even offer me some therapy.

A few weeks back, although, life took unexpected turns. I was crushed, emotionally and financially. I bought an OC80, did 40mg, saved 40mg for the day after and nodded the fuck out for two days. The warm blanket felt exactly the way I remembered it. I know why I did it, but I regret it just as much as taking that first benzo back in June.

It was in the mid of December, today is January 8th, and I just did it for I think the tenth time or something like that. The 20mg don't get me nodding anymore, 40mg barely does. I can go two to three days, sensing no withdrawals, but then I do them again. As mentioned, this has been going on for some weeks.

I went to this sub for so much advice, support and comfort back in 2020 and 2021 when I was in active addiction and in my recovery phase. Now I'm on the steps of a nasty oxy habit again. Apparently, I can't get into my head what it is I'm doing. I did around 50mg tonight, and I plan of doing the rest. It will be the last pill, but I said that the last time and the last time again.

This may sound so fucking dumb, but please, someone, remind me why we don't do this shit. Remind me why this is the direct pathway to misery. Remind that I'm better than this. Remind me there's still a turning point without going through the whole nine yards again. I'm not sure I can do that.

28,1klt4qp,I FOUND a legitimate malindkroft fentanyl hcl patch while walking to the grocery store today.,insyzygy322,61,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1klt4qp/i_found_a_legitimate_malindkroft_fentanyl_hcl/,"Just last week I was thinking about how im now far enough away from my last sublocade injection that I could probably break through it with fent. 

However, I've never done street fent, and never plan on it. I was a pharma opi to real heroin addict, through and through. 

With that being said, I used to smoke gel fent patches back in the day. Wasn't my fav, but it when it was available, I used it. 

Hadn't thought about fent patches in a very long time.. until last week.. when I had this thought 'hey, you don't fuck with street 'fent', and that's good.. but imagine if it was the year 200x and you had access to fent patches. Wouldn't that be cooooool?'

The absolute shock when I reached down at the end of my block and picked up a sealed malindkroft 25 mcg/hr patch.. MAN. 

It felt trippy. Like, the universe whispering in my ear.

""Here, want to try? Try.""

Not even a fucking ounce of desire once it was in my hand. 

Immediately walked down to the encampment down the block and gave it away.. couldn't exactly bring myself to destroy it. Technically harm reduction for someone smoking street fent lol

What a trip. Hadn't seen one of those in over a decade. Never thought I'd see them again. 

Feels liberating, in a way. I don't even regret it now that I've calmed down. I've had some past experiences where I ditch a substance in these sorts of scenarios and regret it deeply like 10 mins later. 

Truly a trip

Edit:

Thanks so much for the love, everybody! I have a tendency to invalidate myself, and really didn't even see it as an 'accomplishment' of any sort until y'all convinced me it was. 

Something inside of me fights me hard when I attempt to be proud of myself, but I'll keep doing my best to recognize that my actions were a manifestation of years and years of hard work. I didn't just 'not have desire to use it'. 

Much love 🫶 ",30

31,1libd6j,Opiate withdrawal,Economy_Succotash751,58,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1libd6j/opiate_withdrawal/,"I asked chatgpt to write a description of what withdrawals felt like. It understood the assignment...

Opiate withdrawal is a deeply physical and emotional ordeal — a storm that tears through the body and mind with brutal clarity. It often begins like the onset of a severe flu, but it quickly escalates into something more punishing and unrelenting.

In the beginning, there's a creeping unease, a gnawing sense that something is wrong. The body feels tense, wired with nervous energy. Anxiety starts to rise, like a drumbeat in the chest, accompanied by yawning, watery eyes, and a runny nose. These may seem minor at first, but they signal the opening notes of the full symphony of suffering to come.

As hours pass, restlessness sets in. Muscles ache, deep in the bones — not like soreness from overuse, but a crawling, burning tightness that won’t be soothed. The skin feels too tight and too sensitive all at once. People often describe it as feeling like ants are crawling beneath their skin, or like their body is trying to tear itself out from the inside.

The gastrointestinal system turns traitor. Nausea churns in the stomach. Cramps twist the gut with merciless precision. Diarrhea becomes relentless. Appetite vanishes. Vomiting may begin. It feels as though the body is purging itself, desperate to rid itself of toxins, but in doing so, it strips away comfort, control, and dignity.

Sleep becomes impossible. The body is exhausted but won’t rest. Every attempt to lie still is disrupted by chills that shake the spine, followed by waves of sweating that leave the sheets drenched. Legs twitch uncontrollably — restless leg syndrome becomes maddening. It's like trying to sleep while being electrocuted from the inside out.

Psychological distress builds alongside the physical. Anxiety intensifies into panic. Depression creeps in like a heavy fog. Thoughts become chaotic, dark, and hopeless. Cravings claw at the brain, screaming for relief, for the drug that could silence this pain. There's a profound sense of despair — not just over the withdrawal, but over the realization of how tightly the drug has coiled itself around every system in the body.

Time distorts. Hours feel like days. Every second is felt acutely. There's no distraction strong enough to cut through the agony. Some people cry. Some rage. Some stare blankly, barely able to speak.

Eventually, the storm begins to ease — but the emotional weight may linger long after the physical symptoms subside. Guilt, shame, fear of relapse, and a shattered sense of self often remain. Even in the calm, the memory of withdrawal haunts like a ghost.

Opiate withdrawal isn’t just discomfort. It’s a full-body rebellion, a psychological unraveling — and for many, a terrifying glimpse into how powerfully these substances have taken hold. But with support, safety, and care, recovery is possible. Even from this.

I remember him opening it and seeing all these written messages inside and I think it mighta been the first time I had even seen a yearbook.  All the messages said things like What's up Ganja _____ STAY HIGH my brother, your best friend.  Or ""I'll never forget the first time tripping with you"" or ""Signed, the ______ bar boyzzz"" CHEERS!  My brother was laughing n so excited reading it like HOLY SHIT I can't believe this is dad's!  We grew up hearing about the trippy 60s, the art, how drugs were such an influential part of that era.  

Growing up, it seemed like any movie kids wanted to see in the 90s- and did - romanticized tf outta drugs.  Every time someone smoked, popped a pill, hit a vein, the cinematics would intensify n it'd usually be attached to something very emotional or powerful in the movie.  Almost every kid I knew, I'd heard say, ""I'd try that once if I could"".  Well, I was raised very strict and though my parents drank at parties, I never saw any drugs at the parties.  By the time I was 12, I was smoking cigarettes, as were most of my friends (strangely, it was kinda normal for kids to go through adults coats for cigs at a party even at that age, we'd try to hide it but it was almost like ""looks like the kids found some cigarettes they're smoking out there"").  Even into the 2000s some movies, especially about teens, the whole basis of the movie would be how they were getting x, y, z for a party or for whatever.  Soon after, I tried weed.  Then I got my first bf who was a huge drinker n he was older.  I began drinking daily.  

The house in my neighborhood that we used to chill at was full of teens n young 20s in n out non stop, all my friends, all way older than me.  The dude who lived there's mom was almost never there n when she did get there she did crack in her room n didn't seem to notice or care that her son had turned her house into the equivalent of an illegal drug den, I mean, we graffitid artwork all over her fkn walls...  When she was friendly which was rare, it was usually cuz we were holding something she wanted.

My freshmen year in HS was absolute hell.  I was finally out from under my parents very tight watch and I just remember being angry all the time at every fkn adult that had something to say to me in that building.  Almost daily the deans would pull me in the office, go thru my backpack, steal all my sharpies n paint markers n spray paint.  Graffiti was a huge part of my life at the time and I was the only girl I knew who went bombing n they just kept taking all my shit. I remember how I felt when he'd open my new pack of Newports and break them all in front of me over the garbage while barking at me and I was INFURIATED.  I'd walk out every time, meet up w my bf n start drinking.  They kept kicking me out of every hs I went to cuz I never went.  I was now at that drug house drinking from 7am to midnight every day.  Doing every drug that came through.  Never went to Sophomore year, just dropped out n kept going to that house every day.  It was only a few blocks from where I lived.

Then my bf went on vacation with his family but I kept going there cuz all my ""friends"" were there.  They had been scheming and I had noooooo fkn clue, what a stupid little girl.  The first day my bf was gone I remember this tall guy who was half black half Italian n had always seemed like one of the more normal dudes who'd only come thru once in a while....he was walkin towards the house w a huge bottle of vodka and I was sitting on the porch w my 22oz Heineken.  He said wow!  Thank God you're here, I got this for you!  Which was suspicious at first n I was like why?  And he said remember that night last week?  You gave me so many of your Heinekens and cigs so I got you this to repay you.  I figured he just stole it for me n I was like alright cool thx.  He said, I'll brb I'm just gonna run in n make myself a quick drink, I gotta go, you can have the rest.  

I don't know what happened after that first sip but I woke up and I couldn't move.  I opened my eyes and I was in a house I'd never been in before laying on someone's couch and the room was full of men, wall to wall.  I was naked.  They put a dropper in my mouth n I went black again.  I was kidnapped, raped repeatedly.  Somehow didn't end up pregnant or sick with anything.  It was the biggest secret in the neighborhood and every guy knew, soon their gfs were finding out ""I had fkd their man"".  I got into so many fkn fights, couldn't go anywhere in my neighborhood, fought nearly every girl I ever knew.  But I was too something ... scared..  proud... fkd in the head to tell anyone what really happened those 3 days.

That was the breaking point I think.  I was determined to be as numb as possible at all times cuz I had nobody to talk to about this, I didn't know what to do.  And, tbh I felt like a pos, like trash, disposable, to be used n discarded.  Around that time I just started going to bars and clubs every night.  Made new friends, got more fucked up, bounced all over NYC til 4 am every morning.  I had fun, so many good times, but plenty of pretty bad ones too.  Then, sometime while I was still doing what I was doing I got into a really bad car accident.  My doctor prescribed me Oxy 30s 3x a day.  I finally found my FAVORITE drug.  Kept running out he kept giving more, more, more.  Until one day I show up and he says I'm sorry, I can still give you the spinal shots but the meds you were on I can only give to cancer patients now.  I was pretty angry about it tbh cuz these pills on the street weren't cheap n I had a HABIT and a fkn half.  I decided whatever I'll just get them if I see someone has em, guess I can't have em every day anymore.  I was at a friend's house when all the sudden I thought I was dying, I panicked and told my friends something was wrong.  They were asking a million questions and I remember mumbling something about stopping the pills n maybe that's why and one guy was like OXY?  YOU'RE IN WITHDRAWAL!  YOU COULD FKN DIE!  YOUR DR DIDN'T GIVE YOU ANYTHING?  SUBOXONE?  I didn't even know what a suboxone was bro I was so like, uninformed about this shit.  I just knew I was gonna die that night and I layed down.  Not even 5 mins later the same guy comes in the bedroom n he's like you sniff coke?  And I'm like yeah u got?  He's like no, sniff this n you'll feel better.  That's ALLLLLL I had to hear I didn't care if it was rat poison just make me feel like I'm NOT dying PLEASE.  It was heroin.

So, I replaced the pills with sniffing heroin.  All I knew in my empty stupid head was keep doing this at all costs, you won't die.  I became his dealer's top custy.  For years I always kept a tight circle of dope friends.  I had met a girl who I got along with for once.  We became best buddies, basically did everything together, tried to quit together at a Methadone clinic, kept using.  By that time I was using needles.  We both got to a point that it was getting really hard to find a vein that worked anymore.  She got a bad infection in her right arm and it was bad enough she was hardly able to move her arm.  I kept telling her she had to get it seen cuz it looked really bad but since it was always covered I'd forget about it then realize again and ask if she went to the dr yet and I really don't know why she wouldn't just go to the hospital n let them patch it up, fix it, whatever had to be done.  But we were on a constant chase for dope and it just took a backseat, one day right as I dropped her off in front of her house, she said something to me, that for the first time ever, since I knew her, made me mad and not just mad, but I peeled out off her block as she was holding her stomach.  3 hrs later she texted ""I'm in the hospital call me plz"" and I guess I assumed she was at the ER for her arm but I remember just throwing my phone back on my bed like fk u bitch I've been saying let's go for months now you decided to go the day you pissed me tf off?  Get fkd 🖕

She was dead by the morning.  Sepsis.  I lost my fkn mind.  The guilt.  The only female friend I ever cared about is dead and it's my fault.  I was so consumed with my bs that I didn't just make the appointment for her like a good friend n take her.  And my last words to her before she died was ""good, u dumb bitch, keep letting him rob u then, I'm not saving you next time your shit is gone"".  

She had no family at all but one sister who had written her off eons ago.  I called n told her that her sister had died and she said good and hung up.  She had absolutely nothing, nobody, that cared but me.  I was her emergency contact in the hospital.  I did the best I could with what I could, paid for everything I had to, got her ashes.  I couldn't stop crying for weeks, so many regrets, so much pain, there wasn't any amount of now, fent - that would stop my eyes from puddling up constantly.  I sat in my childhood bedroom again, a total mess.  Surrounded by ashtrays, bottles, needles, stamp bags all around me.  I stayed in bed killing myself slowly, and paying a high price to do it.  In my head for some reason I was thinking I had only been doing dope for 10 yrs.  I stayed alone for 3 yrs for the most part, couldn't enjoy partying anymore.  Every day I hoped I'd get a bag they measured wrong or something and I could just be at peace.

Then one day I got a phone call from this really cool kid I had met at rehab once.  He was the only one not trying to get in my pants and we had a great time in rehab together, so I picked up.  He said hey and asked how I was n he told me he was 5 yrs clean.  He was off the streets and in college.  It didn't even sound anything like the guy I remembered.  He was in the rooms, doing the work and doing a good job.  He kept begging me to make a meeting n I was stubborn.  But I finally decided after the new year I'd get clean.  He kept checking in on me n it helped me stick to my plan.  So I went for it when the time came.  I was so tired of feeling sad, so tired of paying to kill myself slowly.  I didn't have the balls to jump off my roof.  I had already tried.

I knew I didn't wanna be back in that methadone clinic w all the dope dealers outside n everyone still using and I had read about the Bernese method and just said, it's time.  I was pasted to my bed for 9 days, truly thought I might die but I didn't even care, I was NEVER touching that garbage again, no matter what it took.  I feel like all I kept saying to myself was ""tomorrow it'll be 5% better"".  I must have said it a thousand times and I finally fell asleep that 9th night.  I woke up and I could sit.  It was over.  I smiled so big and looked up, and thanked my friend.  I love you so much. I'm so sorry I didn't do the right thing. Thank you, God, I love you.  I cried tears of pure joy for the first time in my life.  It was so powerful, the only thing I could imagine could be like what I was feeling was giving birth.  I was SO HAPPY.  SO HOPEFUL.  I don't think I had ever felt real hope before that.  

Today is my 36th day off fent, subs, and every other pos garbage I can think of.  Thanks for reading, if anyone bothers to.  

You'll never be able to succeed until you're ready...it's true.  Until you've really just become so disgusted with yourself and your life that you can push through it.  My best friend died in '22 and it's '25.  Once I got clean I realized I had been on dope not for 10 yrs, but 22.  Please, look for a sign, look for hope.  Go to a meeting.  This has changed my life in such an enormous way.  All I ever remember knowing my entire life was pain.  I can finally feel again.  When I talk to my nephews, I can feel their joy and it makes my heart smile.  I promise you.  It's better on this side.

I still drive by that drug house multiple times a week.  Neighborhoods change, people change, even the house looks a bit spruced up and every time I see that family on the porch or going into the house, I thank God that they have no idea how much young laughter happened in that house as we all were killing ourselves.  My biggest regret is that my friend, my best friend that I ever had, had to die before seeing that life could be beautiful.  All we needed to do was stop looking for it in the wrong place.  I love each and every one of you and there's a place for you here, right next to me.  I'm not scared, I'm not sad, I'm actually at peace and I promise, you can be too.",16
33,1j0s1k1,Why methadone is so strictly regulated in the US,Low_Music_9744,58,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1j0s1k1/why_methadone_is_so_strictly_regulated_in_the_us/,"
I just started going to my local methadone clinic, and I find it extremely idiotic that they require you to go every single fucking day for years. And it's not just the issue of going but also waiting 1 to 3 hours each day (at least in my area). This is completely absurd—I don't know how anyone would be able to hold a job while having to attend the BS clinic every day. I can only conclude that the U.S. doesn't actually want to stop this ""opioid epidemic"" and that these centers are just there to make a profit, not to help.

For context, in my home country (Colombia), you only need to see a primary physician, usually a toxicologist, who will prescribe a month's supply of methadone that you just need to pick up at your local pharmacy. And this is the way it’s done in a lot of other countries. Mind you, Colombia is supposedly ""third world,"" and even so, paying for both the physician and the medication will only run you about $100 per month.

With all this in mind, I ask: Are there any plans to update these outdated and backward-ass regulations in the U.S. regarding methadone? Are these regulations coming from the government, or are they up to the methadone clinics’ discretion? Is anyone doing anything about this? And if not what would you recommend me to do, because I definately do not intent to keep wasting 2 hours each day (more than I wait on my dealer) and spending nearly as much as I did in dope.

43,1j9jnde,Day 24 of cold turkey after a three year addiction.,Dirigivient,48,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1j9jnde/day_24_of_cold_turkey_after_a_three_year_addiction/,"This is an update from my previous posts. 

This has been the toughest war with my own mind I’ve experienced yet. Doing this all on my own without any outside support from anyone at all has been a significant challenge.

The only really good news is that I no longer feel sick. The bad news is that dealing with the post acute symptoms is harder than the initial 2 week sickness. I have terribly low energy & lack the motivation to really do anything at all. I’m also trying to be comfortable with being more bored than I’ve ever been. Yet everyday I sit here and daydream about rebuilding my life, meeting new people and building new connections, but I lack the get up and go to even start. 

I know that asking how long this will persist is like asking how long is a piece of string, but I’m just so desperate for the old me to return, the energetic, outgoing, sociable & hard working me. I went from a guy who never took a day off to struggling to even maintain hygiene. I’m positive hormones are contributing to this, probably low testosterone. If so, would a doctor prescribe it to me, or just tell me to wait for it to return to base level naturally? 

Anyway, the 24 days closing on a month is somewhat of an achievement I guess. But more importantly I’m desperate to not waste any more time after three years of isolation so any advice on what I should expect for the near future regarding low energy & low mood in general would be much appreciated. 

Summer is coming up & I just want to feel somewhat normal again.

For the ones who want to get clean but can’t shake the fear of withdrawals, the pain, or facing life head-on without a crutch.

I’ve been there. I’ve sat on the edge of the bed, sweating, shaking, crying, praying for it to stop — but also praying I don’t go back to using.
I’ve been that dude who thought I was too far gone.

I’ve lost people I love — one recently took their own life — and I ain’t gonna lie, it messed me up bad.
I still deal with chronic pain every single day. I still got demons that whisper in my ear.

But almost 5 years clean from opiates later, I’m still here.
Still fighting.
Still refusing to go back.

And yeah — I’ll keep it real with you — I still smoke weed.
It helps with my anxiety and pain. It keeps me grounded.
Some people won’t agree, and that’s okay.
But it keeps me alive and off the poison that once had me chained.

I still count myself clean because I don’t use to escape anymore — I use it to cope and function, not to disappear.

Getting clean ain’t about being perfect.
It’s about surviving long enough to heal.

You don’t need to have your life figured out.
You don’t need to have a degree, a job, or a support system.
You just need that one thing — the desire to stop dying and start living again.

That’s the spark.
That’s what saved me when nothing else could.

To the PhD who’s popping pills in secret, and to the kid who dropped out and is nodding off in a trap house — I see you.
You both deserve recovery.
You both deserve peace.
You both deserve to look in the mirror and not hate who you see.

Don’t let fear of withdrawals or fear of life keep you from the freedom you deserve.
Yeah, it’s gonna hurt. Yeah, it’s gonna suck.
But that pain? It’s temporary.
And on the other side of it is something you might’ve forgotten existed — hope.

You’re not weak for being scared.
You’re strong as hell for even thinking about changing.

If you’re reading this, it means you still got fight in you.
And that’s enough for today.

One day at a time.
Keep pushing.
Keep breathing.
You’re not alone in this.

I've been severely addicted to both drugs. At my worst I was on 40mg Xanax per day, and I've also been addicted to IV heroin. I think opioid withdrawals are worse because of how many debilitating symptoms there are. 

With benzo withdrawal, the only symptoms I'd experience were anxiety, paranoia, insomnia, depression, and sometimes migraines. I know that sounds like a lot, and don't get me wrong, this all was terrible and could sometimes make me feel crazy, but that was pretty much it. All the symptoms seemed to stem from anxiety. I never had vivid hallucinations, never had a seizure (was on anti-seizure meds), and even at my worst I could still function 1 day completely off benzos if I replaced them with soma or pregabalin. 

Whereas with opioid withdrawal, there's so many symptoms that drive me nuts. The yawns, sweats, flu-like symptoms, RLS, anxiety, depression, diarrhea, puking, insomnia, fatigue, and the CRAVINGS. I'd get decent cravings when going through benzo withdrawals, but they were pretty easily alleviated if I just used soma or pregabalin. Whereas there's nothing that can really subside the cravings I get for opiates. It feels like nothing else matters at the time. 

I'm 9 days completely tapered off benzos for the first time in 6 years, and I have no cravings for the stuff. I rarely think about it, and when I do it's just me being happy that I don't have to use the crap anymore. ",115

Not everyone’s recovery looks the same. Some people thrive on MAT, others don’t. That doesn’t make their story less valid.

I get the mindset, I think, rip the bandaid off, suffer through it, earn your stripes. But I honestly don’t understand why you’d want to go full CT when your body and brain are already completely wrecked from opiates.

Like… you're already sleep-deprived, depressed, in pain, dopamine’s on vacation, your nervous system’s fried..Why make it harder than it already is?

I'm not talking about going on MAT or trading one thing for another. I'm just asking:
Is there any real benefit to making it as brutal as possible?
What’s the upside?

Is it about pride? Feeling “cleaner”? Punishment?
Or is it just not knowing there are other ways?

Not saying CT doesn’t work. I know it does for some.
But if you're already mentally and physically hanging by a thread… why add gasoline to the fire?

Genuinely asking out of interest.
Maybe there’s something I’m missing. Not here to argue! Just trying to understand what drives people to choose CT over other options.





Just to be clear this post wasn’t about sharing my story, I was just curious how people did it cold turkey (no MAT, no kratom, no psilocybin).

I personally used kratom, psilocybin and other natural supplements and vitamins to get off oxy, heroin and benzos, so I’m not claiming I did it without help.

I’m almost 14 months clean now and don’t use anything anymore — just smoke some weed and trip on shrooms 2–3 times a year.
Feel free to keep sharing your experiences! some of them are mind blowing!

I just want wanted to write to you all.

I am 14 years clean today. I have no one to tell, because no one in my life really knows I ever used. I did heroin for 3 years, averaged a gram and half a day, IV. This was right before fentanyl came into the scene.

I quit cold turkey one day. I laid in my mom’s bed for days, the bone pain and restless legs is what I remember most. My hair was matted by the end of it, I ended up hospitalized later in the month due to some electrolyte problems.  I never went on mat medicine.  I understand some need it, but I didn’t want to have to get off something else.

I’ve never relapsed. I left everyone I knew in that scene behind. I became friends with people who didn’t do hard drugs (I didn’t think that was possible). My life is just a life, nothing special. I never went back to college. I’m doing okay. I still have dreams that I use once or twice a year, but it’s fine.

I guess what I’m saying is, keep going if you’re struggling. My life is so much better not feeling sick every other day because the dealer is out or worrying where I’ll get my stuff from . That alone keeps me clean, that was the worst experience in my life.

Do better. I just read through ALL the subreddit rules again, and I STILL cannot understand how or why these posts are deleted by the moderators.

I (24f) am 6 months sober after 5 years of opiate use and 4+ years of addiction prior to that. I’m so jealous of people who've built a beautiful little life for themselves with friends they love and have known for years and full of things they love doing and a sense of home and community and wonder. Who know what they like to do for fun and see people regularly that they know and care about. Have passions and interests and goals and plans for the future and what they want to do even if that's just more of whatever little things they enjoy. 

I feel so lost, I don’t have anything I like in my life and have wasted so many years losing any kind of joy and now I just have to be here??? And figure it out??? Find shit that l like doing when I've spent so long hating everything and doing nothing and talking to no one?? I've ruined like 95% of the relationships and opportunities l've had and I just have to start from scratch now? So many other people who did drugs that Ive talked to at least had something to go back to in their life.

what am I supposed to do with all this nothing???? I am so full of nothing and my life is full of nothing and I can't stop doing nothing and wanting nothing. Like great now I want more in theory, but what does that do for me right now besides make it more painful to have nothing??? And I don't enjoy anything. I can't think of anything I want to actually do. I give myself a goal and I get there and it's like- great, now what? It doesn't mean anything. I'm completely alone and I don't care. Why should I care about my life marginally improving when there's no one to share it with and it feels completely meaningless.

I think of my future and it's like this- I could go finish high school/get my ged, go to college, move away, but I don't actually find any hope in the idea. Then I'd just be in school, still hopeless. I'd just be somewhere else, still me, life still bleak. I got my drivers license finally, got promoted, am trying to talk to people more, make an effort, reach out- but it all feels so empty and trite. It doesn't mean anything to me, I can't connect with anyone, I don't know anyone. When I talk to people it's forced. I don't have anyone I speak candidly with. it's going to take so much work and I don't have the energy, yeah I know I can eventually get there but what am I supposed to do until then and how long exactly is it going to take?
I don’t really fully believe it’s possible for me. I’ve always struggled with or had complicated relationships with people, I’ve been mentally ill since I was a young teenager, and I’ve never gotten over anything that’s ever happened in my life, and now all of a sudden I’m an adult who can’t cope without hard drugs, flooded with everything I never dealt with and this horrible constant void of loss in my chest, with absolutely nothing to look forward to, no light at the end of the tunnel. 

Most people my age still talk to their high school friends, have connections to the world- I know I’m young, but I feel so old. I’ve wasted my whole life so far and have no idea how to pick up the pieces and move forward when I’m so painfully ill equipped and behind compared to my peers. The last time I was sober this long I was a child. I have no idea how to mourn the loss of an adolescence I barely remember and accept that I’m an adult I don’t even recognize with apparently no capacity for joy. Everyday I feel lost and confused, I don’t feel real. I’ve spent so long closing my eyes and standing still that I have no idea how to move forward or live my life, and any time I do make a change I can recognize, it’s terrifying and I want to run back to the safety of stagnancy. 

The only thing that gets me through the day is living in fantasies of the past that can never happen. I don’t want to be so old at 24 and so young somehow, too. The grief of who I was and could have been, and the friends I’ve lost to overdose, or to my own poor choices, the things I saw and experienced so young, it’s unbearable and I have the emotional regulation skills of a 14 year old. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m in therapy, I’m on medication, I go to meetings, I’m even trying to exercise and take supplements. I hate taking care of myself, I want to be better but I hate everything that gets me there. I don’t want to white knuckle my way through life. I’m tired of being alone with all my nothing. How can I dig myself out of this?? Or at least get out of my own way??",45

73,1lovska,For the addict still battling ...,4twenty4life77,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1lovska/for_the_addict_still_battling/,"🌅 HOPE FOR EVERY ADDICT STILL FIGHTING 🌅

To every addict and recovering addict out there—especially those battling opiates—this message is for YOU.

No two paths to recovery look the same. Some of us fall a hundred times before we ever get back up. Some lose everything before they find their reason to fight. But no matter how deep the hole you're in, recovery is possible.

You don’t have to do it perfectly. You don’t have to have all the answers. You just have to take the next step… and then the one after that.

You are NOT too far gone.
You are NOT hopeless.
You are NOT broken beyond repair.

You are stronger than you know, more worthy than you believe, and capable of change beyond your imagination.

I’ve been through the fire. I know what it's like to feel like you’ll never make it out. But I’m almost 5 years clean now...

When you’re ready—truly ready—to stop using, your healing will begin. And with every day clean, you’ll remember what it feels like to be alive again.

Keep going. You’re not alone. And you’re not weak for struggling—you’re powerful for continuing to try.

✊ You’re worthy of recovery.
❤️ You’re worthy of love.
🌟 And your life is not over—it’s just beginning.

Took some advice I saw here and booked a QuickMD appointment and just had the worst experience ever. I guess I’ve been lucky because my old doctor was so kind and understanding- I really felt heard when I spoke and truly felt like he cared about my well being. This QuickMD doctor didn’t even treat me like I was a human- first off only part of her face was even in the frame which I thought was odd, she was immediately rude to me for no reason, had no interest in what I had to say when trying to explain what has been going on and what meds have helped me in the past. Kept sighing when I’d ask a question as if I were wasting her time and her answers were so condescending and short. She was just so cold and uncaring I don’t understand why a Dr who was on an app specifically for prescribing suboxone would treat a new patient like this right off the bat




Writing this out now it doesn’t even sound that bad, I wish I were better at describing the attitude of this doctor and how awful she was- I’ve never been made to feel so small by a doctor before and it just made me feel really sad. I don’t even know why I’m posting this, I guess i just have no one else to talk to about something like getting off drugs that’s so hard already, and then feeling so dismissed by someone who was supposed to help.

76,1je6nnc,A junkie's creed,[deleted],37,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1je6nnc/a_junkies_creed/,"I've spent probably 14 years of my life off and on opiates and I'm on a low dose maintaience now. I'll never forget being almost a year clean when i read a post, I think on reddit from someone who was years clean, almost a decade.

 It started like a speech from a speaker in NA. Very anti-addiction, hopeful, and grateful, then slowly crept into territory of realism, and finally collapsed into a full blown love letter to Heroin, like an ex-lover from your 20 somethings you thought would be the one, and you've since ""moved on"". Have a wife and kids, or vice-versa, yet that memory still lingers and the slow crawl and simple pleasures of life don't seem to scratch that same itch. This person literally went from saying they were so glad to be clean, and ended the post by saying they might go cop literally at that moment. 

It was pretty heartbreaking to read because it really made me wonder, if this person is still feeling this way after almost a decade clean, will I ever not at least, kinda miss opiates? That was when I was about 22-23 and I'm 33 now. What the fuck man, lol. 

I say all this to say that I think the hardest part of giving up opiates is the realism that as far as knew. When I was maintaining, not obliterated, and not sick, just a happy medium between, and usually when I first relapse, people gravitate toward me, and the opiates make it very easy for all the awkwardness of social interactions to fade and transform into opportunities for friendship and even romance. Of course, to keep up with this long term becomes even more difficult though. 

It makes me feel like it's a double edged sword because opiates aren't like alcohol where people can clearly see you're under the influence and so they disregard the vibe your putting out. Opiates hijack the endorphin system and work behind the scenes to manufactor what appears to everyone else like genuine love, happiness, and desire. So long as you don't take it too far and look like an actual junkie or the people interacting with you don't know the telltale signs, but even then they'll tend to want to believe in that portrayal. 

The hardest part of being a junkie wasn't/isn't the maintaience of it. It's being comfortable and instantly in control of how you feel or need to feel, in any given situation, while watching the rest of the world chase the thing you have complete control over. It's like that monolouge in Trainspotting when he lists off all the things ""normal"" people chase. And in the end we're all chasing the same feeling, junkies just found a shortcut to that feeling. 

I'm not saying it's smart or right, we risk death, isolation, and suffering worse than death. No matter how on top of it we'd like to think we are and i realize that after 14 years with each year getting more out of control quality, price, and potency wise. 

Who knows maybe it's a different life for a junkie in somewhere where you can literally just buy pure, pharmacy grade opiates legally. I'd imagine so, but maybe that access would just make it worse since we all crave the control, and limitless control would probably not end too well, but i guess who knows. 

I'm kind of just rambling around the point though..

The point of this is, i got to a point in the past 3 years where I just felt like. Well..maybe this is my purpose in life..to be an example and a voice of reason, even if I can't help myself, maybe i can help people around me, and reason with them. After all I'm living proof, if you can't listen to me, then who tf are you gonna listen to? You're not gonna listen to people in sobriety, and you're not gonna hear out the people who've never lived it. I was content with that for a while, but in the winter it would get pretty lonely. And finally the few people in my family that still cared smacked me with reality and no amount of dope would block the pain of that dissapointment. 

It makes me look back at everything I just wrote and think.. Who tf do I think I am? Jesus or something? Lol. I probably felt like a god on opiates but in all reality was I ever really perceived like I felt I was? Was it even the opiates to begin with, or was it just my excuse to be comfortable with who I really am to begin with? Do I have am endorphin deficiency naturally? Wtf even is normal? Do normal people feel like how I did on opiates or am I just not content with feeling how normal people feel? So many questions dude...lol. 

BTW, I'm on 4mgs of methadone daily now, so idk I guess I'm just trying to confront myself and my addiction and really get to the root of everything. Trying to find a way to reclaim the life I built on opiates..without opiates. But every junkies just addicted to themselves technically and metaphorically. We're not addicted to ""opiates"" we're addicted to endorphins. We're addicted to love, happiness. Isn't everyone? Or...are they not? 

Fucking life man, what a contradicting ride it is lol",40
77,1ien71u,Feeling sorry for yourself.,Rurfy_The_Riftdog,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1ien71u/feeling_sorry_for_yourself/,"Try not to get so paralyzingly hung up on wasted time, missed opportunities, regrets and the like.

If you are an addict, it is almost certain that you have essentially thrown away some significant portion or aspect of your life. Wasted something that you will never get back. I also wouldn't be surprised if that thing you wasted ended up being something incredibly precious to you, and the thought of that loss is soul crushingly difficult to cope with psychologically. It sucks.

Don't get me wrong. Regret is important. It serves a logical evolutionary purpose. It is a powerful indicator that is easily remembered. A quick reference alarm for you to use in the future to avoid the regretful mistake a second time. But we're addicts. I don't think it's a stretch to say we tend to take things to extremes. To excess. 

Regret is worthless to you if you wallow in it. Just like with our addictions, too much of something is almost always horrible. Every day you spend feeling sorry for yourself is another wasted day. Another day to Regret later. 

Do you want to come to the end of your life regretting the fact that you spent your entire life regretting all the things you fucked up? I certainly don't. I'll keep my Regret, but I'm going to use it to my advantage, not my detriment. I hope you do too.

Does anyone have any particular regrets that they've had a very difficult time coming to terms with? Something that just needles you whenever you have a quiet moment alone? I love to hear about some of the things you guys are dealing with and what it has taught you. ",17

But the last few times I kicked, I noticed that at some point (or several points) during the process, I’m overcome with a sense of hopefulness/contentment/appreciation of the most minuscule beauties of life. I can only think to compare it to a profound realization that comes over you during an influential psychedelic experience. Sure my stomach’s in knots, I have a full body sweat/shiver going, but ya know… I think everything is gonna work out just fine. I know this feeling won’t last forever (or could it?). But it’s oddly cathartic and I never notice anyone else mentioning this. 

My best theory is that it’s simply because my emotions are finally being let free after being dulled for so long. Music hits so much different. Just appreciation for life in general. another chance to become a better version of myself grateful for this life and despite the hell addiction has put me and so many others thru, i genuinely believe i needed to experience it in order to truly appreciate what i do have, including the power to become any version of myself that i choose, provided i put in the required work. 

Anyways sorry for rambling. I’m about two days into my detox from heroin, using 7oh and alprazolam sparingly to make it possible to make it thru the last two days of work. I know it’s going to get worse before it gets better but I wish everyone the best in their journey of life, and hope you realize how much potential you truly have at any given moment. Much love!",29

The clock strikes three, the world's asleep,
Yet here I lie, the cravings creep.
A whisper calls, a ghostly pull,
That old dark hunger, never full.

Four long years, I've walked this line,
No pill, no high, just heart and mind.
I fight the urge, I stand up tall,
I won’t go back—I’ve seen it all.

For me, I stay, I choose the light,
Through every storm, through every fight.
But there’s a fire that burns so bright—
Her name is River, my guiding light.

Her laughter lifts me when I fall,
Her tiny voice, my wake-up call.
With little hands, she holds my heart,
Reminding me I’ve come too far.

And then there’s you, my love long gone,
Crystal, lost but never gone.
I swore I’d rise, I'd break the chain,
To honor you, to bear the pain.

Some nights are good, some nights are war,
But I won’t knock on death’s old door.
NA gave me tools to fight,
I use them all, I hold on tight.

I walk with God, He leads my way,
Without His love, I'd fade away.
Now passion fuels the steps I take,
To help the lost, to heal, to break—

The chains of others, just like me,
To show them there’s a way to be.
So when the cravings start to bite,
I pray, I stand—I win the night.

normally i would call my guy, but i moved and changed numbers when i got clean, so there is no guy for me to call (which is for the best). however, i live 15 mins from one of the largest open air markets on the east coast / mid atlantic. i hopped in my car and drove to the city. the whole drive there i felt guilty and gross. but i ignored those feeling and pushed forward. i drove down the main stretch and turned down the side streets however no one was posted, cops were out in full force (an officer was murdered a week ago).


with no luck finding anyone and the guilt getting stronger, i decided to turn around and head home.  i couldn't stop thinking about getting jammed up by the cops, how bad i used to look from picking my face tweaked out on rock...how paranoid and schizophrenic it made me feel...before hoping on the highway i stopped at a corner store and parked up with no plan in mind. 

this ""down on his luck"" looking dude walked up to my window and asked me if i could buy him a soda and some blunt wraps. so i did, i don't mind helping someone out. when he came out i asked him if he knew where i could score a 20 of rock. he knew a spot..he told me he was gonna run to the house across the street and grab it, and he would be right back. he didn't ask for my money, he just told me to wait. after he walked away a cop pulled in and parked next to me, cop ignored me and ran into the store. 

i left immediately and drove home. i took the cop arriving as a sign to not go thru with the deal. by that point the guilt and self hatred had filled my body.

i'm currently sitting in a wawa parking lot typing this before i spend that $20 on dinner. 

idk who is going to read this but thank you for letting me vent to you. i don't have anybody in my personal life who i can tell this to and keeping it inside makes me feel worse. i live alone with my dog and have virtually 0 friends, and currently can't afford therapy yet. typing this out makes me feel a little better. love you all thank you for reading my message as i try to work thru these feelings",31

I won't say this is a success story because it's ongoing and mainly I don't want to get too cocky, but we should celebrate every minute we're clean.

I think I'm grieving everything I've ever felt in my brain that made me content. I don't even know what I'm trying to say anymore. I just want to be happy, and I want to feel like myself. Everyone is so happy for me for finally breaking my addiction and so happy that I am no longer in withdrawal. I feel empty though, like I don't have the ability to be happy.

I couldn’t get RX filled earlier this year as they were out everywhere local to me & had to go off them cold turkey. The withdrawals were awful but I didn’t realize how bad my mental health would be for the next 5 months. I am now 6 months out without any opiates and am finding joy in my life again.

91,1iw5bsa,Running out of pills - was going to buy more but just stumbled into this sub and decided that I’m going to quit instead,RainbowBlak,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1iw5bsa/running_out_of_pills_was_going_to_buy_more_but/,"10 years ago, I (f, at the time 23) was prescribed a repeat script for codeine due to back pain. This marked the start of a decade long battle with opioid addiction. The script was stopped cold turkey about 18 months later but by that time I was already deep into addiction territory. I have stopped/started over the years but never really had any inclination to fully quit. About a year ago, I moved onto dihydrocodeine, which I buy from an online pharmacy. I go through withdrawal hell every single month due to the restrictions they place on ordering, and I hate it. I receive a monthly prescription of Gabapentin for genuine nerve damage and I always take them too fast in order to enhance the high from the pills, then I leave myself to suffer the nerve pain for the rest of the month, which also sucks. 

I am down to my last few dihydrocodeine pills and my plan was as follows - 2 this morning, 2 this evening, then 3 tomorrow morning as a “treat” because tomorrow is my birthday, then I’m out until I can re-order. I’m already experiencing some withdrawals due to the dosage decrease but I know they will hit full force once I fully run out. After I post this, I’m going to email the online pharmacy I purchase them from and ask them to disable my account. 

About an hour ago I found this sub and out of curiosity read a couple of posts. A couple turned into a few more, then a few more and now I’m sat here re-evaluating my whole life. Reading the heart-warming, inspiring journeys from those of you who have quit (and those of you who are in the process of doing so) has been nothing short of an epiphany for me. I’ve realised that I don’t want to spend my life in a cycle of opiate abuse and withdrawal. I don’t want to feel like the only way I can feel happy and experience joy is by chemically altering my brain. I don’t want to find out that a friend has recently been prescribed some opiates for a genuine medical reason, then spend the rest of my day subtly mentioning this “pain” I’ve been having in a way to build up to asking for some 😭 

I have a little girl who deserves a mum that doesn’t cycle through phases of being energetic/happy/full of life to fatigued/irritible/feeling ill each month. 

I will have to do this on my own as my husband and family have no idea about my addiction. I have been hiding this for 10 years, which has been stressful in itself, and also something that my husband does not deserve. 

I know that there will be 1000’s of tips if I search this sub, but if anyone wants to drop them here too I would be grateful. Saying that - one of the most irritating (but not worst) withdrawal symptoms I always face is a runny nose. Is there anything that helps with this? 

Anyway, I know that in terms of addictions, mine is on the milder end of the opiate spectrum, but it has been hell for me nonetheless. So, from the bottom of my heart I want to say thank you to each and every one of you. You are all inspirational and without this sub I’m not sure I would have ever reached this decision. I’ve honestly never felt determination like it. I know it won’t be easy, and there will probably be setbacks and road bumps along the way, but I really don’t want to live like this anymore. 

Good luck to those of you on your own journeys to sobriety and a huge well done to those of you who have already reached it. Love to you all 🩷

92,1iq46sw,I can’t cope being sober,Soft_Operation3953,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1iq46sw/i_cant_cope_being_sober/,"I’m 21m, I got out of rehab 2 months ago for a 2 year oxy, benzo and tramadol habit, that was on  and off but kept getting progressively worse up to about 70mg oxy a day and various benzos. I came out of rehab with the mindset that I want to to give sobriety a go and obtain full abstinence from all mind/mood altering substances. Not even 2 weeks out I picked up Kratom. Then found some sleeping pills, started taking those, then started having the odd drink out. All while living with my parents telling them I’m sober. Then I picked up pregablin and got caught the next day. Now it’s been a month since then and my life is coming together, I’m back in the gym, running, got a job, starting my last year of varsity. But my emotional regulation is fucked, and I’m still using sleeping pills, Ritalin and had 1 relapse on oxy. 

There are days like today where I feel immense sadness, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, and all I want to do is use oxy. I think the only thing that’s stopping me, is the fact that I live with my parents. I know that if I was left to my own devices, I would have picked up ages ago. I dont want to be feel this way, I don’t want to use oxy and fuck my life up more. But I feel so overwhelmed by everything and just want it all to go away, and feel safe. Don’t get me wrong there are good days sober, but the bad, are really bad. And I see no way or point to carry on with life without using. I feel lonely, my confidence is shattered, I don’t have many friends that I can see, my gf broke up with me whilst I was in rehab, I’m yearning for connection. 

I don’t know how to navigate this, I know intellectually getting sober is the right thing to do, and I want to. But emotionally I cant win. Life feels too hard sober, and I ask myself, what’s the point. 

Anyways there my vent, hope you can relate Please please please, don’t use opiates if you haven’t already, they will flip your life upside down forever, within the blink of an eye. ",49

I’m 20 years old and currently 8 days clean from opiates. I’ve been in a clinic and I’m doing my best to rebuild my life and get through this.

I wanted to ask: when do the withdrawal symptoms and mental pain start to ease up? I’ve read a lot of posts saying things get better after about two weeks is that really the case?

Right now I’m on pregabalin, and while I was in the clinic they also gave me Valium to help with sleep, since I’ve had severe sleep problems ever since I was a kid. Sleep is still rough, but maybe slightly better than it was.

Yesterday I forced myself to go outside, get some sunlight and move a bit. It wasn’t easy, but I think it helped. Should I be pushing myself to do that more often, even when everything in me wants to stay inside?

I’d really appreciate any advice or hearing how things went for others around this point in recovery. Thanks for reading.",65

It was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done both physically and mentally. For a while, I actually felt free. I was clean. I thought I was finally done with this cycle.
But about three weeks ago, I slipped. I fell back into daily heroin use. At the same time, I started a new job, trying to hold things together on the outside while everything inside me started to fall apart again.

Now I feel stuck. I don’t want to go back on methadone it messed me up physically, and I promised myself I wouldn’t return to it. But I also can’t keep doing this. I’m tired. I’m scared of spiraling deeper, and I’m not sure how to break this pattern again

I’m sharing this not for sympathy, but because hiding it only feeds the shame. If you’ve been here too if you’ve relapsed, if you’ve felt hopeless, if you’ve gotten clean and then lost your grip I want you to know you’re not alone. I’m still trying. I’m not giving up. I just don’t know what the next step is right now.

the day before I hit CT WD I smoked nearly a quarter in one day. It was 
getting fucking ridiculous!

her to cancel my Oxycodone script. It’s gonna be hard after having free Oxy

wake up a little better each day.

I'm so proud of myself for getting on MAT and getting my life back together.

  
Last year, my account would have shown around -$800. Yes, negative. Since I get weekly direct deposits, my bank would allow me to overdraft up to $800 on my account. As I'm sure you can guess, this was awful and left me in and endless cycle of overdraft fees and debt. I would get my weekly pay (roughly 1k USD) and since I was so in the red, I'd end up with about $150 - which would right away go to my dealer. Then I'd spend the rest of the week trying to scheme some money until payday. I make $77k a year but was always broke and scrounging around my car for change to put some gas in.

  
My bank also has an get your pay early feature. Only issue is, it wouldn't always be early. Sometimes I'd get paid Wednesday, sometimes Friday. So you can imagine how it felt when it wouldn't come Wednesday.

  
I've been on MAT since December of 2024 and I can honestly say it changed my life. There was always a stigma when I'd ask about MAT, usually something along the lines of 'you're just getting addicted to something else!'. However, if you're already addicted to fent/blues, what's it matter? At least this way you're not waiting 45 minutes in a sketchy neighborhood getting 'im around the corner' texts. You're not worried about where you'll get your next high. You're not worried about getting some bunk shit, spending all your money, and still being sick. In my experience, I haven't had a single negative effect from the Methadone!

  
I went from spending up to $300 a day on blues to now getting bi-weekly takehomes and only paying $55 a week. It's truly changed me as a person and helped me develop better habits. Getting high or getting sick is no longer on my mind. 

I'm able to be present for my beautiful girlfriend and my awesome dog. I'm able to give them anything they want, whenever they want! I'm able to setup all my bills on auto-pay! I'm able to save money! I'm able to get anything I want!

104,1j8lk4n,12 Years of Heroin Addiction: My Journey to Recovery and a New Life,[deleted],32,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1j8lk4n/12_years_of_heroin_addiction_my_journey_to/,"Hello everyone. I’ve been on this sub for a month, and I’ve read some stories that have really touched me. Every time I read your stories, I see myself reflected in them in some way. Deep down, I believe that we, the addicts of the world, form a kind of brotherhood

Today, I want to share my story. I hope that someone can relate to it or that it helps someone make the decision to quit drugs. If it helps even one person, that will be enough for me.

The first time I smoked heroin was one night in early summer 2008. I was struggling with depression, tired of not having any excitement in life. It was a conscious decision. I was 22 years old, freshly graduated from university, and I didn’t know what to do with my life. My friends were starting to build something meaningful with their lives and were drifting away from me. And on top of that, my girlfriend had left me for another guy (I don’t blame her—the other guy was simply better than me, and she was very considerate, trying to make sure the breakup didn’t affect me psychologically). I felt very lonely and miserable. I had tried other drugs before—mainly cocaine and speed—but I hadn’t gotten hooked on any of them. However, I knew heroin was different. I knew it even before I started using it.

It was easy to get started. I just went to the neighborhood in my city where I knew drugs were sold, bought some, and used it right there in the same house. A girl who was using there guided me through the process of preparing the drug. Later, we became friends. I liked the feeling I got from heroin (I’m not going to go into more detail here). The next day, I woke up at noon, and the first thing I thought about was going to buy more. I remember being fully aware that if I gave in, I would fall into a deep, dark pit with no easy way out. I held out until 3 in the afternoon, and at that hour—during the hottest part of the day, in the hottest summer on record in my area at the time—with my body and mind sluggish from the sun and the scorching air, I thought, ‘Screw it,’ and got dressed to go buy more.

What followed, for twelve incredibly long years, was exactly what I expected—the full package. A series of highs, withdrawals, escapes, struggles, misery, happiness, sadness, absolute depression… A total chaos of emotions and experiences: car accidents, hospital admissions, family gatherings ending in tears, stealing from my parents, getting fired from one job after another… Summarizing those 12 years in a single paragraph feels so surreal. Every day without drugs was like an entire lifetime—it was as if my life was on pause and wouldn’t resume until I got my dose. Everything revolved around heroin. I would sit down to watch a TV show, and my mind would be focused on getting drugs. I’d go to work and only think about finishing my shift so I could go buy some (some days, I even smoked at work). Then, when I used, I felt completely guilty and miserable. Many times, I didn’t even get high—I just did it to feel physically okay.

Luckily, I managed to hold up physically. I put my body through infinite stress from cycles of use and withdrawal, from which I’ve fortunately come out relatively intact. But psychologically, I ended up devastated. It wasn’t until 2020 that I finally managed to detox completely.

I have to say that at no point during those 12 years did I feel like a victim. I suffered a lot, I regretted starting, of course—I cried rivers of tears—but I knew that I and only I had chosen that path. And I had done it with full knowledge of my actions.

Today, I’ve rebuilt my life. I’m far away from drugs (my only current vice is vaping, and I’ve also quit drinking alcohol). I live alone with my cat, and I have a good job. What I went through during all those years now feels very distant, yet at the same time, it’s as if it all happened just yesterday. I don’t let my guard down—I’m still very afraid of relapsing, but for now, I don’t think that will happen, even though I still have bad days. I feel like I’ve lost 12 years of my life, my entire youth, and that I’ve become a more cynical and less joyful person. I’ll probably never get those years back, but I’m okay with that. Thanks to my psychologist, I’ve managed to make peace with myself, and my parents have forgiven me for everything I did, but I’m still very hard on myself for some of the things I did. I still have work to do moving forward. But that’s okay—I have the strength to do it.

If you have read this far, thanks!. I don’t care where you’re from—whether it’s the USA, Europe, Australia, Pakistan, or anywhere else—you're important to me. I apologize if I’ve made any grammatical mistakes—English is not my native language (I’m from Spain), and although I speak some English, given how long this text is, I translated it using AI.

Lastly, I hope all of you manage to break free from drugs. Living without them is worth it, even though the fight is so hard.

Greetings to you all.",11

I keep wondering what was so wrong with me that I didn’t have what many other addicts have. I had no one cheering for me on the sidelines. I keep seeing stories of grieving spouses who lost their husbands/wives/partners to addiction and I wonder why they were lovable but I wasn’t.

It's honestly what's probably kept me alive and off street drugs. I've been using oxy on and off since 17, I'm 32 now. Damn near half my life. I've gone CT, I've done rapid sub tapers, used kratom. Always ended up back at mom's. Even tho I asked her to help me stop, I charmed and lied that I had control and the cycle would start all over. At my worst I was 300-400 MG of oxy a day. This last bid was up to aboit 180 daily. I'm on day 4 of a bit C megadose protocol, works okay. But I'm quite over this shit. Last year my mom move din with me and my fiance right before we found pit we were prego. I was clean at the time. Didn't take long until I was in active addiction again. I caught myself pretty quickly and told her if she gives me any more pills I'm kicking her out. Fast forward and my son has arrived, life is wonderful. I have a slip and ask again. Sure enough she gave me some. I kept it to weekend Ms for a while pre usual and eventually everyday again. You know how it goes. We'll I don't have the heart to kick her out and had another convoy with her how I really need to stay clean from these things and I need support from my parent. Not a dealer. But the real problem is me. I always convince her I'm fine Yada Yada.. Then I lie and say there for others and just use my money to pay for them. It's me I'm the problem. Im going to do something different and actually commit to meetings and a program. It's the only way. I gotta change something, because what I've do e in the past isn't working. I've had long stints (2 years, a few 8-9 months) of not blowing pills. But I'd drink heavy, or drink and do blow, last time was kratom. Not really sober. This time I'm going all in.

112,1i0nzhv,One week sober ,[deleted],29,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1i0nzhv/one_week_sober/,"For the first time in three years of taking opiates daily, I’ve made it through an entire week sober. It’s a milestone I never thought I’d hit, and I’ve been reading so many stories on this sub, both inspiring and heartbreaking but that has been a huge source of motivation for me.

I know my story isn’t unique. I’m in the same position as millions of others, I have a good life. No one knows about my addiction, but it’s been quietly tearing my life apart. Over the years, I’ve withdrawn from friends and family, stopped going out, and became a shell of myself. The changes were gradual, so subtle that people around me didn’t notice.

Last year was the worst for me. I isolated myself almost completely. Even when I did see people, I couldn’t wait to get back home. My entire life revolved around finding, stocking, and planning for these pills. I didn’t see myself as an addict but just as someone who needed them, like anti depressants. I didn’t want to post here until I had something to show for it or until I could say I’d made real progress.

Now, after just one week sober, I’m starting to feel like myself again. I know it’s still very early, but I’m feeling back to myself. 

I know this isn’t the kind of post that’s interesting—no robberies, no dramatic rock bottom. But I think that’s the point. Most addicts aren’t the stereotype we think of. Many of us live in nice homes, hold good jobs, and keep up appearances. We don’t talk about it because of the embarrassment,  (that’s why I’m here and not telling my family) and because we don’t see ourselves in the public perception of what “an addict” looks like. 

Right now my life is saveable but if I lost my job and family, there’ll be no reason for me to get sober. So I hope someone who’s going down a same path makes the decision now before it gets worse.

We’re missing the bridge to treatment, and it’s costing lives",HexMarine,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1ox197c/narcan_saves_people_but_fentanyl_kills_them_again/,"Narcan saves lives, but fentanyl is killing people again in the hours and days after they’re revived. That “post-overdose window” is the most dangerous part of the entire crisis, and right now there is zero medical tool designed for it.

Clinics can start someone on Suboxone, but only after withdrawal begins. With fentanyl, that can take 24–72 hours. If you start too soon, you trigger violent precipitated withdrawal. It’s not a failure of Suboxone — it’s a timing problem the system has never solved.

And this is where people die. They walk out of the ER or away from EMS, use again to feel normal, and overdose a second time. It’s the deadliest 48-hour period in modern public health.

What’s missing is a bridge between Narcan and treatment.

We need a field-ready, fentanyl-safe buprenorphine induction device that lets EMS, clinics, or outreach teams slowly microdose buprenorphine in a way that doesn’t trigger precipitated withdrawal. The science already exists. The delivery technology already exists. This is not futuristic. It’s just unbuilt.

The only reason it doesn’t exist is the same reason Narcan almost didn’t:
there’s no immediate profit in building it. Once the public demanded Narcan as a necessity, companies found a way to make it. The same could be true here.

This device would stabilize people right after overdose — the exact moment they are most likely to die — and give them a safe path into actual treatment.

We talk a lot about the opioid crisis, but nobody is talking about this missing tool.
If we’re serious about saving lives in the fentanyl era, this has to be part of the conversation.

I just got kicked out of trying to bribe them for another night. I demand you give me a free room as I enter the lobby with a bed bug in a cigarette plastic. Plus, it was still alive. Look at these bites as I take my shirt off in front of them. Scores of them all down my side. Look! “The manager says sir we found needles in your room after we switched you the night before and gave you a free room.” “So what I’m a fucking diabetic, I’m going to sue your asses” the dude scoffs and says “your insulin is heroin? There was blood in the needle not to mention the cigarette butt cottons”. 

Fuck fuck, I stormed out the door and grabbed my 3 trash bags of my clothes and everything I owned. Frail and dopesick I carry them across the street. My bowels were turning into whatever the fuck that volcano’s name is in Hawaii, where I first started using needles. I throw my bags in some bushes next to a carmax. Relieve myself. I look around and see some cardboard where a fellow heroin consumer musta have slept with ants and old clothes. I fall upon my sweet sweet heroin King mattress. I’m really sick. I’m dying I kept repeating “fuck” was used probably 600 times that day.

As long as I got my dope. Fuck this left my bags halfway in a bush behind a Del Taco and ran. Checked my phone and he said room 191.

Louder knocks…he texts come back in 30 I’ll have a shot ready my dealer is in here he doesn’t like you. Fucking flaco. 2 hours later I’m shivering behind a dumpster. He texts “cruise up”. Thank fuck. I run like junkie Gump. Bang bang, he opens. “Wtf man” I moan smacking my arm. He is loaded and passed out. “Nodded out lol, here” he handed me a pre-loaded rig. “You gotta go he’s coming back.” Fuck fuck fuck…. I run down stairs

I ran back to Del Taco where my bags were at and used a token for the bathroom and had to order a 39c taco. I roll my sweater up and had no veins. Fuck. I was dehydrated. Did push-ups. Nothing. fuck. Okay, let’s go poking. Finally, I managed to find a vein, and I missed half the shot. Fuck it, snot dried up stomach cramps gone. Eyes dried up.

117,1nc5elj,About to hit 1 month clean from 400-600mg of oxy a day (cold turkey),[deleted],28,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1nc5elj/about_to_hit_1_month_clean_from_400600mg_of_oxy_a/,"About to be 1 month clean from roughly 400-600mgs of oxycodone a day. I was desperate to quit for months as it was destroying my relationship and my work and was no longer fun to use, it was just a weekly tax that stopped me from being sick. I was spending roughly $7000 a month on longtecs and basically stopped me working (self employed) and caring about about anything.

I went completely cold turkey and it was excruciating. I was twitching, sick, not sleeping for the first 5 days. I then bought a few blisters of xanax and managed to knock myself out for a few days. I've been addicted to valium for 10 years but don't ever up my dose. However the xanax gave me painful withdrawals.

I've been through H withdrawal before (smoking it for 4 months) but a year of oxy was 10x worse. However nowhere near as bad as benzo withdrawal which I wouldn't wish on anyone.

2 weeks after stopping was surprised to start getting my energy back and a bit of sleep. I have very little opiate cravings at all. However now close to a month and don't have my appetite back - I've actually lost a lot of weight since stopping.

I've now finally been able to travel again, I was trapped for a year due to the addiction. The best cure imo is leaving all your triggers behind and moving elsewhere. I wiped my phone and cut ties even with close friends which I feel incredibly bad about but will have to explain once I'm sober longer.

I still struggle with alcohol and coke but nothing beats not having to wake up everyday wondering how to score oxy and feel sick of the disgusting amount of money you spend on them.

I work freelance and made some terrible decisions while on oxy, and have come out sober but also minus 500k to almost zero and pretty much rebuilding my financial life / family life again.

There is always hope, I was afraid to ask for help but worked through it with my partner for 2 weeks while sick.

I've been through suboxone detox before but nothing beats the feeling of achievement of stopping cold turkey and dealing with it on your own.

I was searching this sub before I decided to detox, looking for hope so thought I'd leave a note here.

Me and P were super close, we were together pretty much every single day for 6 years, half of high school and all of my college, lived together for a year. After that, i had 2 kids immediately after graduating from college, so i didnt really see him anymore.

P is the child of 2 alcoholic parents, and he got started drinking and smoking really young.  In the years since, hes had about every bad thing happen to him that can happen to someone with a poly drug addiction. His life would fall apart, hed go to rehab, get a job and car and apartment. Then hed go back out, crash the car, lose the job and end up homeless. Like 20 times of that cycle. You guys know how it goes. So the last time he ended up in the hospital with sepsis and multiple infections, mrsa, wounds, the works. He wasnt expected to survive. His mom didnt bother coming around. His dad came by and told him 'looks like youre not going to make it so im going to turn in the plates on your car.' P said ok. Nothing else to say i guess.  Idk why, but that hit me hard. 

So hes made it over 2 years sober now. Hes a carpenter now, works for a builder and hes a foreman. He and his mom bought a townhouse together. Last time i talked to him when right when he got out of the hospital. Hadnt seen him in probably 7 or 8 years.

Hes just such a great person, kind of a space cadet, so funny and under it all just a really caring sweet fun guy. Im just so thankful to see him doing good. I was thinking about it this morning and came to tears, thinking about how his addiction has caused him to suffer all these years. 

I was really thankful to see him. It was so nice to sit down and talk recovery and life with him and our other friend, who doesnt have any addictions, but is as caring and understanding as a 'normie' can be. I dont know why im sharing all this, but i just felt like i needed to. As long as we're alive we still have a shot to recover.",3

Something happened today to make me extremely angry. I work full time and Im not on a bad wage but my god living expenses are so high I feel like I'm in poverty. I lost it for a while.

I can't speak about recovery but it was a total waste of time and money. I literally got zero out of it. No good feeling, nothing at all. I feel guilty for caving but it really showed me how little this drug was doing for me. I got absolutely nothing from it and I don't think I'll be going back any time soon.

I use to see an ambulance reviving someone and I would ask the other users standing around what colour he had used and who had it, then going to get that stuff myself. Anything that had carfentanil was always sought after. So ya ask your Dr about Sublicade today! (Side effects may include release from physical dependency of opiates)

I noticed yoir concern in the comments was about ""accomplishments."" I dont blame you for asking. But accomplishments mean two very different things to me now in sobriety as opposed to being in my addiction. Materials? Career milestones? Financial gain? These are all idolized in the world I was in when I was addicted. They were also all that mattered to the people around me. They determined self-esteem and my personal worth. Ironically, I was an utter, complete piece of dog shit and seemed to have no real grasp of myself.

My brain was running on opiates for 20 yrs. From age 17 to age 37. By 37 I had lost my business. Lost my children. Lost my license. Lost my car. Filed for bankruptcy. I was a convicted felon never to be able to get a job at a McDonald’s, let alone something serious for my age. All relationships were gone. I had stolen from everyone. I had almost died from endocarditis from using IV drugs. My fiancée had died. My little sister had died from fentanyl after I had introduced her to opiates. My mother had turned into a miserable drunk in response.

I had literally no one. I had grown up in a wealthy area in North Florida. All of my friends were Drs and lawyers. I myself was kicked out of law school due to pawning something that turned out to be stolen. And here I was, 37. Unhireable. Not a single human to answer my phone call. Homeless, nowhere to sleep. And btw, I was high at work. Stepped off the ladder the wrong way and was now literally disabled. Completely blew out my ankle. Didn’t get the proper treatment and was now handicapped. I needed crutches to walk. So I’m a crippled homeless man withdrawing from dope and also dying of hepatitis C. I catch a ride to an AA meeting and a girl who knew me from years prior of trying to get clean gave me a hug. I broke down in tears and I asked her to help. That night she connected me with somebody at a sober living place.

If it hasn’t gotten this bad for you yet? Consider yourself lucky.

When I came into AA for the 4th or 5th time, I knew the drill. I knew if I did what a sponsor told me, I would get better. I put my ego aside. I had read enough business books and positive thinking literature to understand the value of a mentor and how his successful patterns would be kinetic. Life is a sum of patterns, habits, right? I’d adopt new ones.

A.A. was culty. I hated the religious aspect of it (or so I thought). And the first step is believing in a power greater than myself. It’s establishing a baseline. A psychological rest stop, a father to hand our problems and our faith over to. Because the hole we dug was high and our shovel was broken. I am so grateful I had had some time during incarceration where I had been connected to something higher than myself. I knew there was something buzzing out there that was real. Reading the Big Book and being able to actually feel something inside as I read certain sections of the book.

I had a ""spiritual experience"" in my past so I knew this is what came with the steps and the process. The thing that helped me this time around was viewing the AA meeting house like a battery. God existed to me at a specific higher frequency. In order to be in tune to His station, I have to maintain a vibration. In my addiction, my vibration was low. Thinking was low. Self-image, mood, aspirations— all of it was low.

So to be in tune with God, I had to plug in and charge up. When I physically could not be there, I had to maintain this vibration with actions, communication, and reading. So an AA meeting would charge me up. Reading the Big Book. Talking to other addicts or alcoholics. And most importantly, calling my sponsor. I had to call him every single day. If I wanted to adopt his life (a happy man with a wife and kids who admired him), then I would need to copy his behaviors.

So I would run my sick and unhealthy thinking through his processor every a.m. And man, for a guy who lost his father at 8 yrs old to drunk driving, having a man I could call for the first time in my life every single day— who would listen to every single one of my problems, bad ideas, and plans— and then he would say, “OK, this is how you should handle this”? That was something I had been missing my entire life that I didn’t realize I needed. It brought a lot of peace and confidence my way.

To make a long story short, I now operate in a different realm. One where “success” is measured by my relationships with other human beings, by love in my heart, and by peace and happiness. Almost 3 yrs later, there is a calm I feel now. It’s unlike anything I ever experienced, even before my addiction. I bootcamped sobriety pretty damn hard my first year. Several meetings a day. And while it’s the toughest and hardest part of getting clean, there is almost something I miss about it— the grind. The struggle. The fire under my ass.

I ended up getting reconstructive surgery on my leg. I started going to the gym for the first time in my life and getting into good shape. I can walk again. No more hepatitis C and a doomed liver. I have my own place. My kids live with me full-time. I have custody back. I’ve built a business that has just blessed me beyond anything I can imagine. I literally built it on crutches with a cellphone in my hand while being broke, newly sober, and sleeping on my grandmother’s couch. And now me and my kids travel all over. We can do whatever we want whenever we want. And the most important thing is we do it all together.

Am I successful? Yes, I’m happy. I’m at peace. People can depend on me. Every morning I wake up, it’s a blessing. It’s a gift that I am excited about taking on. And if you’re asking whether or not you will have this? If it’s too late for you? I’ll tell you no, it’s not too late. And what God has in store for you? You are unable to conceive with your wildest imagination. In 2016, I sat on my bunk bed in a correctional facility reading a page in the Big Book, where it made me a promise to me. When I read it, I got goosebumps. I will never ever forget that moment. Because the promise was big and it was appealing to me. It was what I wanted. And I can tell you, my friend— it came true. I’ll share it with you:

"" Established on such a footing we became less and less interested in ourselves, our little plans and designs. More and more we became interested in seeing what we could contribute to life. As we felt new power flow in, as we enjoyed peace of mind, as we discovered we could face life successfully, as we became conscious of His presence, we began to lose our fear of today, tomorrow or the hereafter. We were reborn.""

129,1jlv4zv,Methadone Stigma,[deleted],28,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1jlv4zv/methadone_stigma/,"I'm just posting this to say that if you've spent years fighting opiate addiction ON and OFF, and feel like there's no way out, and are like I was, completely disregarding maintenence, specifically Methadone or have tried Suboxone and still couldn't stop thinking about Opiates, you really should at least consider methadone. 

I tapered as low as I could stand off Fent, made it to almost nothing, literally grains a day, so small you couldn't even see it, and I still couldn't function so after a few people suggested methadone I finally said fuck it and went to the clinic. I know people who are still on it and some who used it to maintain and regain stability while tapering, but the one thing I feel is important to stress is that IT WORKS.

Stop feeling guilty or like your giving up on sobriety for considering it. If you're on the right dose all it's gonna do is take away cravings, make you feel normal with a bit of pain relief if you have chronic pain outside of withdrawl, and most importantly, keep you from caring about getting high anymore. Your receptors will be satisfied and you'll resume life as a normal, contributing person, capable of going to school, working, forming relationships, etc.

The trick is to be honest with yourself, you'll know if your taking too high or too low of a dose. In the beginning it's crucial to play around with the dose to see what's too low and what's too high. It took me about 2 weeks of starting at 20mgs and going as low as 4mgs for 3 days, 5mgs for another 3, and eventually doubling my take home for 5mgs to realize that 10mgs is my sweet spot.

I just went back to work and didn't miss a beat, and my job is moderately physical and a quick pace is crucial. I'm finishing my GED (last test) in 2 weeks and I was able to keep about 6/10s of my savings that I kept stacking up while on fentynal the past 3 years while planning my escape from fentynal, to use the $ for Tech schhol. 

Truthfully, I don't even hate fentynal  or any opiate. After all these years I finally realize, it was never their fault for the way i am, and it might not even be mine. Without opiates I probably would have killed myself tbh. I wasn't functional day to day, and today I can honestly say methadone makes my life more normal than it's ever been. 

I look forward to each day and don't gamble with my life anymore. Stop being so prideful about sobriety, is my advice. We have no issue with tossing pride and dignity out the window and selling it for a bag when we do fentynal. We said we'd never fo fentynal, remember? We said we'd never do Heroin.. we said we'd never smoke a perc.. said we'd never steal for a habit. Said we'd never be homeless, etc. You get the picture..

""FUCK PRIDE..it ONLY hurts, it NEVER helps"" 

At the very least, try it for a few days and plan a taper. Anything is better than fentynal. Sure heroin is coming back, at least in the NE, but it won't last, and it will be laced with fent still. And goof luck ever affording an oxy habit. Go to the clinic for free, or at a small copay. Even people without insurance pay less for the clinic than they do they're dope habit. 

We're junkies, stop acting like your above maintenence, it's not just about US, we effect the people we love, most of them already consider us dead so that it doesn't hit so hard if we do, and so they can still be excited when they do see us ""oh wow he's not dead yet!"" If you can't do it for yourself, at least do it so your loved ones aren't trapped anymore, it's not fair to them.

Anyway, Just my 3 cents ",29

i just wanted to vent i guess. i feel so frustrated and so angry. i just got married, im trying so hard to build a life this late in my own but i just don’t see it happening anymore. the world i knew is crumbling and it’s looking grim. 

i dunno. like i said, the possibility of relapse is pretty much nil cuz i changed my whole surroundings, but man, it’s so frustrating to gain your life back and watch someone else tear down things and make it harder in the long run. ",37
131,1i1s42z,Reflecting on 6 years ,mirkodup,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1i1s42z/reflecting_on_6_years/,"I used to buy a week's worth at a time.  For those on the East Coast, I would grab 7 bricks, each of which had 5 bundles in them.  I was doing 1 brick a day.  Roughly $100 a day.  This was 6-10 years ago.

There was no better feeling than coming home from a reup knowing I was good for the next 7 days, although it was more like 5 or 6 days because I always messed up and went apeshit at least a couple times during the week and did more than my allocated daily amount.  The comfort of having my drugs and no worries because I made it home safe, didn't get robbed or arrested, and didn't have to go back out there for awhile.

Then around day 4 or 5, the stress and anxiety would start to hit.  All the worrying about where I was getting the money, how much I was spending, all the debt I was in, the places and people I would have to rob next because I NEEDED IT TO SURVIVE.  Hitting up the various plugs, venturing out to P-Town where I had absolutely no business being. I've been shot at, stabbed, done the stabbing, gotten beat up, beat other people up.  Got cheated and hustled and felt truly shocked.  ""How could anyone do this to me"" I always asked myself, obviously forgetting about all the horrible things I would do to secure the drugs. 

I justified it all. I wore a suit and tie everyday to work. A mortgage, car loans, bills.  A wife and kids who I had to support. Mouths to feed. ""Normal"" friends. Absolutely no one would look at me and think JUNKIE.  But I was a junkie of the highest degree.  The biggest scumbag.  A wolf in sheep's clothing. I hid it so well.  Never got caught, never OD'd, my wife and family didn't suspect a thing. I was living a lie, but which life was the lie and which was real? I didn't even know anymore.  Survival mode for years. Locked in and focused on making money, legally and illegally, so I could support the use. 

Trying over and over and over to get clean without admitting to anyone how badly I fucked up.  How could I ever admit something like that? Someone like me being a heroin addict? No fucking way.  I could never take the embarrassment and shame of it all.  What would my wife think? What would my family and friends think of me. They would see the absolute loser I really was and I was never going to let that happen.  Not while I was living anyway.  

I would build up the courage to quit. Brace for the shock of cold turkey withdrawal. Still had to wake up with the kids and get them ready for school.  Still had to go to work.  Still had to coach, go on camping outings and be the perfect husband and father I so foolishly duped myself into believing I was. Throwing up constantly, shitting my ass out, sweating, the body aches and pains, the feeling of NEVER GETTING COMFORTABLE.  The sleepless nights laying next to my wife in bed while she was sleeping. Through sheer white knuckle willpower I tried not to toss and turn... waiting for her to finally go to sleep so I could retreat downstairs and suffer through the night alone. Every night feeling like hours. The dread of dawn coming when the kids would wake up and I would have to face life without drugs.  

This wasn't sustainable.  I would make it 3 or 4 days.. a week tops. I couldn't take more than that.  Behind on work, wife getting concerned that I wasn't getting better from my ""stomach flu"", I had to pick up.  I promised myself a taper, use benzos, use cocaine to come off Heroin.  I tried everything.  Being sober never could actually stick.  How could it?  I was living in my own personal hell.  No one to talk to about it.  Alone in the pit of despair that was my conscious. I cannot describe how it felt. Thoughts of ending myself came often. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy. 

What a fuckin joke it all was. All for what?  So I could be numb for a few fleeting moments.  It didn't even feel good anymore.

This is already longer than it should be so I'll fast forward. After a couple years of the above cycle, I finally got arrested.  I ran out to get pizza for the family and didn't come back.  After hours and hours and hours the police finally let me make a phone call.  I called my wife to come bail be out of jail.  She was worried sick about me.  She thought I died.  I wasn't picking up my phone obviously, the police had it. Like the perfect wife she is, she didn't ask questions. She came straight to the jail and bailed me out.  

The jig was up. I broke down and told her everything. I'll spare you the details but to say she was pissed would be putting it mildly. Rightfully so. 

I was on the brink of losing my wife and kids.  I now had felony charges.  I was facing losing my professional license and my career of 18 years. My employer fired me.  Even with all this, I felt better than I did in years.  I finally could talk to someone about my addiction. The secrets were over! Something I never though was possible.  After opening up to my wife, I told my siblings, my parents, my in laws.  Everyone who was close to me.  And god damn I was never called a loser junkie.  All the fear I had was bullshit.

Finally, after being open and honest and with the support of my friends and family, I got clean.  It still wasn't easy, but holy shit was it easier than keeping all those secrets.  I could actually open up and talk about all these feelings that were creeping back.  I joined one of the fellowships. Holy shit there are other people out there who are just like me?  And they made it out the other side?  I couldn't believe it. I wasn't unique and I wasn't alone.  

6 years later and my life is back. My wife and I made it out the other side, we have a better relationship now then we ever had.  My kids are growing up, almost done with High School.  I can be there for them. Really be there without the fog and distraction of an opiate addiction.  My finances are back on track. I started over. I got a second chance.  I was able to hold my professional license and career because I was honest with the regulators about my addiction, it is a disease after all and I was getting treatment. I have a new better job now. 

That's pretty much my story.  If you made it this far your a champ.  I know I'm not some eloquent writer. I just want to say if you're out there struggling like I was then TELL ON YOURSELF.  There are people out there who who will love and support you.  Society loves a comeback story and is very forgiving for the addict who is trying their hardest to come back. 

DO NOT DO THIS ALONE. Find support, talk to people, be open and honest about your feelings. If you want it then fucking get it.  Do it like your life depends on it, because it does. You are worth it. Legends are born in the valley of struggle. Become a legend.

I don’t call myself healed. I call myself still here. That’s the only badge I wear.
If you’re tapering, if you’re cold turkey, if you’re on day 1 or day 1,000 your survival is the proof. You don’t have to be perfect, just present. You don’t have to glow, just breathe.
And if you feel like you’re alone, you’re not. Some of us built rooms out of our scars, places where you can bleed words instead of relapse. We call it UndergroundGods, but really it’s just people who get it.

136,1lrs0ph,Kratom helps with withdrawals… Psilocybin helps with staying clean why is no one mentioning this ?,Decent-Fun190,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1lrs0ph/kratom_helps_with_withdrawals_psilocybin_helps/,"Alright, I’ve been sharing a lot about kratom as a tool to get off opioids. Some people react positively, others are strongly against it and I get both sides. What I’ve noticed though, is that many people basically just swap their opioid of choice for kratom and assume that’s enough.

In my opinion, if you use kratom to get through opioid withdrawal, you should also plan to taper off it as soon as possible.

From my own experience, that’s when the real mental battle begins — the cravings, depression, endless thought loops… Psilocybin (mushrooms) helped me break those patterns and gave me a true mental reset.

And yet, hardly anyone talks about psilocybin in the context of addiction recovery. People struggle for years with methadone, Suboxone, even kratom — I see it all over Reddit — but rarely do I see people mentioning psilocybin as part of their recovery process. It’s not a magic pill, but honestly, it’s the closest thing to magic I’ve ever experienced.

To be clear: psilocybin won’t stop your physical withdrawals — but once you get through that phase, it can make a huge difference mentally. It’s non-addictive, not harmful to the body, yet rarely discussed when it comes to life after opioids.

For those interested: scientific research on psilocybin is already showing promising results in treating alcohol addiction, tobacco dependence, and even cocaine/crack use. The potential for mental health and addiction recovery is massive, but it’s still flying under the radar in most opioid recovery discussions.

Just thought I’d share that, hopefully it helps someone.",75

I’m petrified of being on subs long term. I’m very scared of experiencing acute withdrawals for a month. 

My goal is to only use the subs for about a week, using less and less each time to hopefully give myself a relatively soft landing into sobriety. Has anybody found success in this method?

It’s been years since I have engaged with any online communities dedicated to opioid use. Back when I started using, 2012-ish, I was very into tumblr and I used to browse Jinxie’s Natural Habitat and I was very active on Reddit. I just remembered that blog, and it made me think to check up on the Reddit communities and see what’s going on. All these years later, it’s weird to think about and hard to even imagine that was me. 

Anyway, I’ve been completely clean from heroin/fentanyl for 5 years in November. My life is pretty normal now.  I remember my days of posting on Reddit looking for help with withdrawal, trying to manage the balancing act that is life with a heroin addiction. Eventually the heroin wasn’t heroin anymore and the game completely changed. Sometimes I credit my recovery to that fact alone, because fentanyl was nothing like the stuff I first started using. 

I just want to let you know that if you’re going through it right now, in any capacity, you’re going to be okay. Withdrawal sucks, but it’s nothing compared to a life of dependency.

Tldr: methadone is actually pretty great, if you're truly ready to fight your way off opiates. Happy to answer any and all questions. Heck, I'll give my opinion on your situation and a recommended road map if you want. 

I'm prescribed 300mg gabapentin for restless legs and it's been very helpful for this whole process. 

A bit of history. I'd say I spent 7 years on and off hooked on fentanyl. Started around 2017. I was sober most of 2020 with the exception of a pill I had mailed to me (stupid). Had a few months sober here and there. 

35m and I'm a bit of a mixed bag. Sharp, educated, but from a redneck alcoholic family. Dad owned a bar, so had money and nice stuff, but everyone I knew was always drunk. 4.0 in high school, but grew mushrooms at 17. Yada yada yada.

First opiates were codeine and morphine pills a friend stole from neighbors he was house sitting for. Apparently their medicine cabinets were loaded with expired pill bottles like you wouldn't believe. There were 6 of us - 3 guys and 3 girls - and 2 big zip locks full of misc stolen pills. Tramadol, codeine, morphine, seroquel, ritalin, ativan, and I don't remember what else. I do (kinda) remember 2 weeks straight of skittle parties every day after school. 

Then I didn't touch opiates for nearly a decade. Hurt my back at 25, got morphine from a neighbor, jumped to blues a couple years later, and you all know how that goes. 

Ended up ruining a 4 year relationship, lost the woman I intended to marry, spiraled for a bit. Fought it, fell back, fought it, yada yada, almost killed myself more than once. The war stories I could tell. 

So how'd I get off...? 

----------------------------------------

----------------------------------------hammer time

Was at 4-5 blues a day at my worst, mix of smoked for the rush and snorted for longevity. More often though I was doing 2-3 a day. March last year I tried to taper myself off fent, took a week off work, got down to a quarter pill a day but couldn't get off, was back to 1-2 a day by start of April. 

By May I became desperate. I had never wanted off this badly. It was like something shifted mentally. I was willing to do anything. I literally thought about just stabbing my dealer. I cut my debit card in half to make it harder to get cash. Didn't really help. 

I had always avoided methadone because of horror stories from a friend who was on it 3 years and struggled to get off, then just relapsed. I was desperate though. 

Started methadone mid May 2024. First tapered off Xanax I'd been casually abusing, then last fent dose was June 2nd. 

I was scared, and had LOTS of experience trying to taper myself off fent (once successfully in 2021), so convinced the doctor (nurse wasn't having it, tried to fight me) to let me start tapering methadone immediately. 

Started at 65mg methadone, dropped 5mg per week a few weeks, then 3mg per week starting around 35mg. I took several breaks where I was stressed or just needed time for my body to adjust. Stayed at 12mg from mid October through the new year because the holidays led to several relapses in the past. 

How'd it feel? Not fun, but not terrible. I didn't have to take time off work, though I was a dick to my boss more than a couple times. Slept decent most nights. Physical withdrawals weren't that bad, but emotionally I was a wreck. 

Mood swings. Nothing was fun. It was basically 11 months of rarely having a good time and hating life, but having dealt with chronic depression and anxiety all my life, it was nothing I hadn't felt before. Just stubbornly persistent. 

I basically withdrew from the world. I have 800 hours on Cyberpunk 2077, I've read about 20k pages (mostly wheel of time), and I've watched Lord of the Rings extended edition I don't know how many times over the last year. 

Got down to 2mg. Took my last dose 2 weeks ago today. First few days I slept like shit, but otherwise felt surprisingly OK. Like tired, moody, occasional hot flashes, but better than expected. 

Today I feel mostly great. Sleep is meh, but could be worse. I'm on top of laundry, mowed my lawn and worked on my garden today, in a pretty good mood. I wish I had done this all sooner. Life is beautiful. ",12

But I like to celebrate the fentanyl recovery. It’s a big deal to me. Fentanyl consumed my every thought action and emotion for over 3 years. I was a complete slave to it and just constantly obsessed with using it and getting more. Even for the first year after I quit my cravings haunted me like a goddamn monster and my body still hurt and I was so tired and miserable. I relapsed a lot. The pain is so hard to deal with. 


But I wanna say this to anyone who needs to hear it. I haven’t touched fentanyl in over five years. I go months at a time now without even thinking of it. I very rarely feel even a mild craving for it or any opiate. In the last year I’ve consistently reported feeling absolutely zero physical pain to my doctor at my monthly check ups. 

I used fentanyl all day every day for 3 years and I felt so fucking hopeless. It ruled my life. My brain. My soul. I was so certain and so scared that even if I managed to stay clean, the overwhelming obsession and desire would never leave me alone. 


I go months now without even thinking about it. And I know you can too. 

You have to hang in there. I know it’s painful. And you’re fucking brave for going through it. 

Stay safe. ",5

I tried Suboxone clinics and never made it past 3 days for a year. 
I was struggling with chronic pain and it made staying sober so very hard. 
I would find a clinic, relapse, find a new clinic, relapse again. Rinse and repeat. 
After a year of doing this I finally found a clinic that I liked. I liked the Dr and the counselor and something stuck with me. I made it past 3 days and I finally took it seriously. 
I've been clean for two years now. 

I remember the days where the only thing on my mind was making money to get my pills. I withdrew from anyone who cared about me and spent most of my time alone. 

Life is good now. I've found hobbies I enjoy, I'm happy, and I am at a point where I don't have cravings anymore. 

I know the struggle it is to get off the stuff. But it is possible and I'm proud of every single one of you who are trying and taking it a day at a time. ",11

151,1odpqce,Alcohol destroyed my Childhood. Opiates destroyed my adulthood.,Historical-Love-4097,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1odpqce/alcohol_destroyed_my_childhood_opiates_destroyed/,"Something that clicked this time around getting clean was why I got high in the first place.

My brother and I grew up in a single mother home, she divorced my father when I was about 9 and he was about 13. We had lived in an apartment that was supposed to be temporary until the whole family moved to a house in CT. We would look as a family and then one day our mother woke us up to go say bye to our father. It was sometime in the Fall.

After that, shit went downhill fast. My brother started sneaking off to smoke weed with his freinds, drink even tried coke around that age and pretty much whatever else he could.

 We were told out father was a ""functioning alcoholic"" and he was for sure, but he was a pretty easygoing drunk. He didnt hit us, he didnt verbally abuse us, pretty much the opposite tbh. He was excitable and fun to be around. Sometimes it sucked cause after the divorce he was pretty depressed and seeing my father cry, at my age, as a boy learning to be a man, it was kinda crazy to see. Im not judging, but here I am a kid, and I feel like I gotta lift this guy up thats supposed to be doing that for me. Still though, in comparison to what it was like living with our mother, it was kind of a blessing. 

Our mother was, according to herself, a ""weekend warrior"" she'd go out everyday from Thursday to Saturday and get hammered. Thing is though, she was also a bartender Monday Through Thursday. She grew up in alcoholic home herself and all 3 of her brother died from drinking. 

No one could put fear into me like her. The only time ive ever experienced that type of fear is when I was in jail for 2 months and for 2 weeks I had a gang member trying to reform in my cell. The worst wasnt even getting the belt or beat, even though that sucked since I basically just had to sit there and take it knowing I could easily do something about it. The worst was the shit she would say and threaten. 

She'd tell us stuff like us being alive ruined her life, she didn't want us, our father tricked her into believing he was impotent. She even threatened to kill us or kill herself several times. Me and brother would just be hanging out and if she came out of the room past 10AM in the robe we knew to go into the basement and chill or leave the house, but even then she'd yell shit, or talk shit about us loud enough for us to hear. She'd throw fits randomly then go to her room and cry asking why? Over and over, and it made me feel pity for her even though it was literally about her not wanting us lol. ""Your father doesnt want you either"" 

It was pretty insane, at that same time I was expected to to well, I excelled academically and my brother not so much. We were pitted against each other constantly by her and him being bigger then me, I end up with alot of stiches. She didnt come home until around 6 or 7 and sometimes not at all. When my brother went to my dad's to live for a while, I was all alone with this insanity. Thats when it really got confusing because i had no one around to confirm how crazy she was being, so alot of the time, no matter how right I knew I was, id end up blaming myself anyway. 

She would say crazy shit, then just go blank trying to bait you, then just look at you and be like ""what?! Get a life, stop acting like a little girl"" or some wild shit like this. 

This whole period of my life and my brothers definitely fucked us up pretty significantly. I cant speak for him, but for me, now that im sober from opiates I realize so much of why I did them in the first place.

Its because no matter where I go in the world, I have this hypervigalence about everything. It kinda lied beneath the surface of however im really feeling. I overthink what im gonna say, and wonder if I even said enough, or could have worded things better. I overanyalze body language and eye contact. I want love but get afraid ill fuck it up and have trouble with silence even if its completely natural. Even when im feeling confident or self assured I constantly question it or try to reaffirm if its geniune or wonder if im being arrogant. 

This shit always surfaces when im sober, and truthfully its probably always there, but when I was on opiates I felt safer. I wasnt obviously, I was literally putting myself in more danger, but I know now why I did it and how I justified it.

It really got bad once I was homeless, it was bad when my father died and 2 months later my mother kicked me out of the house after a fight with her BF at the time and she told me ""i told you if you made me choose between him and you it would be him"" and keep in mind i was sober when this happened. She would let this guy push me around and punch me and told me if I hit him back she'd call the cops and say I hit him first.

It was truly insane, I felt trapped in a situation that just kept getting worse and my father dying made it even crazier becsuse I had no one who truly understand the situation and could get me to see reason. I think subconsciously or maybe even consciously I chose to do opiates to not onlt numb myself while being functional job wise during this insane stress, but also to live up to what was being projected onto me. If im such a burden I might as well make it worth it, and if you need someone to blame, fuck it ill be the scapegoat. At least then I can justify the amount of shit get shoveled down my throat. ""Yea she's hard on me, but i deserve it"" 

I never really got addicted to alcohol and it caused more destruction in my life then any other drug ive done. There's people in NA meeting who will roll their eyes when you bring up this kind of stuff, in my experience its usually old timers, and my best guess would be that it hits home for them. They've probably heard it from their kids and cant stand that its true. I get it, but thats doesnt make it less valid. And personally, in order for me to move past it, I have to admit it and accept it. Really understand where all this pain started. 

And trust me I get it, like I said, my mother grew up in an alcoholic home, as did my father. My father's parents werent abusive though, just slightly neglectful. My mother didnt have that same situation. They could easily say the same thing though, but it wouldnt be false. I used to think ""well we could just go back generationally and blame every generation so whats the point"" but im not looking to subvert blame, just to understand, for me, so i can heal from it and move on. I cant just pretend its all normal and all good. That shit shaped who I am today in the worst way. 

I hope anyone else battling addictions can find the strength to understand the root of their compulsions for control too. Because ultimately thats all addiction is. An urge to control emotions, attached to memories, situations or people that cant be changed, only understood and made peace with. Id argue though that most of us had no idea how to process and handle those emotions or even thought it was possible to when our addictive behaviors began. 

I know when I got serious this time, I told myself, im ready to feel all the pain, no more hiding from it. Let it all flow and in time it will get easier, and so far thats whats been happening. Snapshots of moments I suppressed all my life, probably in an effort to create a memory where that pain was somehow in my control or didnt exist at all. But the thing about life is, all of your life is yours. The good and the bad, doesnt make it your fault or and doesnt mean you need to depend on anyone for the good, it just means you gotta accept it for what it is, cuz like my dad used to say religiously: ""I know you hate to hear this buddy, but It Is What It Is""

I got to work that day without doing any heroin for 8 hours already, feeling like absolute shit. Yawing, sweating, anxiety, and nausea started to set in quick. Did I mention this is my stepdads, dad’s business. So it’s not like I can just go home cause I lived with him and my mom at the time. They both worked there too. I was like 19 at the time. 

    It was a Friday and that was payday so I figured I could bullshit half the day till my hour lunch break, take a drive downtown to my guy and come back. WRONG! We had a $40,000 delivery job to take that required the box truck and not just a pickup truck like normal. Guess who was the only one of the 3 of us who could drive it, ME! :) Also had to load up all the windows and 1x4, 1x6, and 1x12, probably like 20 single windows, 8 doubles, and 2 triples. 

   When I tell you that was the longest drive of my life (1 hour), I almost went off the road just from being so inside my head. Thankfully the 2 guys with me were about my age and they already knew what was up. They didn’t really care, they did let me just hand off all the stuff and they take it into the garage of the customers house. We chilled in the A/C for a hour and by then it was time to go back. Since we didn’t take a lunch, we could sometimes leave work a hour early. So soon as I got back, I gave them the keys and paperwork to turn in and I left at 3:00(closes at 4). Went and got some and got sold some bullshit so had to wait another 2 days till my other guy had some. 😩

   Big boss man wasn’t happy, ended up getting fired and it really sucked. My mom came home pissed and looking back, I don’t blame her. I ended up progressing to fentanyl after for a little while until I OD’d for the first time and then a second time all in 1 week. This was right when Covid hit and heroin was mixed or non existent. So I ended up saying “I want dogfood(H)” knowing it was all fent, just didn’t care at the time and was depressed. 

 16 months sober and never felt better 👍🏻 Never really crave it anymore cause how much destruction it did to my life and health.

I was so ashamed and worried about the stigma I would face inside the ER, but I was immediately given 16mg of Suboxone which unfortunately put me into precip (it was about 30 hours after last use) after that they admitted me and have been giving me 40mg oxy every 3 hours for the symptoms, Deludid IV as needed, methadone that goes up 20mg a day until I feel comfortable and of course aderax and colonine. I'm still extremely uncomfortable and still feel extremely severe withdrawal, which the oxy and Deludid are not really helping but I'm so so relieved they are trying to keep me comfortable here and being so nice.

This is in San Francisco so I'm just glad I can be in a safe place where I can get sober and not use.

I've been addicted for 5 years at this point, and most of the years I used all my savings, until 2 years ago, where I slowly had spent so much of my income that I had to take on loans (BAD loans with a high %) in order to keep working and not get sick.

Fast forward to this day, several of my loans have now gone to the phase where they will take assets from me, I am deeply indebted (which is like 100.000 USD I think, half of which with 20% a year, the other half 5%) and struggle to think positively about this as I am trying to get clean. When I am clean, the burden of this seems so overhwelming that I end up dosing to get away from it, which of course is stupid.

  
But anyway.. I just wanted to hear from other people who maybe found themselves in the same situation as me, how they tackled it or are planning to tackle it.. succes stories too are of course very welcomed..

I’m a 23 y/o female, I’m a wife and a successful small, online business owner. I started oxy and hydro about 8 months ago, when I was working a little part time job and a coworker offered me a perc as I struggle really bad with back pain after a procedure I had done when I was younger. I then started buying them from someone, started doing them only to “feel good” kind of how some people drink alcohol (I don’t drink) then I started using heavier on the daily basis. Not to “feel good” but just to function and not be in WD. My husband also worked out of town and was gone like 5/6 days a week, so I was able to hide my addiction well especially since I have my own income I bought them with. I live in a different state than I was born in, and I don’t have anything to do with my own family as they’re toxic, and I hid my addiction from my in laws. I don’t have many friends, so no one knew or suspected a thing from me as I’ve never struggled with addiction in the past, besides nicotine and caffeine. In the last month, I picked up “blues” which I’m 99% are fent pills. I haven’t tested them, but I just know they’re fent. They’re the same price as regular oxys in my area, and they were a much better “bang for my buck” especially when I got a hot batch (dangerous, I know) but after doing them, oxy or hydro wouldn’t even fase me or get me out of WD. Only blues, so that became my DOC that I used HEAVILY. Well, a few weeks ago my husband came back home as he had an amazing job opportunity in our town, and him being back made it pretty hard to go meet my 🔌 , especially since my 🔌 was absolutely awful to get in touch with and often made me wait HOURS, which always put me in WD especially if I had ran out already. This led to me being “sick” every damn day. I’d wake up multiple times throughout the night withdrawaling, and had to lay in bed some days because I couldn’t move until I got my fix. My husband is ex law enforcement and also a recovered addict who has been sober for 7 years (very proud of him). I am a person who has a few health issues anyway, so he just thought it was my issues causing me to me so sick, although once I came clean about everything, he did say that he suspected it a tiny bit, but did not want to think that because he’s never had a reason to.

I tried to quit cold turkey a few times over the last few weeks, and I ended up in absolute hell, and lapsed every time. Okay, fast forward to Monday evening, 08/9/2025 I attempted to cold turkey yet again, but I was somewhat more hopeful than I had been for the last few attempts. I was in a bad mental state, but so ready to get out because this addiction has taken so much from me that I wanted to grow some lady balls and get through it. My husband cold turkey’d meth, pills, and other things and I remembered his story, so I thought I could do the same…

TW: blood, self harm, pregnancy loss, withdrawal 

I constantly vomited up bile for 18/20 hours, until it turned to just blood. In my withdrawals, vomiting, cold sweating, leg pain/RLS, anxiety, ect were my normal symptoms, but this time it was 100 times worse and I had different symptoms including the mental and full body convulsions, my eyes would roll into the back of my head and I’d hyperventilate. I take buspar for anxiety, have been on it for years, but I wasn’t able to keep anything down so I threw up my medicine although he gave it to me multiple times so I could get it in me. I suspect I was WD’ing from that as well. Then, as time went on I started having more intense psychological, symptoms that I’ve never experienced before. I am a person that struggles with anxiety and depression, but this was some serious dark hell that I went through and I’m wanting to know has anyone else ever experienced this. I only know this because he told me and he took some videos for me to see when I came to. I started to harm myself, I pulled out so much of my hair, banged my head against hard surfaces to try and bust my head open, I attacked my husband when he was giving me a bath and I scratched/bit/fought, I screamed for so many hours until I lost my voice, and at some point on Tuesday, I asked him to take me to the ER. He had wanted to take me all along, but I refused out of shame for what was really happening. I only remember bits and pieces up until this point then it went even blacker. I remember getting to the ER, the nurses getting me into a room and me begging them for help and getting my meds in my IV (I’m deathly afraid of needles so the IV absolutely disgusted me, especially since my veins were in such bad condition from dehydration). They gave me adavan, saline drips and some zofran. A lady from the detox program came in and spoke with me, and once I got more stable I talked to her more. I had an option of 5 days in detox, with no communication or visitors (I completely understand why) but my business is very important to me, I sell and grow rare, exotic houseplants that require very strict care. I don’t have anyone that could do it for me, if I would’ve been able to FaceTime my husband and tell him how to do it when they needed it then I would’ve, but that was against the rules. So I knew I’d possibly be facing thousands of dollars in losses, as crazy as it may seem.. so I opted for a different route and if I couldn’t do it on my own, then I’d go to detox and have my stuff in order before I left. The other option I had was the ER doctor give me some more adavan and send me in a 3 day supply of suboxon the following morning since the ER didn’t have any on the floor, so I’d have to wait. So I did. my husband said as the night went on, I begged the nurses to k!ll me, and eventually I started hallucinating and I thought our dogs and reptiles were in the hospital room. He said I talked to them for about 30 minutes then I dozed off. He said I kept waking up and doing that, then something worse even happened. I started “my period” when I in the hospital, since I bled and threw up all over my clothes, they put me a gown on until he was able to leave and go get me clean clothes from home. The doctor noticed some very large blood clots and asked about my period. My period has been very irregular lately, and I had no pregnancy symptoms at all. Once the doctor noticed that, he started checking me out *per my husband, I do not remember any of this*. I had an adult diaper on at this point, and in my diaper was a 9/10 week fetus I passed  and some of the tissue. I literally miscarried when I was going through hell, had no idea, and I do not remember seeing it or hearing about that.

Then, they discharged me, my husband brought me home and he said I was still in a schizophrenic rage even after the adavan, and when he got me home he helped me get a bath, try and water and my buspar in me and put a period pad on. He said when he started to tell me what had happened, I broke down screaming, crying, and threw my diaper/pad I had on against our white bathroom wall. And I did, because when I woke up the next morning, it looked like someone was murdered in our bathroom. I’ve never done anything like that in my life and I do not remember any of it. 

Fast forward to Thursday, I had to travel two hours to a clinic that proscribed me suboxon. I did not want to start subs, but I feel as if they’re my best chance to get sober as I’ve done my research and I will be tapering off. I have to go to my clinic every week, and I start with a local addiction and mental health counselor next week, because I have some deep, dark demons that have to be addressed especially after losing our baby. I have to find a way to cope with my sadness, differently than I have been. 

As of right now, I don’t feel great. My energy is low, I’m not sleeping well, but my mind is clearer than it has been being. Since I’ve lost so much blood and got so dehydrated, I’ve been eating plenty of nutritious foods, plenty of electrolytes and water and trying to spend more time doing the things I use to enjoy. 


I hid my addiction for so long because I was too ashamed to ask for help from my husband or in-laws or be honest with my husband about it, from pure shame. My parents would be so mean to me anytime I came to them with any issue, so I kind of carried that trauma with me. Not saying lying and hiding things is ok! I take full responsibility for that. I’ve taken accountability for it all, I’ve apologized to everyone I’ve hurt, especially my husband. And I’m so incredibly grateful that he has been so helpful to me. He helped me bathe when I couldn’t stand, he never hurt me when I was raging out, he makes sure I take my subs the way as directed by my doctor, ect. I’m extremely blessed, and I guess I truly had to hit ROCK BOTTOM to finally get the help I needed and I’m so ready to be fully sober in the future. That experience traumatized me so badly, that I truly don’t even want to think about using again.

If anyone reads my full post, thank you. Thank you for listening to me, and if you’re struggling right now, please don’t hesitate to get help. You deserve to get out💚",19

I think my best option moving forward is just to get on Suboxone and stabilize and then do a very slow taper. I don’t think I can deal with crippling anxiety on top of everything else and expect to move forward and recover this way in the next few weeks. As soon as I start to feel a little hungry again the anxiety comes on even stronger. 

I had an anxiety disorder for four years after going through benzo withdrawal. I just don’t want to drag my body through that again even if it’s only for a fraction of the time. I just don’t think I have the strength to do it again.

Yeah, you're not like everyone else are you? I mean how could you be, you're a chronic migraine sufferer, the most normal thing to do is to seek relief.
But that's not it, is it? Because the pain relief was never enough. You need the nod. You want to completely melt into your bed, to be in the state of existence without feeling or fearing. And it's fun, it always is the first few days. Then your tolerance goes up, because of course it does. And it's fine, you'll just do 30mg today. No biggie.
Suddenly you're doing 120mg a day, throwing up half the stuff you eat and unable to stop. And I did stop. Thats the dumbest part. I had recovered and almost forgotten that somewhere in this house is the rest of my grandma's stash. Until I confessed to my mom, and she let the location slip. For 2 months I've been back on them and man, I don't even like the feeling 90% of the time. But I couldn't drink, it's so boring and also lead to me being sick.

I visited my mom Sunday, I have done days without Oxys, it'll be fine. Worst case scenario I would pop two or three and move on. That's not what happened. 
You see, in my naivety I was convinced I am too smart to go through withdrawals that are this bad. It started with one big throw up, Sunday night. Then the sweating began. I vomited bile for a whole day, went to the ER to get an IV for nausea and hydration. I was cramping up and slurring my words. The vomiting continued last night, a night I spent in sleepless agony, throwing up until my lips were bloody and my esophagus felt like a rock. I went to my doctor today, made up some bullshit about chinese food I had Sunday and how it's probably food poisoning. It's probably not. I'm just too embarrassed to admit that I went back on Oxys after all this time.

You NEVER wanna feel like this again. Two IV's and I'm still fighting to keep down sips of watered down gatorade. Oxy's don't make you happy, they make you sleepy. They numb the pain and depression, but so does weed, and that would never do you like this. Just stick to smoking, you stupid bitch. 

I'm not sure if taking Oxy now would help at all with the process, I'm tempted, but ultimately just enjoying not puking every 20 minutes. My head is splitting in half and my stomach feels like a warzone. But I think the worst is behind me now, at least I hope so.

I feel like such an idiot, I was done with Oxys, I never even really liked them. And yet....",14

I’m at ten months clean from fent/heroin and go to NA meetings a lot, and the narrative pushed is that a 12 step program is the only way to recover and total abstinence is the only option.

Attenuation of opioid withdrawal with high dose ascorbic acid

What's up guys? Long time no see! I have stumbled upon some information that is so profound that I had to come back and visit you guys and share it with you. Please don't be afraid to give this a try and leave a comment about your results and also share with others you know who may benefit from it.

When you know that you are about to run out of your opioid of choice you need to start mega-dosing ascorbic acid (vitamin c). The studies I am going to link at the end suggest taking 300mg/kg, but we have better forms of this compound available now and I have gotten the dose down to approximately 155mg/kg by taking liposomal vitamin c instead of just the regular ascorbic acid vitamin c. This works because liposomal vitamin c's oral bioavailability is 1.77 times greater than regular oral vitamin c.

I am not joking one bit when I tell you that **taking the dose I recommended above will relieve 80-90% of the withdrawal symptoms from a serious fucking fentanyl habit.** If you don't know what I mean by the mg/kg part I will break it down: if you weigh 170 pounds you need to convert that to kilograms (kg) by dividing by 2.2, which gives us ~77.3kg. You then multiply the dose of the liposomal vitamin c (155mg) by your body weight in kg (~77.3) giving you about 12,000mg. Yes, I know, 12,000mg sounds crazy, but it's not really considering one tablet of what I am going to link contains 1650mg. 

You can buy 297,000mg (29g) of liposomal vitamin c from Walmart for $21, which works out to less than $1 a day to feel significantly better. This method is absolutely fucking amazing to use if you are actually trying to detox because vitamin c does not prolong the suffering because it is not an opioid, it just masks a very large chunk of the shitty ass withdrawal symptoms.

I will also add that I did take therapeutic doses of loperamide when I used this method to come off my fent habit. I was able to eat, sleep, and even go to work (pretty much fucked off because this still isn't a magic bullet) all because of the liposomal vitamin c.

Alright, enough from me. Here are some sources:

**Here are some peer reviewed studies on this topic and a brief TL;DR**

*1. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10836211

TLDR: Heroin addicts as patients Control group treated with conventional meds (no vit C) experienced major withdrawal in 56.6% of patients. Vitamin C group experienced major withdrawal in 10-16.6% some bias in this study however if you read into it

*2. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7572147/

TLDR: High, frequent doses of AA may also abort cravings and opioid withdrawal symptoms in those with OUD and has better tolerability than other OUD treatments.

*3. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2852062/

TLDR: Rats addicted to morphine and then put into precipitated WD with naloxone showed far less 'escape jumps and tail flicks' (sort of like RLS) when they were treated with high dose Ascorbic Acid

*4. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6686637

TLDR: In mice: vit C, when co-administered with morphine, suppresses the development of tolerance and physical dependence on the drug

*5. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5107231/

TLDR: 97 patients, half given high dose 50 mg/kg vitamin C, the other half placebo. Both groups given morphine before operation. 2 hours after surgery the VitC group self administered significantly lower morphine consumption and reported LOWER pain after 24 hours than the placebo group (only morphine group)

*6. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4183085/

TLDR: Complex study on mice basically proving VitC had a profound effect when combined with Tramadol or Morphine

*7. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25250292

TLDR: Rats had operation to fix a cannula to their vein, then subjected to 12 days of self-administration of morphine for 12 days, if rats received high dose of VitC before self-admin, they used less morphine, also, rats injected with higher doses of VitC showed significantly less symptoms after naloxone induced precipitated WD. (check out the images at the bottom of the study, very interesting)

*8. http://whale.to/v/c/stone.html

TLDR: Pilot study called *The Hypoascorbemia-Kwashiorkor Approach to Drug Addiction Therapy.* Gives more information and case studies using high dose sodium ascorbate with other vitamins and minerals.


Hopefully this will help a few people, I sure as fuck know it helped me!

I wasn't supposed to live long and was in tremendous pain so dependency and addiction wasn't an issue but I ended fighting cancer for around 11 years. Been found to have no evidence of disease. They don't like to say remission. 
Cancer took everything from me. Feels almost like having all those years taken from me. I was newly married and owned a very successful restaurant with my wife. She was by my side for 13 years before we got married. We had so many adventures, truly living a life I could only dream of. 
Then at 36 I was diagnosed with stage 4 melanoma. It was my wife that made the appointment. I had zero symptoms and now  facing death within months. She stayed with me at the beginning, surgeries and chemo, and then something changed. She moved out while I was in the hospital and served me with divorce papers. I was dieing and she left me. You want to talk about destroyed. The mountain I was facing, I was now doing alone. She abandoned me at the worst part of my life. I don't know how you can do that to someone. 
The surgeries and chemo were brutal, cancer was spreading rapidly to my stomach, intestines, lungs and liver. 
I was in the hospital allot and the restaurant closed down. She abandoned that too.  
Anyway.i honestly don't know if it was a subconscious defense mechanism or what it was. She was remarried and pregnant and I was alone.I lost everything but somehow the weeks turned into years. I've been fighting this for 11 years, lots of MRI, CT and PET scans and years of chemo and immunotherapy and I made through that hell just to be faced with this mother fucker of an opponent.
 I've taken thousands of pain pills being prescribed around 500 pills per month. 10 mg oxy, 8 mg Dilaudid, 30 mg morphine and fentanyl patches for 11 years now. I needed every one of those too. The pain was undescribable. Hundreds of staples and stitches, so many surgeries.
So here I am on my second day and this is up there with the level of discomfort I'm in right now and I've done some painful things. 
I'm done with it but damn I'm alone and would love to communicate with someone with some encouragement or something. Life has beaten me down so much. I don't trust easily. Been years and I still miss her. Don't know if I'll ever get over it. 
Anyway I know I'm all over the place but I'm hurtin. I refuse to believe that I don't have more to do. More to accomplish and maybe even find love again. I guess I'm starting to get the emotional part of withdrawal. Just started so who knows. ",85
180,1jay789,Beating opioids/long post,[deleted],23,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1jay789/beating_opioidslong_post/,"Hi guys

I just thought I would give my story with my battle with opioids  to see if I can help any people.

I started using heroin at the age of 17, to be honest I know it sounds weird but I didn’t even know what it was. I’m from the UK and was heavily into the 90s rave scene, using Molly, speed, ket but only on the weekends  when I was going to allnight rave parties. I would smoke  weed every night though. 

One particular night  I saw one of my friends smoking something off some foil but wasn’t sure what it was and they just said it was something to help them sleep from the come down and called it Brown, bear in mind no Internet then no social media . I decided to try some and thought the taste was disgusting but it immediately brought me down and it helped me sleep

This would continue for some time, just doing it on the weekends still unaware. 

Then I noticed I would do it on a Tuesday and then on a Thursday, put a long story short before I knew it I was almost doing it every day and then one day I woke up And I felt really anxious stomach cramps sweating and almost felt like I was speeding, eyes like golf balls. 

I was at work when this happened and my older friend I told him and he asked me if I’d been using heroin I said I’ve been using something called Brown. He said take this and if you feel better you need to get help,obviously that was methadone. 20 minutes later I felt immediately normal and knew it’s gotten its rotten claws into me. 

From then 17  till 24 it was a downward spiral I lost everything pretty much but luckily my mum and dad still supported me although they did kick me out at one stage. 

I was doing H , crack, benzos sometimes together and surprised I’m not dead. I was also using iv :(

4  failed rehab attempts, then my mother researched a place called detox five where basically they knock you out for five days so supposedly you get over the easiest part of the withdrawal. 

So I went there and did the protocol, like an idiot I never told them I had a benzo tolerance so I actually woke up on day two and I had to give me double the dose. 

I woke up on day five feeling obviously very tired and relaxed from the benzos thinking yeah that’s it. I did not  know  Mr withdrawal was doing push-ups in the corner waiting to smack the crap out of me as soon as I got home and boy it did. 

I literally had zero sleep for around three weeks, rls for a long time and crazily dilated pupils for a long time and  severe anxiety with no appetite or energy.   

I had no friends because they were all users and I literally felt at the age of 24 my life was over and I’ve lost my best friend, there was no information about doing protocols like taking supplements to ease things/vit c protocol and increased dopamine levels it was fucking brutal. 

But as each week/month past I started sleeping that tiny little bit more and getting my energy back. It took  me around almost 9 months to feel somewhat normal regarding the physical symptoms

Then one day I watched a movie called American Psycho, that was the day where I got motivated to go and try and change myself not because he was a psychopath ha ha it was because of his workout routine and the way he looked after himself I know it’s only a movie but still

That day me and my counsellor went to the gym and I got kind of hooked ever since on that, got talking to different people and after around four months a guy got me to do a triathlon with him which I kind of fell in love with. 

One year after that I was competing in ironman triathlons, two years after that I qualified for the world championship. but I’m kind of an extreme person but basically that’s where I was getting my dopamine from and that’s what I got addicted to

My life would continue like this competing in different sports until 38 years of age until my father died and then literally one week after I found out my wife of 10 years had been cheating on me.

So I did not want to be in the same house as her and moved out to a new area with all my belongings. One particular day I really hurt my back in the gym and I had boxes and boxes of codeine p 30 mg. These are from the previous injury but I just kept on collecting them from the pharmacy but not even taking them just collecting them. 

I popped 3  that day and roughly 30 minutes later I was like oh God this feels so nice and it made all the pain I was going through at the time go away and you probably know what’s coming next I got addicted to codeine. 

Of course they  are a different beast to H, fent/oxy

So I will get addicted to codeine from 2016 until 2018. Then in 2019 I lost my brother to cancer and started using codeine again 

Then I quit the codeine again in mid 2020 and I’ve been clean from opioid since. 

Any opioids are a fucking evil drug and some Doctors it seems to me actually want to get you on them I don’t know whether they get commission or something

I’m not sure if my post will help anyone who is trying to quit but my point is if you are trying to quit be kind to yourself in your withdrawal phase and when you’re feeling better find something that you’re passionate about there’s got to be something you’re passionate about. 

Whether it’s working out, hiking , cooking, computers, video games or whatever else

My problem is also I have ADHD so I do get addicted to things quite easily but now I just have to make sure that they’re positive things i  get addicted to

I’m assuming many posts have been written like this on this sub.   I just thought I would share my story to see if it can help motivate anyone

181,1iyzir2,1 month clean,[deleted],24,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1iyzir2/1_month_clean/,"I have one month clean from all opiates/opioids today 😀 I have NEVER been able to accomplish this amount of clean time without MAT or incarceration. I've also realized something. Every other time I've ever gotten clean, I always knew in the back of my head that I was just resting up for a while. I never told myself ""We're never doing this again."" I'm actually scared this time, and making choices that I never have. I'm trying to be as proactive as I can. I've done this for about 15 years on and off and I think I'm finally tired enough to figure out a solution. I really feel like the street fent scared the shit out of me. This was also the first relapse where I stopped MYSELF. No family intervention. No incarceration. I woke up and I was disgusted with myself. Pretty much all of my physical symptoms have subsided. Now, I'm just grappling with the anxiety and very little sleep. In spite of that, I'm extremely grateful to be alive & clean today. I did some thinking earlier about what is different this time so that I could tell others. I came up with this: This is the first time that I decided to tell myself I'm strong enough to do this instead of telling myself I'm weak. Historically, my will power has ALWAYS been for shit. I guess my point is the shit that we say to ourselves matters A LOT more than the shit other people say to us sometimes. I've always had a good support system of people who love me and believe that I can do it. I never believed I could do it. I believe it now. I just want to say to the people still using or in acutes that you can do it. It feels like it will never pass, but it does. Things get better everyday. Please dont let that wicked voice in your head tell you that it's all for naught. You DESERVE to reclaim your life. ",13

I prayed and prayed for months for God to get me off this medicine because I knew I could never do this on my own. Weaning wasn’t an option because we know we have it so we take it the first sign of uncomfortableness. So this is what happened. The pharmacies I was getting my rx filled from no longer would fill them because the doctor got red flagged. Okay so I found a different place that had the exact one I took. Guess what happened next, the doctor was no longer able to fill narcotics for not just me but for anyone else. Now I don’t know how spiritual some of you are BUT I truly believe that God heard all my prayers and he crashed everything around me so I could no LONGER HAVE ACCESS to that medication. So I had no other choice but to withdrawal and do it cold turkey. I am 4 days in and I’m still struggling with the restless legs and arms and also the hot/cold sweats. On my 2nd day I went to the ER for help because I could no longer bear those electrical shocks throughout my body after nearly 48 hours. That hospital told me “all I can offer you is a bag of fluids” I wanted to jump off that bed and ring his throat. Instead I took the bag of floods and drove home. I fell asleep on the freeway and the only reason I didn’t crash out was from the rumble strips waking me up. I had laid in my living room floor the 2 days prior in agony so my body was exhausted to say the least. I’m grateful and I’m thankful for this deliverance. I’m almost 40 and I want to live a pure life. I know I had to go through this and feel every bit of this so that I would never ever go back. Anyone out there wondering if you are strong enough to do it, the answer is yes!!!! I’m a mom of 3 young kids and not a single soul knew of my oxy use. Each day we wake up we are a little better. You can do this, but only if you’re truly ready too. You have to face it one day. ",43
185,1ml6w8t,Wired shut,Cool_Grass1029,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1ml6w8t/wired_shut/,"Untitled - Anonymous Recovery Story

I was 17. Still on foot, no car. That was safer — easier to run, to disappear when needed. Supposed to re-up that day. Some so-called friends walked up, acting like they were gonna dap me up. Next thing I know, black.

I wake up on the ground, someone’s kicking me in the ribs, another’s digging in my pockets. I couldn’t feel much at first. I didn’t know my mouth was literally hanging open. They took my phone, my cash, whatever I had. I got to my side chick’s house somehow — told her to get me to the hospital.

First hospital didn’t care. No insurance? Not their problem. They said they couldn’t do the surgery there, wanted to send me by ambulance to another state. All I could think was, “That ambulance ride’s gonna cost more than I can hold.” I had a family member drive me instead — against medical orders. Doc handed me a bottle of pills and said, “This’ll get you through.”

I didn’t cry. I think I was still in shock. Maybe just used to pain by then.

Made it to the other hospital. Some doc took the case pro bono. They put me under and wired my jaw shut. Ribs broken, body full of weird fluid pockets. Couldn’t move without pain — especially this burning feeling down my neck and ears. I knew something was wrong.

They sent me home with 10mg hydros. After the surgery: liquid Percocet, 10mg per 5mL. Gave me a 5 oz bottle — I could refill it three times. But every time it wore off, the pain hit like a wildfire in my head. I read the discharge paperwork: “possible nerve damage.”

I went back. Brought the meds with me to prove I wasn’t drug seeking. I didn’t want the pills — I wanted the pain fixed. Instead, the doc walked in, hit me with a needle, and upped my dose.

That’s how it started.

Six months in, I realized I was thinking more about the pills than the pain. My jaw was healing. I could walk. I could breathe. But I didn’t want to stop. I needed them. Not just for pain anymore — for life.

And I had connections. I was already working and selling. I knew older cats who loved coke more than pills. So I’d grab an 8-ball for cheap, sell it off piece by piece, and stack pills as profit. Wholesale perks, retail coke. Simple math. Take a couple to keep myself moving. Morning, lunch, after work. Nighttime was the heavy part.

I started telling myself I was doing it for the money, for the hustle. But I was losing control.

My wife — she noticed things I didn’t. Shallow breathing. Slowed heart rate. I’d stop breathing in my sleep. She’d shake me awake, terrified.

I told her to relax. Told her if she liked the life — the house, the bags, the cars — then I needed to do me.

She looked me dead in the face and said, “I don’t want you to die in your sleep. I need you.”

I’ll never forget those words. Still brings tears. That moment was the clarity. Everything clicked.

I gave my phone to my boy, told him to hold it down, keep people from showing up looking for a fix. Took time off work. Locked myself in.

Day 1 wasn’t too bad… until hour 14. Shaking. Sweating. Couldn’t sleep. Couldn’t sit still. Seizure hit. People told me to go to the hospital. I said, “F**k them.” I wasn’t giving them the satisfaction. I knew if I stepped foot in there again, they’d slap a label on me: “addict.” And I’d never get taken seriously again.

Day 2 was worse. Piss, shit, sweat, vomit — all at once. Felt like my body was on fire. Couldn’t keep water down. Muscles locked up so bad I couldn’t even stretch without cramping. Couldn’t eat. Couldn’t walk.

Day 3, I was still in the shower, curled up, water turned cold. My body was rejecting life. My mind? It was on constant defense. Thinking. Planning. What if someone comes? What if I break?

Day 4, I managed a banana. An apple. Maybe some bread. Still wanted it, but I could stand. Could walk. Wasn’t convulsing.

Day 5, I had pride again. I didn’t win the war, but I survived the worst battle.

And even now — years later — I still twitch. Still get spasms in my sleep. Maybe it’s nerve damage. Maybe it’s just what happens after you put your body through hell.

But I’m here.

And I’m clean.

Not because I’m strong.
But because someone loved me enough to say, “I need you.”

And because I finally believed them.",2

To Anyone Out There Struggling With Opiates:

I see you. I know the war you’re fighting — not just against the drug, but against the guilt, the shame, the grief, and the lies your mind tells you when you’re at your lowest. I’ve been there. I know what it’s like to feel broken, like you’re too far gone, like the damage is too deep to ever come back from.

But here’s the truth — you can live again. You can build a life in recovery that is stronger, richer, and more meaningful than anything you ever imagined. And not only that — you deserve that life.

Recovery isn’t easy. It’s messy, painful, and raw at times. But it’s also beautiful. It's waking up without chains. It’s laughing again. It’s rebuilding trust. It’s finally looking in the mirror and seeing someone worth fighting for. I’m not just speaking as someone who hopes it’s possible — I’m speaking as someone who knows it is. I'm living proof.

If you're in the middle of the storm, if you're barely hanging on, please hear me: you’re not alone. You’re not weak for struggling. And you’re not beyond saving. Recovery is not about being perfect — it’s about being willing. Willing to try again. Willing to reach out. Willing to believe, even if it’s just a little bit at first.

If you ever need someone to talk to, someone who gets it without judgment — I’m here. Reach out. I don’t care if we’ve never met. I’ll listen. I’ll be that hand reaching back when you’re slipping.

We do recover. One day, one choice, one breath at a time.

With love and respect,
S....

Growing up, I floated through life, unsure of what I wanted. In my teens my social anxiety kinda stared to ruine my life, so trying to find a solution i started using stimulants and other drugs two years ago. At first, they were perfect .They gave me confidence, improved my depression, and even made me a bit ambitious. I wasn’t addicted to them at least it didnt feel like i was. 

Back then, my drug use wasn't that bad and manageable. I’d use substances occasionally, using them for productivity mostly. But over the months i tried more and more and it keept getting more regular. Until now where my use is often multiple substances daily.

Then I found nitazenes. Normal opioids weren’t pleasurable for me, I tried everything over time it wasn't no more about productivity more about escaping from who i am. I even tried to shooting up heroin but really only nitazenes did it for me. They erased everything. No anxiety, no loneliness, no thought about my future. I didn’t care that my life was stagnant or that I was destroying myself. For two months, I used them daily, chasing that void. I nearly overdosed and felt nothing no fear, no regret. I didn't really saw the problem in dying unexpectedly peacefully.

Three weeks ago, I quit opioids mainly becaue i ran out. But now I’m worse off than ever. My mind is hollowed out. Without stimulants, I’m paralyzed. I’ll lie in bed for hours, unable to do anything really. Simple tasks, feel impossible. I got into stimulants again just to survive, but they don’t work nearly as effective anymore, almost just to feel normal i have to take them. I can take meth and continue to lay in my bed without any motivation for anything. No joy, no motivation, just mechanical existence.  
I can't quit drugs, If I do if feel like I'm going to lose my job and fail school. But I also can't continue doing what I do otherwise my liver is going to fail on me with only 20 years old.

Opioids broke something in me. They made me numb to how broken I was, and now even though I’m off them, I still feel numb to my nosy of my problems. My liver’s still a concern, but that’s not what scares me. It’s the psychological problems, that I can’t get anything done, can’t feel anything well except anxiety, unless I’m high. 

I know I should give myself time to recover, but I really don't know how people are able to get off drugs for more than a year. I keep thinking about opioids even tho they fucked me up. And even if I never touch them I'm still stuck in a loop to fix the consequences from drug use with more drug use. Has had anyone similar experiences? I would be really thankful for useful comments!

Even among addicts I still get strongly opposed to this, even tho a two second Google search will confirm.

Is it still today a commonly believed thing?",43

201,1n1ef7m,1 Year Sober Today,LuckyMofo1111,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1n1ef7m/1_year_sober_today/,"Hey y’all. 

I am new to Reddit. Today I have been sober from fent (and all other substances) for exactly one year. I was a real hopeless case, physically couldn’t recognize myself, mentally broken, and emotionally unhinged. I hated myself and pitied myself but somehow also thought I was better and smarter than everyone else. I thought I was invincible because no matter how much I tried I just couldn’t seem to die. I did at least one terrible thing every day to get what I needed. Never in a million years thought I could get better. 

I am sharing this to let anybody stuck in it know that it is possible. It did not happen in one day but the self pity is gone, the shame and guilt is gone, I have a relationship with my family and friends and MYSELF that I didn’t think was achievable. The single most important thing I did was start listening to other people who have been through this and made it out the other side. I think back and I was always “willing to do anything” to get out of hell until someone suggested something even mildly uncomfortable or unfamiliar. This time I tried actually doing all the things people had been saying might help me for years. Wouldn’t you know, all that stuff helped. Detox sucked but it helped, rehab helped, therapy helped, meds helped, recovery programs helped. 

I used to make excuses for why I couldn’t afford to do that stuff or why it wouldn’t work for me. Frankly, the only real reason i had not to try ANYTHING was that I wasn’t ready to change. As soon as I admitted that I didn’t know what I was doing, I’m not smarter than everybody else, as soon as I started letting others help me, everything got much better very, very fast. I am even kind of grateful for everything I went through because it has given me an incredible appreciation for life. I know different people get sober differently but I can only share what worked for me. Please feel free to ask me anything or DM me if you are going through it. ",11

I thought I would share somethings I've noticed 2 years into this. 

He continues to work SO hard on himself. He's in therapy every other week. He stays in touch with others in recovery. Makes a point about hitting the gym as much as he can (sometimes that's 4 days a week and sometimes once a week.) 

The other day, he didn't get paid on time for a gig he did on the weekend. He was rightfully annoyed with the company (partly because he had to ask why he hadn't been paid yet instead of them notifying him of the issue.) But he also told me he felt a little emotionally triggered from it and it was linked to feelings from his addiction.  Basically, he was in such debt during his addiction, that being paid late would be catestrophic. But present day, it was fine. Annoying and unprofessional but we are okay. 

But recognizing that, I think is so huge. There are tons of little moments like that. They make me so proud of him. He's really putting in the work and it's inspiring, just as humans. ",7

Instead of asking you how long this will last… I’m asking what are the benefits of quitting? How did you see your life change positively? How did you feel once you got through it? Did you feel healthy again? Did your thoughts change? My hope and prayer is that once I get through the gnarly withdrawals that I’ll stop nodding off throughout the day and have a constant need to “nap”. I hope I’ll have less mood swings as well, because I def get opiate rage.

230,1i3pcgc,5 months. ,fuckyouyaslut,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1i3pcgc/5_months/,"I made it 5 months and 1 week today. Last December I OD’d for the first time after my first time using after a 3 month clean streak. It was also my first time ever falling out in almost a decade of using. Then a few months after that I passed out in public because I was so weak in withdrawal, that I split my face open on the sidewalk and got 12 stitches. Then a few months after that, I got clean for the billionth time (this time). 

This is the first time I’ve ever made it this far. I use Kratom to keep myself from slipping up, but lately even that feels like a cheat of some kind. Which seems ridiculous because the last few years have been hell trying to get myself off fent. So I’m trying to remind myself that I’m in a better place now. It’s not even a comparison. But I guess it’s a good sign that I feel this way right? 

I’m just not trying to get too over confident about any aspect of my substance abuse because I realize it only takes one fuck up to fuck up again. 

My life feels quiet and calm and stable for the first time and I’m grateful that it is. I’m working a lot and finding happiness in things I thought I wouldn’t give 2 shits about. Like people. And food. And activities I thought were “meaningless”, because I wasn’t getting high. I used to have to scrounge $100 daily before food, rent, any part of life. Just to get me through my day. Just to not get sick. I just couldn’t live my life like that anymore. 

I hope you guys are okay and I truly hope all of you in the middle of it right now are trying to take care of yourselves. <333",12
231,1huadmh,Day 500!,Deathofme_0,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1huadmh/day_500/,"Just hit 500 days sober today! The holidays are always a bit tough for me (since I’d always ruin them with my addiction in the past) but I’m proud of myself for getting through and happy to still be on my recovery journey after 15 years of addiction.

I’m also 80 days sober from weed which is another thing I thought would never happen. It’s funny, while opiates and weed are totally different (I have a medical card), the mindset is similar. On both drugs I thought I could never be sober, I would be awkward or people wouldn’t like me, I wouldn’t be able to survive really without them…but less than 2 weeks after stopping both; I realized the exact opposite is true. I find myself more present than ever, I feel less awkward in social situations, I’m saving even more money; and I’ve been progressing in EMDR therapy like crazy since stopping weed.

I was using weed to help stop my horrible nightmare/night terrors. While it was a good crutch, I got to a point in therapy where I felt stuck basically. I stopped smoking (only because I was trying to get a new job) and found myself making leaps and bounds in therapy I never thought possible. My therapist noticed almost immediately too! Even though I only stopped smoking for the job, I’ve decided to not start back up again! While therapy is still incredibly hard and I have a long way to go, I have made it SO far and I can’t wait to look back in another 500 days and see the results!

This year, my goal is to find an in person meeting that I can be apart of. I have been completely shocked to find how much solidarity and being around likeminded people helps me. I’ve always been someone who’s never really wanted to go, but lately I feel the need for support and want to capitalize on those feelings.

I hope anyone still in the throws of addiction that sees this, knows it’s really possible to get out, you just have to be ready! There are so many resources out there, and I’m always here and happy to help any/everyone I can. I thought I was alone, I could never be helped, and I was better off dead; but I was so wrong. 

And to my friends that are in recovery, keep fighting the good fight! I don’t post in here often these days, but I’m in here almost daily reading your inspiring stories and it helps more than you’ll ever know. Message me anytime for anything, and thank you all! ♥️",5
232,1hrlrpn,5 months sober and still hate my life and am completely miserable. Is there any way out?,lucyblu663,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1hrlrpn/5_months_sober_and_still_hate_my_life_and_am/,"I’ve been sober 5 months now and I feel like nothing has changed. I feel the same, live the same monotonous life that I realized very quickly only worked for me while using and feel like I can’t get out. I have no friends and therapy and the occasional meeting is not enough, but I feel like I’m incapable of reaching out and putting in the effort to find community and connect with others. I’ve realized I’m mentally ill and it isn’t going away with being sober, I’ve tried so many medications that often make it worse and have been on various meds and in therapy since 15. I feel like there isn’t hope for a better life and I’m so tempted to give up and start using again just so it can be easier to get through the days. I’ve lost everything I cared about and so many opportunities to drug use and despite being only 23 I can’t convince myself that it isn’t over for me already, it feels like it has always been like this and always will. My issues started long before substance use but I haven’t had more than a few days sober (until now) since 16. I don’t know how to live and no one is going to hold my hand through the process of learning how to be a person. I don’t have any motivation because I feel like it’s a losing battle and I’ll never get out of this hole I’ve dug myself. I have ptsd and it’s extremely hard to connect to other people and be vulnerable enough to make new connections and trust that it will be ok, so I find myself completely alone all the time as the rest of the world gets further and further away, and my world gets so small again. I felt like this often while using and was convinced it’d be better when I got sober but it isn’t. The small amount of progress I finally made that convinced me to get sober cuz I finally had hope for the future is completely gone. I keep finding myself thinking maybe it’ll be better on my next try, as if I’ve already given up and know I’ll be using again soon. I don’t know how other people function and move forward. I can’t stop thinking about everything that’s ever happened in my life and I live completely in the past agonizing about everything, I have nothing going on in my life and nothing to bring me out of my head and I’m too cowardly to move forward and find good things for myself and do anything I know would help. I finally got a sponsor last month and have stopped texting and calling, every time I reach out I end up not responding for weeks again, I don’t speak to anyone at work, I feel like a ghost. The only thing that keeps me going is the thought of leaving here forever and just forcing myself to live, I finally got my drivers license, renewed my passport, drafted my two weeks notice- but the end doesn’t feel any closer, I don’t feel any better, it still feels so out of reach. I don’t have confidence I’ll actually do it. In my head I think there’s two options, move in to sober living in another state, find a better therapist, new job, maybe iop- or drive for a while, get out, and come back and start using again until I have hope I can make it and do better. I think so much about using and the comfort of giving up and resigning myself to waiting and ignoring again. If I don’t try, I won’t fail, I won’t ever have to realize it really won’t get better. I’m so tired of waiting for something that may never come and trying for something I might never get and feeling like I’m failing cuz I’m not ever doing enough. Even in iop, going to meetings regularly, everything I was supposed to do I felt so trapped and hopeless. I just want to know there’s some end in sight, some light at the end of the tunnel and this all might be worth it. That I can actually turn things around and have the strength to do it for myself and it won’t be forever that I feel like this. Sorry for how long and depressing this is I just want to know that someone has felt this way and made it out",29

234,1ou1f7f,Day 30 Quitting Suboxone - My Story,Slada1,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1ou1f7f/day_30_quitting_suboxone_my_story/,"Today is day 30 since quitting Suboxone cold turkey. First off, I want to say thank you to everybody who has offered their encouragement over the last thirty days. It means a lot to me. Now, I figured I'd do something a bit differently today. I've given this some thought, but I'd like to share with you guys my story. I'm not entirely sure if this will help some of you out, but perhaps it'll add a more human dimension to the previous posts I've made. I know I've kept things mostly positive over the last month, but clearly I've made some mistakes to be in this predicament. Despite what the posts might suggest, I'm not perfect. I was weak. I struggled the same as everybody else dealing with addiction. Before I continue, there are some parts that might be triggering to read, so you have been warned. Here is my story:

Nearly a decade ago, I was essentially a model student and athlete my senior year of high school. I was a varsity athlete in two sports, my GPA was nearly a 4.0, I had 10 AP courses under my belt, and I volunteered often. I was in a relationship with a girl I had known for about a year at that point. I had a solid circle of friends who shared my interests. I even had a best friend who referred to me as a brother. We innocently started dabbling in weed and alcohol on weekends during nights where we'd hang out and play video games together. Eventually, my best friend started doing drugs alone. Unfortunately, I didn't see this as a sign of mental health issues. I was busy with life and college applications at the time, and he never approached me with his issues. That's usually how us guys are, so I didn't press him further on the issue. It's one of my biggest regrets to this day. I woke up one morning to frantic text messages and phone calls from mutual friends. My best friend had run away from home. I tried desperately to reach out to him, but he disconnected his phone. I prayed he would return. The only thing that returned to me was a message late at night from an unknown number saying ""thank you for being a good friend to me. I'm sorry, goodbye [my name]"". The next morning, police confirmed that he was dead. He committed suicide by jumping in front of highway traffic. This is the event that caused my life to spiral downward. I had lost the one person I truly considered a brother outside of my own family. The anguish in my heart never really faded from that day on. I was denied admission from my university of choice and went to another in-state college, but I hated it. There was a lot of crime and homelessness in the area which made it dangerous if not depressing. I also had to commute nearly 2 hours one way using public transportation which always had some crazy people on there. There was also the issue of traffic in the mornings and afternoons just to get to the metro station. In addition, I had to work part time at a shitty entry level job to pay for transportation costs which included my used car to get to the metro station. The professors at my university didn't even teach under the pretext of an ""inverse class format"", which was awful for STEM majors like me. The point is, I felt like I worked my ass off throughout my teenage years for nothing. I began to question my own existence. One day on the way back from classes, I met a guy I knew somewhat from high school. He said I looked beat, which I was, and recommended I try kratom. I had no idea what he was talking about, but he said it was this herbal supplement that helps with mood and energy. It sounded too good to be true. I decided to give it a shot despite being skeptical, so I stopped by a local smoke shop and purchased a small bag of white maeng da. That day when I got back home, I cracked open the bag and took two grams to try it out. About half an hour later, I experienced the best fucking feeling I have ever felt in my life. It was as if all the happiness and joy I could've felt from my accomplishments up until that moment were transformed into some green powder. Suddenly, the transits to and from college seemed a lot less bothersome. I didn't have any anxiety over tests anymore. I had more energy to study and work. I was on cloud nine. At the time, I had believed I found the cure for my declining mental health. Initially, even my girlfriend was happy I found something that worked for me. However, all it did was repress my real emotions and fatigue. About a year later, I suffered a mental breakdown and had to take medical withdrawal from all my college classes for the semester. My parents were encouraging and said I should take a gap year to take a break and reorient myself. I went with their suggestion, but I began to self-medicate with kratom even more. One day, I ran out of my stash. I told myself it was no big deal, until I started feeling sick several hours later. I convinced myself it was the flu until I bought more kratom and felt better after half an hour. A realization dawned upon me. I was addicted to kratom, a plant I thought was just an herbal supplement. Panicked, I tried to stop, but the withdrawals were intense. At this point, my parents began to notice something was wrong. They found my 250 gram bags and I had no excuses. They tried to take it away from me, but I'd always hide some more that I bought secretly. The addiction began to drain all the money I had saved from work. Then, COVID rolled around and I had no job. Even the unemployment money I got was spent towards kratom. Soon, I resorted to stealing. Not just cash from my parents, but kratom from gas stations when the attendant was gone. At that point, I was eating powder by the spoonful multiple times a day. I was a fucking fiend for kratom. My girlfriend who I had known for about four years during this time saw the writing on the wall. She tried to convince me to stop, but I didn't listen. I lied and made excuses, which eventually she caught on to. That was the last straw for her. She abruptly left me, saying she hated what I had become and never wanted to see my face again. Then, my parents who found out about the stealing were enraged. I overheard my mom tell my dad ""that's not our son. He's a monster"". It was only during that private conversation that I learned I was an accident. I was thoroughly devastated. At that point, I had nothing left to lose, and yet I was determined to lose the one thing I should value the most. I drank a bunch of liquor and stabbed myself in the throat with a knife. Thankfully, I missed my carotid artery by half an inch. I was found passed out and bleeding, but alive and taken to a hospital. Then, I was sent to a psychiatric hospital. I was put on Suboxone and Wellbutrin during my stay until two weeks went by and I was deemed fit for release. I was given another week's supply of Suboxone to taper down from and that was it. Little did I know, PAWS from kratom was lurking around the corner. It hit me like a tidal wave after my last dose of Suboxone. After a few days, I couldn't take it anymore and relapsed on kratom. My parents found out and kicked me out of the house. I was homeless besides my car, but at least I still had some money. It was a few months before I found a job, and another several before I found an apartment to rent with three other people. Life seemed to be shaping up to something better, but I was high on kratom all the time so it was hard to tell. My entire life at this time was just long shifts at a dead-end job to pay rent while the rest went towards drugs and other necessities. I wasn't just doing kratom at this time either. I was getting drunk and smoking weed almost every night. I also picked up a nicotine habit. Between that and work, I did nothing else. I didn't have any friends. My entire free time was spent doing drugs and lounging around in my small apartment room on my phone. Frankly, I thought I could live like this forever. That was until kratom began to affect me differently. I began to have noticeable body tremors whenever I was anxious, and then it shifted to having body tremors all the time. I couldn't function like a normal person in public or at work anymore. At this point it had been three years since I was kicked out on the street and five years since I first knew I was addicted to kratom, so I had likely damaged my body and brain. It was not until a visiting family friend who had known me since I was a kid met me one day and said ""Jesus, are you okay? You look sick"" that I knew I couldn't live like this anymore. I looked at myself in the mirror when I came back to my apartment that day. My skin was pallid. I had visibly dark circles under my eyes. I lost at least 20 pounds in weight. I was a husk of my former self. I truly became the monster my family said I was. I decided I had enough. I got a Suboxone prescription through telehealth and for the next five months I tapered from 4mg down to 2mg per day. At this point, Suboxone had also begun to show its own side effects. I was sick of it. I called my family and explained my situation. Thankfully, they were willing to take me back. However, it was on the condition that I quit all drugs with random testing as proof. That included Suboxone. I weighed my options. Did I really want to rot away for the rest of my life as a poly-drug addict at some entry-level job living paycheck to paycheck in a shitty apartment with multiple roommates? Or would I rather get clean despite the withdrawals with zero comfort drugs if it meant I could have a fresh start and regain the trust of my family? I chose the latter. Today marks the thirtieth day since I quit Suboxone, and also the thirtieth day I began to turn my life around. For once, I can say that I am a man who survived hell and is free from the shackles of addiction for good.

Hopefully my experience has resonated with some of you regardless whether you are just considering getting clean or are currently going through withdrawals. Just know you are not alone. It is possible to beat an addiction to opiates, even ones as powerful and long-lasting as Suboxone. If I can do it, surely you can too. Have patience and be kind to yourself. Eventually, you will be free. I'll see you all tomorrow for my last daily check-in.",10

236,1o6opim,From Kensington streets to home. What a journey.,brodney90,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1o6opim/from_kensington_streets_to_home_what_a_journey/,"""Your girl is almost here,"" he announced, his voice devoid of emotion. ""She's gonna watch you die"".

Those words were spoken to me while I was locked in a trap house as a woman's boyfriend kicked me in the head and ribs. They thought I had robbed them, and they lured me there to get revenge. This was just one of the moments from my nearly six years of being homeless and addicted on the streets of Kensington, Philadelphia.

It's a crazy story. I went from being a correctional officer to a full-time ""hitter"" on the street—a guy who injects others with drugs for money to survive. My life became a cycle of hustling, boosting, getting jumped, and running from the cops, all while battling an addiction to fentanyl and tranq that was literally eating my body alive with flesh-eating wounds.

I was completely hopeless and had resigned myself to dying out there. Then, during the brutal winter of 2024, I got severe frostbite and collapsed on the street. That single event led to a choice in the hospital: a long, painful, and uncertain fight to save my feet, or a double below-the-knee amputation.

Losing my feet was the most traumatic and horrifying experience of my life, but it was also the one thing that finally got me off the streets for good. It forced me into a recovery I couldn't run from.

Today, I'm home with my parents. I have my prosthetics and am learning to walk again, and my girlfriend Britiny is also clean and in a sober house. I've spent the last several months writing my memoir, *Kensington Beach*, to tell the whole unfiltered story.

It's been a hell of a journey. I'm open to answering any questions you guys have about addiction, life on the streets, recovery, or what it's like learning to live again.

I'd also me completely honored if you were to check out my work or even just my page. Thanks guys

Started at 17, I’m about 3 days clean at this point. For the last 3 years I didn’t even get high off the stuff it was just a bottomless pit I threw money into so I could remain functional. What’s messing with me rn is this constant restlessness and the fact I can’t sleep at all.

I don’t post often so here goes. 

Back in 2021 I wanna say, I started using oxy recreationally and eventually started using more and by 2022-23 I was shooting up heroine. 

I was in a very unstable and unhealthy relationship with a guy who had been using and got in to it that way. 

I ended up overdosing and coming back but didn’t even quit after that.. I vividly remember coming to and was being pissed that I fucked up my chance at getting well… 

I mentioned moving out of the city I was living in and moving closer to where I grew up to my family and they basically saved my life unknowingly. Because I moved to a city where I knew no one with the stuff I needed. They thought they were helping me get out of a toxic relationship, which they were but also before I overdosed and didn’t come back. 

I took the month before I moved to try to detox and ended up putting myself in withdrawal. I had a planned birthday vacation with my Mom in Vegas and before we left ended up in urgent care and then after we got back ended up in the ER again so she knew something was up. And so I ended up coming clean to her about everything.

There are only a select few people who know I ever used. The toxic ex and his friends. My very close group of 4-5 friends. My mom (she has tried to explain to my dad how rough of a situation I was in but he refuses to hear about it). And my now fiancé. 

So, I guess I just wanted to come on here and kinda say I’m proud of myself for not slipping and wanting to tell someone that IT’S FUCKING HARD EVERY DAY EVEN WHEN YOU ARE CLEAN FOR 2 YEARS! 

I genuinely have my friends and family to thank for getting me help out of the situation I was in. That’s my biggest advice for anyone on here looking to stay clean. Surround yourself with people who want to support you and won’t judge you! 

Thanks for listening! 
Stay safe and healthy!

I wish I never touched opiates because the feeling would’ve never interacted with my brain. If I never experienced that high I would have nothing to crave. Maybe I’m just feeling alone because my gf is back with her family for the summer and I’m so used to her being around. Maybe I don’t have enough going on in my life atm.

243,1krayt4,13 years clean and sober,skimask808,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1krayt4/13_years_clean_and_sober/,"Every once in a while I stop by in this sub reddit to share my story, to hopefully inspire the addict who is still suffering. It also gives me a chance to reflect on the things that worked and went well for me in my recovery, and the times I may have fallen short as well. To start, I am in my early 30's. I started using opiates when I was 14 years old. I remember because I was a freshman in high school. I was having a really rough time in school. Depressed, constantly anxious, and started hanging out with other people with similar issues. Surprisingly, most of my friends didn't use any substances. But I remember one day I was going through medicine cabinets at my house and I found a full bottle of 40mg oxycodone capsules. There were 120 of them. This is where it all started. 

The next week I skipped school most days, and got completely obliterated at home by myself. It was the first time in a long time that I felt truely happy and like myself. There was a switch that went off where I instantly recognized that I had found the thing I was looking for my entire life. My story isn't unlike many others, once the pills ran out, I realized I had a family member who had lupus and was being completely over prescribed opiates. Oxycodone, hydrocodone, oxymorphone, hydromorphone, and even at one point fentanyl patches. No idea what the doctor was thinking prescribing that much. But this set me off into full blown addiction. 

Eventually they noticed the meds were going missing after almost a year. So I had to find something else. This is where heroin came into the mix. IV use came shortly after. This went on for 3 or 4 years. Getting kicked out of my home, losing everything and everyone who loved me wasn't enough to stop killing myself with substances. Even losing my girlfriend of 5 years wasn't enough to stop. I pushed everyone away who actually cared, and continued using, almost to the point of trying to die for a long time. 

Then came the day I overdosed. Valentine's day, February 2012. I woke up in a hospital and a police officer was there. He gave me two options, they found heroin and needles on me and said he could charge and book me for possession of narcotics and paraphernalia, or I could check myself into inpatient rehab. Seeing my parents faces was enough to realize that this was my one chance to turn things around, and I might not get a second chance. So I checked myself into a rehab (surprising the best choice of one too) and started my journey to recovery. 

The recovery part could be a whole new post, but to try to wrap things up as quick as I can I'll just explain what's happened since then. I graduated recently with my bachelor's in Psychology, and am pursuing my master's in social work right now. Should have it in the next year or two. I got licensed in my state as a substance abuse counselor (in training).  I started working about a year ago as a substance abuse counselor, and got the opportunity to intern, and then work at the same rehab that saved my life 13 years ago. I give speeches to new patients weekly, play golf with the same psychiatrist that saved me in 2012 regularly. 

I still deal with cravings. Life still can get crazy and throw me curve balls regularly. But now instead of using I call a friend or talk to a loved one about what im going through. I cope with stress differently now, helping others truly does help me. What I am trying to say is no matter how dark things can get, remember that there is always a way towards recovery. In beginning it can be incredibly hard to stay sober, but after you have a little bit of time, it gets so much significantly easier. You can find out that you do deserve happiness and you do have something positive you can contribute to other people's lives too. Traditional 12 step groups work for a lot of people, but I didn't use them to get sober and don't teach too much about them when I'm running groups. There are other ways to stay sober. 

To the addict still suffering, and the ones who are just starting your recovery journey, keep fighting. Don't give up, no matter how bad things are. Things will get fucking tough before they get easy. But you will never know how great life can be if you don't stick with it. Reach out to people if you need to. And thanks for anyone who got through this jumbled mess of my thoughts today. Best of luck!",7
244,1jltklg,I’ve never experienced withdrawals this bad what else should I expect?,Reasonable_Spend_907,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1jltklg/ive_never_experienced_withdrawals_this_bad_what/,"
Hey i’m a 19 YO who had access to slow release oxytocin, oral morphine and codeine due to my step grandfather being very ill and i had to mind him overnight as he couldnt remain unsupervised. 

I live in the UK but i’m now back in Ireland visiting home for just a week the last opioids i had was slow release on Tuesday (18th) however even the morning of Tuesday (before quitting and taking my last dose) i was unable to eat my breakfast and barely ate that day at all over the few days of being off the opioids i felt like a normal sickness just a stomach bug but it lasted much longer than usual from Tuesday till Saturday and on Saturday is when things really kicked off 

i was throwing up even just sipping water it was horrible i don’t think i need to go into details you get the picture just throwing up for 48 hours while also getting about 6 hours sleep but again i thought this was just a sickness so on Monday i went to A&E (accident and emergency) to get checked they took bloods gave me fluids and anti sickness (neither helped a whole lot) which is when i started to suspect it would be withdrawals rather than just a illness 

the doctor gave me some prescription for stomach acid regulation which i’ve no idea if that helps in anyway or could even make it worse. the doctor also said if it continues or gets worse come back and so two days later (wednesday) i was the same not being even able to keep a mouth full of water down i went back and they said the exact same thing gave me fluids anti sickness and sent me on my way 

it’s friday now and im finally starting to be able to keep sips and a bite down but that’s literally it just one single bite of toast and two sips of water if ive more im in agony for a bit and throwing up all over again 

In short im asking if this is normal from opioid withdrawals from what i see online it’s pretty typical im just looking for people or have been through this and or have any advice on how to deal with the coming days even if they are much better than what i’ve already been though. Also sorry for the lack of and random punctuation im still in pain in my stomach from not eating enough and throwing up 

PS: i don’t have any negative feelings such as depression or irritation all the mental stuff i seem okay and able to handle it just seems to be physical which is also why i was thinking it’s just a sickness rather than withdrawal 

Thanks for anyone who responds i hope your having a wonderful day :) ",43

I started back on my Gabapentin and mirtazphine  which did wonders since my body was no longer used to it….the mirtazphine I didn’t need to take until last night….so i slept perfectly fine for 6 days….what helped the most was the canna felt like when I first started it…. i have detoxed a lot of times and always broke after day 6……this is the easiest detox i ever had….i kept telling myself the methadone is still in your system, you will feel it once it’s out…then day 5 came of no methadone and I still felt okay….now this method worked for me because i only took opiates….i was very careful during my binge and pulled out my test strip, and tested them in the car with the guy right there……im not sure if this will work for F…..now for the root of the issue when it comes to my addiction….i am diagnosed with adhd and i started getting a script for adderall last year, but never took it because I heard it dangerous to mix with oxys….so I just stacked them up….everytime I relapsed which has been a lot it was because of my adhd….I just wanted to feel “normal” so I self medicated….oxy was the only thing to somewhat help my adhd….this morning I felt good when I woke up….then the adhd started to mess with me….racing thoughts in my head started the anxiety…. I’m sitting on the couch looking at the mess the dogs made last night and I just can’t get myself to get up and clean it….so I decided I’m going to start on my adderall today and I wish I found this before the oxys….. I might have never fell addicted….my mind is finally quiet and I got up and started deep cleaning with the music on….I feel amazing I am focused and I have no anxiety…didn’t even take the Gabapentin today which is crazy…..I am so excited for the future…I’m proud of myself for taking that last pill and fixing the root of the problem…I am going to manifest it now, I will never use again!

249,1hu6xi4,Day 4 feeling…. Wow,Wheretheproblemsat,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1hu6xi4/day_4_feeling_wow/,"So here I am in the kitchen with my husband (we’re both on sub) singing the new lion king song totally forgetting that we were feeling like absolute garbage just 4 days ago. I’ve never had a withdrawal that hasn’t had me down for at least a few days before feeling somewhat okay. We both went to work like nothing was wrong, eating and drinking. Doing whatever we can to make sure that we don’t fall into feeling crappy. 

We’ve planned for activities both inside and outside so that we can stay distracted and won’t get bored because boredom or being stuck in your head can easily trigger a relapse. We’ve stopped taking naps so that we are tired enough by the end of the night to sleep throughout the entirety of it. Take showers to avoid RLS. And spend time in the living room with family instead of being in our room. Something needed to change, we needed to change. We were so miserable being stuck in our heads about what went wrong, seeing everyone live life. We need to do that instead of being upset that we don’t. The money used for drugs could be used to go to the movies, out to eat, skating, bowling, anything! But we spent it all on drugs and would be so sad and angry that we didn’t have money to do what other ppl our age are doing (23). No more, no more woe is me. I cannot guarantee full sobriety but I can guarantee that I’m done letting drugs dictate my life and I will do whatever I can to make sure I never fall victim to pills. I won’t let pills make me not want to go out, leave work early to go pick up, take off work because I hadn’t gotten more, make plans and not sticking with them because I was high at the time, and other bull crap. 

I will make it to every doctor, rehab, and therapy appointment. I will go out and try to make friends. I will continue to date my husband and flourish our marriage. I will work hard and earn money to help my husband financially take care of us. I will stay on my prescribed medications. I will live life and not be afraid of the world anymore. I have to. ",11

But today is extra special because today someone offered me Oxys and I, not even fully through the withdrawal phase and still truly miserable, turned them down.

I actually did it. I chose myself and my future over temporary relief. It doesn't even feel real to me. It seems so silly but for years I've watched people's sobriety journeys with such envy & frustration because I convinced myself I couldn't do it and I would inevitably die this way, but I did it. There's no guarantee that I can keep this up forever or even for another week, but today gave me hope that I might have it in me.

No numbing. No escape hatch. Just me. Raw. Ugly. Real.

She was 32 years old.
Beautiful. Brave. Funny as hell, smart, and my best friend. 
Four years clean from heroin. One year sober from alcohol.
Her name was Natasha.

What killed her wasn’t what most people expect.

It was CHS—Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome—made worse by Xanax, overprescribed by a doctor who should have known her history. And it all happened so quietly… until it didn’t.


What CHS Did:

She started vomiting randomly. For hours. Days sometimes.
We thought it was food poisoning. Then anxiety. Then maybe hormones.
Nobody told us weed could do this.
Nobody told us high-THC products can flip on you after years of use.
Nobody warned her that the very thing she thought was helping her… was making her sick.
The first emergency room we went to wouldn't even see us, she was scared and in pain.

What Her Doctor Did:

He prescribed her Xanax for the nausea and sleep.
Not once. Repeatedly.
Even knowing she had a past with benzos and heroin.
Even after we explained how scared we were about her slipping.

And I think…
I think while I was at work, she started using the Xanax more often. Quietly. To sleep. To rest. To escape the pain of vomiting, shaking, losing hope.
And she didn’t tell me.
Because she didn’t want to let me down.


Now I’m Driving Her Car Home. Alone.

She smiled at me the day I left.
I said, “Get better, baby cakey, so we can go on more adventures.”
She smiled and said, “We’ve got so many more to go.” 

But now she’s gone.
And I need you to understand this:

CHS is real.

Long-term weed use can hurt you.

Doctors don’t always listen.

And benzos aren’t harmless.

If you’re fighting this or someone you love is… don’t wait. Speak up. Push back. Taper. Get help. Tell someone.


I’m going to fight to hold the cannabis boards, doctors, and medical systems accountable. But for now, I just needed the world to hear her name. Natasha, please say her name out loud, please. 

She didn’t deserve this.
She deserved a future.
She deserved to be heard.

And if this post saves even one person from the same fate—then her voice still echoes.


Thanks for listening. I’m not okay. But I’m still here.
If you have questions about CHS, addiction, or grief—I’ll answer what I can.",78
3,1hisl61,I'm officially one year clean from opiates!!!,Hatefulthrowawayacc,142,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1hisl61/im_officially_one_year_clean_from_opiates/,"Since I was 16 years old opiates have been a monumental part of my life. I started by taking my mom's old oxys that she would stash for herself. But when that dried up I moved on to Percocets that I would get from my friends at school. The next two years spiraled into a never-ending cat-and-mouse game of me trying to hide my use from the people in my life. I went as far as to intentionally isolate myself from my family and my friends just so I could be alone and nod out for a little while longer. Sadly this habit was never discovered by my parents or any significant figure. I remember this time in my life vividly, and with that, I remember my attitude towards my addiction. The intense denial I was in still makes me say out loud ""What the fuck was I thinking"".

 And then one day in November of 2023 I od'd for the first time. I'll never forget the fear I felt when I found out what happened, in that moment I don't think I couldve spoken if I wanted to, all I could do was cry and hold myself. That was the very first moment I accepted what was wrong with me. I spent the better part of December 2023 detoxing and let me tell you, it was a new circle of hell. I remember thinking to myself that this was worse than active addiction, I could feel every part of my body heating up like I was in the hottest sauna of my life but simultaneously I was shivering and felt an instinctive need to get warm, for lack of a better term it felt like hell froze over. 

That's not me saying the next 11 months were any easier, it wasn't. Every little thing made me think of percs I remember sitting in class and feeling this overpowering urge to get high again. I felt so bad, it felt like every part of my body was tingling with an intense mental and physical pain, a pain that would only be relieved if I just picked up my phone and called my plug. But by some stroke of luck or maybe divine intervention (If you're big into religion) I stayed clean.

 And now here I am, 19 years old and officially one year clean off opiates. I still get those urges from time to time especially if I am bored at the house with nothing to do and I've accepted that this will be a factor that I will deal with for the rest of my life and I'm ok with it, but as I've gone longer and longer without using I've found more and more ways to mentally tell myself NO! Nobody in my life that is significant like my mom or my friends knows this fact about me so I figured this is the best place to share! I still smoke weed, drink and every once in a while I'll do psychedelics with my friends but I made this promise to myself: I will never use opiates for recreational use ever again! And I will do everything in my power to keep that promise no matter what happens.",37

I’ve gotten the calls, the kind that freeze your blood, and somehow, by the grace of God and some incredible doctors and nurses, he survived every one.

For a long time, I didn’t think he’d make it to 30. I’ve seen him steal, lie, disappear, and come back a shell of himself. And yet, he’s still here. Still breathing. Still trying.

And just last month, he became a father.

He still struggles. He’s not “fixed.” But something in him shifted when that baby was born. I saw it in his eyes, like maybe, just maybe, there’s still something worth fighting for.

I wanted to share this not because it’s a perfect ending, it’s not. But because sometimes we need reminders that it’s never too late to turn a new leaf. That the same person who’s burned every bridge can still build something new.

If you pray, I’d ask you to say one for him and his daughter. And if you’re still in the middle of it, still lost in the cycle, please know there’s still hope.

Even now. Especially now.

5,1pjd73e,"I'm trying to advocate for people in opiate withdrawal, because nobody should have to hang themselves to find an end to the pain.",Overall-Project-5910,110,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1pjd73e/im_trying_to_advocate_for_people_in_opiate/,"Emergency Access to Withdrawal Relief

Opioid withdrawal is not “just the flu.” People who haven’t lived it think it’s about some body aches or nausea, something you can grit your teeth through. But the reality is far more brutal. Withdrawal can feel like being trapped inside your own body while every nerve screams. It is panic, desperation, crawling-out-of-your-skin agony, and for many, a psychological torment that pushes them toward unsafe choices or even suicide. People hang themselves or overdose during withdrawal—not because they are weak, but because the suffering is indescribable.

Right now, in the United States, people in acute opioid withdrawal have almost no rapid, legal, humane way to get relief. Emergency rooms often send patients away with nothing. “Comfort meds” can only do so much. Methadone clinics require long lines, paperwork, intake processes, urine tests, and strict schedules—things a person in severe withdrawal cannot realistically navigate. Buprenorphine can be life-saving, but access is still too limited, too slow, and too dependent on finding the right provider at the right moment.

When someone is in crisis, time is everything.

We need a fast, legal, medically supervised alternative—something people can access immediately to stabilize themselves until they can enter a longer-term program. The system treats withdrawal as a moral issue instead of a medical emergency, and people are dying because of it.

Imagine if we treated heart attacks or asthma attacks the way we treat withdrawal:
“Sorry, come back at 4 AM for intake.”
“Try again when we have time.”
“You’ll just have to suffer through it.”

This is unacceptable.

People in withdrawal deserve:

Emergency access to safe, fast-acting medication that prevents crisis, self-harm, overdose, or relapse.

A walk-in, no-barrier stabilization option—just like urgent care—staffed with medical professionals trained in addiction medicine.

Policies that acknowledge withdrawal as a true emergency, not a moral failure.

Legal and accessible medications that offer immediate relief while someone waits for a full treatment intake.


We already do this for countless other medical conditions. Why not for opioid withdrawal, where the stakes are literally life and death?

If we want to save lives, reduce suffering, and give people a real chance to recover, we must treat withdrawal with the urgency and dignity it deserves. No more turning people away. No more making them wait hours or days while their bodies and minds are on fire. No more preventable deaths.

People deserve compassion.
People deserve relief.
People deserve a system that doesn’t make them beg for help while they’re fighting for their lives.",65

I was looking for something last night in my attic and I came across a bunch of empty sub wrappers. My inner junkie said ""look in them, maybe you left a piece in it!""

You went through everything to be here right now .. flush it."" I walked downstairs and flushed it. The symbolic part of it was I took a shit earlier and thought I flushed but it didn't actually go down so I dropped the piece in a pile of shit then flushed. Obviously subs played an important role in being sober today but going back out of nowhere to get high is shit. Fuck that.

A perspective that has recently came to vision for me and it put a nail in the coffin that is my addiction.       
       
Hi everybody, I’m Problyurdad_, and I’m a heroin addict. I’m going to be 42 years old this year. I first dabbled with heroin back in 2008, the same way many of you did - I got injured at work a few years prior, and was sent home with what should’ve been a ten year supply of opiate pain meds that I burned through in about 4 days (hyperbolic relief, it’s okay to laugh) and turned to the streets when my doctor wouldn’t supply me any more pills, because I wasn’t doing the physical therapy because physical therapy made me feel better and I didn’t want to feel better I wanted pills.            
        
Back then, fentanyl was just starting to rain on heroins parade. Most of the dope we could get our hands on smelled strongly of vinegar, it was light brown, and it made you feel like you were warm and cozy wrapped up in a blanket with a smile on your face. It made you feel good!  It didn’t make you itch. It didn’t make your eyes and nose run. It didn’t give you rosacea. Most of all, it didn’t make you a raging psychopath with wildly unpredictable behavior that you couldn’t remember or control.             
        
In fact, all it ever did was make the day better. I could work harder, faster, longer, and I (thought) I found a drug that finally made me feel great again. Normal, so it seemed. Until the fentanyl started creeping in.       
       
And now, in hindsight, I’m glad it did. Because when I was on heroin cut with fentanyl, I was a much different person. People could tell. I could no longer hide my habit. My behavior was too outlandish. For example, one of my best friends stayed over one night after a concert. He slept on the couch. Before bed I went to the bathroom to shoot up. That’s all I remember. But according to him, I wrapped toilet paper around myself and came back out to the living room and brought it to him as a present. He had to guide me back to my bed. I woke up around 4 am and he wasn’t on the couch and I didn’t know why. He had left after that because he didn’t want to be around it. I don’t blame him.          
          
I went rehab later that summer (2019) and had 5 years of sobriety under my belt before I got the itch to dabble again. And dabble I did, and once again my behavior immediately gave me away. I did things I can’t even tell you because I don’t remember. But my kids saw, my wife saw, and that was the end of that. I dabbled for about a week and then checked right back in to the hospital, never to look back again. Because now I know, and now I am 100% aware, that whatever it is I am looking for from heroin is long gone. Those days are over, and I can’t even get my hands on what I would traditionally say is my drug of choice, the experience I’m seeking, the feelings I’m trying to feel….         
        
If you’re thinking about using again, don’t. Whatever it is you’re looking for isn’t there anymore. The experience you want is long gone. You’re not going to be able to hide it, and it’s not going to be what you have in your head as an idea for it anyways. It’ll be way different and the only thing you’ll gain from it is experience, and another time you wish you hadn’t picked it back up again. Trust me. I know. ",25

I don’t want pity, I just want to say this out loud: recovery isn’t just quitting the drug, it’s rebuilding the pieces of yourself you burned away. That part feels just as hard some days.

I was about 96 hours sober from heroin. I was actually feeling pretty good besides the back pain. No other symptoms other than back pain. I made a post in here about having back pain and someone recommended 7-oh, so I got a pack of pills. 


I took one last night and I felt fucking fantastic, pure bliss. I took another this morning and felt great..it last about 4 hours. It worked great... Too great, but when I woke up I realized I woke up sicker with withdrawal symptoms that I thought had went away. 

Did deeper research this morning and come to find out, it doesn't just work like an opioid, IT IS AN OPIOID. No different than heroin, percs, morphine, etc. so after it wore off I felt more dope sick than before. So not only is it an opioid, it's 22x stronger than morphine and 4x stronger than heroin. It literally took me back to day 1 of my detox, except the withdrawals were way worse than before. 

Update: I got a bag of H last night. But I don't consider it a relapse... More like a reset. Give those stupid pills enough time to get out my system, just a week, and then stop again. I can handle heroin withdrawals anytime, but the withdrawal I felt from those 7oh pills were just completely unbearable. I couldn't function at all. 


So just putting this here to warn others. Don't take it unless you've completely detoxed from your DOC.

I was recently banned from the subreddit for brining up the fact that it has a lot of religious reference and mention of god, as well as congratulating someone who posted about being clean from hard drugs while still smoking weed and sharing my own situation.

The moderation team made it explicitly clear that it is not a place for questioning their own narrative and have no qualms about silencing someone who goes against their own status quo.

I was told that, as a member of NA for 10+ years and someone who was born and raised within the rooms that I was not welcome there.

I mentioned how their ban actually violated their own rules and they proceeded to mute me.

I’m sharing this as a warning because all it takes is one power tripping mod to shun away a struggling person and they could end up triggering a relapse causing someone to overdose.

In fact I will be writing to the narcotics anonymous head office to lodge a complaint about an online community using the Narcotics anonymous name in an unfortunate way and it sends a bad message to any would be newcomer that maybe they would get kicked out of the in person rooms too if they said the wrong thing.",70

Man that was a solid 2 weeks a real shake rattle and roll followed by another 2 months of just generally feeling shitty but still I was excited. I spent my entire adult life a lying piece of shit junkie so at 31 I was completely unsure of where to start or what to do except stay off dope. At 7 months clean I successfully moved out of my parents to a city I always wanted to move to and did is the right way. But something unexpected happened. I met someone I wanted to start a family with so we eventually moved back to where I was from and got us a cute little house just a bit from Lake Michigan. I thought life couldn't have been better, like I never thought I'd be spending my days after work loading up the car with a cooler and my sweetheart and driving to the beach for an evening swim. You miss out on that shit when you're spending your time after work hustling up more money for a bag or chasing shitty d-boys around town ya know?

And it's not like there's been no bumps and it hasn't been hard as fuck a lot of time it really has but I just react differently to it now. I also got to mention the gratitude that a person has after getting clean. It's seriously unreal. Like every single thing is amplified in how good it feels knowing I was so close to never having that joy ever again. I really thought heroin addiction would kill me and resigned myself to it for a while as most of us do right? Well don't resign yet.

I would argue that the process itself—the act of contacting a dealer, meeting them at a designated location, acquiring the drugs, and returning home—can be just as addictive. There is something inherently thrilling to the human brain in engaging in activities we know are illegal, yet manage to execute without detection, evading the government’s reach. This illicitness creates a sense of euphoria in itself.

I have heard of countries such as Portugal and cities like Amsterdam, where drug use has been decriminalized, and interestingly, abuse rates are lower compared to when substances were criminalized. The thrill that comes with the illegality of the act seems to be a significant factor in the addiction; when drugs are legalized, that thrill diminishes, making the substance itself less enticing. Additionally, there is a certain euphoria associated with the ability to acquire what one desires when so many are disconnected from access, unable to obtain what they need when they need it.",63

",Ok_Intention6827,64,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1hwv1f7/threw_almost_four_years_clean_down_the_drain_put/,"Back in 2020, I went to rehab after a year long OC80 habit. At the end I ate three to four of those blue fuckers a day, it was terrible. I did the whole nine yards: got clean, moved cities, went to university, got a prestigious internship and finished my bachelors thesis with highest grades. All great, everybody so proud, but all along I was feeling like shit. I was young when I went to rehab, and I was in such a rush to get out in the world and prove everybody wrong that I didn't gave two fucks about what caused my addictive behaviour.

Some months back, in June, I started taking benzodiazepines, I guess it was for anxiety symptoms. i never did it to get high, only in normal doses per se. Don't think I've ever taken over 40mg diazepam over 24 hrs. I made a deal with myself: hand in your bachelor thesis in December, then seek help. And that's what I did. I'm in the midst of a taper with my local addiction center, and on that front it's great something is being done. They might even offer me some therapy.

A few weeks back, although, life took unexpected turns. I was crushed, emotionally and financially. I bought an OC80, did 40mg, saved 40mg for the day after and nodded the fuck out for two days. The warm blanket felt exactly the way I remembered it. I know why I did it, but I regret it just as much as taking that first benzo back in June.

It was in the mid of December, today is January 8th, and I just did it for I think the tenth time or something like that. The 20mg don't get me nodding anymore, 40mg barely does. I can go two to three days, sensing no withdrawals, but then I do them again. As mentioned, this has been going on for some weeks.

I went to this sub for so much advice, support and comfort back in 2020 and 2021 when I was in active addiction and in my recovery phase. Now I'm on the steps of a nasty oxy habit again. Apparently, I can't get into my head what it is I'm doing. I did around 50mg tonight, and I plan of doing the rest. It will be the last pill, but I said that the last time and the last time again.

This may sound so fucking dumb, but please, someone, remind me why we don't do this shit. Remind me why this is the direct pathway to misery. Remind that I'm better than this. Remind me there's still a turning point without going through the whole nine yards again. I'm not sure I can do that.

However, I've never done street fent, and never plan on it. I was a pharma opi to real heroin addict, through and through. 

With that being said, I used to smoke gel fent patches back in the day. Wasn't my fav, but it when it was available, I used it. 

Hadn't thought about fent patches in a very long time.. until last week.. when I had this thought 'hey, you don't fuck with street 'fent', and that's good.. but imagine if it was the year 200x and you had access to fent patches. Wouldn't that be cooooool?'

The absolute shock when I reached down at the end of my block and picked up a sealed malindkroft 25 mcg/hr patch.. MAN. 

It felt trippy. Like, the universe whispering in my ear.

""Here, want to try? Try.""

Not even a fucking ounce of desire once it was in my hand. 

Immediately walked down to the encampment down the block and gave it away.. couldn't exactly bring myself to destroy it. Technically harm reduction for someone smoking street fent lol

What a trip. Hadn't seen one of those in over a decade. Never thought I'd see them again. 

Feels liberating, in a way. I don't even regret it now that I've calmed down. I've had some past experiences where I ditch a substance in these sorts of scenarios and regret it deeply like 10 mins later. 

Truly a trip

Edit:

Thanks so much for the love, everybody! I have a tendency to invalidate myself, and really didn't even see it as an 'accomplishment' of any sort until y'all convinced me it was. 

Something inside of me fights me hard when I attempt to be proud of myself, but I'll keep doing my best to recognize that my actions were a manifestation of years and years of hard work. I didn't just 'not have desire to use it'.

31,1libd6j,Opiate withdrawal,Economy_Succotash751,57,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1libd6j/opiate_withdrawal/,"I asked chatgpt to write a description of what withdrawals felt like. It understood the assignment...

Opiate withdrawal is a deeply physical and emotional ordeal — a storm that tears through the body and mind with brutal clarity. It often begins like the onset of a severe flu, but it quickly escalates into something more punishing and unrelenting.

In the beginning, there's a creeping unease, a gnawing sense that something is wrong. The body feels tense, wired with nervous energy. Anxiety starts to rise, like a drumbeat in the chest, accompanied by yawning, watery eyes, and a runny nose. These may seem minor at first, but they signal the opening notes of the full symphony of suffering to come.

As hours pass, restlessness sets in. Muscles ache, deep in the bones — not like soreness from overuse, but a crawling, burning tightness that won’t be soothed. The skin feels too tight and too sensitive all at once. People often describe it as feeling like ants are crawling beneath their skin, or like their body is trying to tear itself out from the inside.

The gastrointestinal system turns traitor. Nausea churns in the stomach. Cramps twist the gut with merciless precision. Diarrhea becomes relentless. Appetite vanishes. Vomiting may begin. It feels as though the body is purging itself, desperate to rid itself of toxins, but in doing so, it strips away comfort, control, and dignity.

Sleep becomes impossible. The body is exhausted but won’t rest. Every attempt to lie still is disrupted by chills that shake the spine, followed by waves of sweating that leave the sheets drenched. Legs twitch uncontrollably — restless leg syndrome becomes maddening. It's like trying to sleep while being electrocuted from the inside out.

Psychological distress builds alongside the physical. Anxiety intensifies into panic. Depression creeps in like a heavy fog. Thoughts become chaotic, dark, and hopeless. Cravings claw at the brain, screaming for relief, for the drug that could silence this pain. There's a profound sense of despair — not just over the withdrawal, but over the realization of how tightly the drug has coiled itself around every system in the body.

Time distorts. Hours feel like days. Every second is felt acutely. There's no distraction strong enough to cut through the agony. Some people cry. Some rage. Some stare blankly, barely able to speak.

Eventually, the storm begins to ease — but the emotional weight may linger long after the physical symptoms subside. Guilt, shame, fear of relapse, and a shattered sense of self often remain. Even in the calm, the memory of withdrawal haunts like a ghost.

Opiate withdrawal isn’t just discomfort. It’s a full-body rebellion, a psychological unraveling — and for many, a terrifying glimpse into how powerfully these substances have taken hold. But with support, safety, and care, recovery is possible. Even from this.

I remember him opening it and seeing all these written messages inside and I think it mighta been the first time I had even seen a yearbook.  All the messages said things like What's up Ganja _____ STAY HIGH my brother, your best friend.  Or ""I'll never forget the first time tripping with you"" or ""Signed, the ______ bar boyzzz"" CHEERS!  My brother was laughing n so excited reading it like HOLY SHIT I can't believe this is dad's!  We grew up hearing about the trippy 60s, the art, how drugs were such an influential part of that era.  

Growing up, it seemed like any movie kids wanted to see in the 90s- and did - romanticized tf outta drugs.  Every time someone smoked, popped a pill, hit a vein, the cinematics would intensify n it'd usually be attached to something very emotional or powerful in the movie.  Almost every kid I knew, I'd heard say, ""I'd try that once if I could"".  Well, I was raised very strict and though my parents drank at parties, I never saw any drugs at the parties.  By the time I was 12, I was smoking cigarettes, as were most of my friends (strangely, it was kinda normal for kids to go through adults coats for cigs at a party even at that age, we'd try to hide it but it was almost like ""looks like the kids found some cigarettes they're smoking out there"").  Even into the 2000s some movies, especially about teens, the whole basis of the movie would be how they were getting x, y, z for a party or for whatever.  Soon after, I tried weed.  Then I got my first bf who was a huge drinker n he was older.  I began drinking daily.  

The house in my neighborhood that we used to chill at was full of teens n young 20s in n out non stop, all my friends, all way older than me.  The dude who lived there's mom was almost never there n when she did get there she did crack in her room n didn't seem to notice or care that her son had turned her house into the equivalent of an illegal drug den, I mean, we graffitid artwork all over her fkn walls...  When she was friendly which was rare, it was usually cuz we were holding something she wanted.

My freshmen year in HS was absolute hell.  I was finally out from under my parents very tight watch and I just remember being angry all the time at every fkn adult that had something to say to me in that building.  Almost daily the deans would pull me in the office, go thru my backpack, steal all my sharpies n paint markers n spray paint.  Graffiti was a huge part of my life at the time and I was the only girl I knew who went bombing n they just kept taking all my shit. I remember how I felt when he'd open my new pack of Newports and break them all in front of me over the garbage while barking at me and I was INFURIATED.  I'd walk out every time, meet up w my bf n start drinking.  They kept kicking me out of every hs I went to cuz I never went.  I was now at that drug house drinking from 7am to midnight every day.  Doing every drug that came through.  Never went to Sophomore year, just dropped out n kept going to that house every day.  It was only a few blocks from where I lived.

Then my bf went on vacation with his family but I kept going there cuz all my ""friends"" were there.  They had been scheming and I had noooooo fkn clue, what a stupid little girl.  The first day my bf was gone I remember this tall guy who was half black half Italian n had always seemed like one of the more normal dudes who'd only come thru once in a while....he was walkin towards the house w a huge bottle of vodka and I was sitting on the porch w my 22oz Heineken.  He said wow!  Thank God you're here, I got this for you!  Which was suspicious at first n I was like why?  And he said remember that night last week?  You gave me so many of your Heinekens and cigs so I got you this to repay you.  I figured he just stole it for me n I was like alright cool thx.  He said, I'll brb I'm just gonna run in n make myself a quick drink, I gotta go, you can have the rest.  

I don't know what happened after that first sip but I woke up and I couldn't move.  I opened my eyes and I was in a house I'd never been in before laying on someone's couch and the room was full of men, wall to wall.  I was naked.  They put a dropper in my mouth n I went black again.  I was kidnapped, raped repeatedly.  Somehow didn't end up pregnant or sick with anything.  It was the biggest secret in the neighborhood and every guy knew, soon their gfs were finding out ""I had fkd their man"".  I got into so many fkn fights, couldn't go anywhere in my neighborhood, fought nearly every girl I ever knew.  But I was too something ... scared..  proud... fkd in the head to tell anyone what really happened those 3 days.

That was the breaking point I think.  I was determined to be as numb as possible at all times cuz I had nobody to talk to about this, I didn't know what to do.  And, tbh I felt like a pos, like trash, disposable, to be used n discarded.  Around that time I just started going to bars and clubs every night.  Made new friends, got more fucked up, bounced all over NYC til 4 am every morning.  I had fun, so many good times, but plenty of pretty bad ones too.  Then, sometime while I was still doing what I was doing I got into a really bad car accident.  My doctor prescribed me Oxy 30s 3x a day.  I finally found my FAVORITE drug.  Kept running out he kept giving more, more, more.  Until one day I show up and he says I'm sorry, I can still give you the spinal shots but the meds you were on I can only give to cancer patients now.  I was pretty angry about it tbh cuz these pills on the street weren't cheap n I had a HABIT and a fkn half.  I decided whatever I'll just get them if I see someone has em, guess I can't have em every day anymore.  I was at a friend's house when all the sudden I thought I was dying, I panicked and told my friends something was wrong.  They were asking a million questions and I remember mumbling something about stopping the pills n maybe that's why and one guy was like OXY?  YOU'RE IN WITHDRAWAL!  YOU COULD FKN DIE!  YOUR DR DIDN'T GIVE YOU ANYTHING?  SUBOXONE?  I didn't even know what a suboxone was bro I was so like, uninformed about this shit.  I just knew I was gonna die that night and I layed down.  Not even 5 mins later the same guy comes in the bedroom n he's like you sniff coke?  And I'm like yeah u got?  He's like no, sniff this n you'll feel better.  That's ALLLLLL I had to hear I didn't care if it was rat poison just make me feel like I'm NOT dying PLEASE.  It was heroin.

So, I replaced the pills with sniffing heroin.  All I knew in my empty stupid head was keep doing this at all costs, you won't die.  I became his dealer's top custy.  For years I always kept a tight circle of dope friends.  I had met a girl who I got along with for once.  We became best buddies, basically did everything together, tried to quit together at a Methadone clinic, kept using.  By that time I was using needles.  We both got to a point that it was getting really hard to find a vein that worked anymore.  She got a bad infection in her right arm and it was bad enough she was hardly able to move her arm.  I kept telling her she had to get it seen cuz it looked really bad but since it was always covered I'd forget about it then realize again and ask if she went to the dr yet and I really don't know why she wouldn't just go to the hospital n let them patch it up, fix it, whatever had to be done.  But we were on a constant chase for dope and it just took a backseat, one day right as I dropped her off in front of her house, she said something to me, that for the first time ever, since I knew her, made me mad and not just mad, but I peeled out off her block as she was holding her stomach.  3 hrs later she texted ""I'm in the hospital call me plz"" and I guess I assumed she was at the ER for her arm but I remember just throwing my phone back on my bed like fk u bitch I've been saying let's go for months now you decided to go the day you pissed me tf off?  Get fkd 🖕

She was dead by the morning.  Sepsis.  I lost my fkn mind.  The guilt.  The only female friend I ever cared about is dead and it's my fault.  I was so consumed with my bs that I didn't just make the appointment for her like a good friend n take her.  And my last words to her before she died was ""good, u dumb bitch, keep letting him rob u then, I'm not saving you next time your shit is gone"".  

She had no family at all but one sister who had written her off eons ago.  I called n told her that her sister had died and she said good and hung up.  She had absolutely nothing, nobody, that cared but me.  I was her emergency contact in the hospital.  I did the best I could with what I could, paid for everything I had to, got her ashes.  I couldn't stop crying for weeks, so many regrets, so much pain, there wasn't any amount of now, fent - that would stop my eyes from puddling up constantly.  I sat in my childhood bedroom again, a total mess.  Surrounded by ashtrays, bottles, needles, stamp bags all around me.  I stayed in bed killing myself slowly, and paying a high price to do it.  In my head for some reason I was thinking I had only been doing dope for 10 yrs.  I stayed alone for 3 yrs for the most part, couldn't enjoy partying anymore.  Every day I hoped I'd get a bag they measured wrong or something and I could just be at peace.

Then one day I got a phone call from this really cool kid I had met at rehab once.  He was the only one not trying to get in my pants and we had a great time in rehab together, so I picked up.  He said hey and asked how I was n he told me he was 5 yrs clean.  He was off the streets and in college.  It didn't even sound anything like the guy I remembered.  He was in the rooms, doing the work and doing a good job.  He kept begging me to make a meeting n I was stubborn.  But I finally decided after the new year I'd get clean.  He kept checking in on me n it helped me stick to my plan.  So I went for it when the time came.  I was so tired of feeling sad, so tired of paying to kill myself slowly.  I didn't have the balls to jump off my roof.  I had already tried.

I knew I didn't wanna be back in that methadone clinic w all the dope dealers outside n everyone still using and I had read about the Bernese method and just said, it's time.  I was pasted to my bed for 9 days, truly thought I might die but I didn't even care, I was NEVER touching that garbage again, no matter what it took.  I feel like all I kept saying to myself was ""tomorrow it'll be 5% better"".  I must have said it a thousand times and I finally fell asleep that 9th night.  I woke up and I could sit.  It was over.  I smiled so big and looked up, and thanked my friend.  I love you so much. I'm so sorry I didn't do the right thing. Thank you, God, I love you.  I cried tears of pure joy for the first time in my life.  It was so powerful, the only thing I could imagine could be like what I was feeling was giving birth.  I was SO HAPPY.  SO HOPEFUL.  I don't think I had ever felt real hope before that.  

Today is my 36th day off fent, subs, and every other pos garbage I can think of.  Thanks for reading, if anyone bothers to.  

You'll never be able to succeed until you're ready...it's true.  Until you've really just become so disgusted with yourself and your life that you can push through it.  My best friend died in '22 and it's '25.  Once I got clean I realized I had been on dope not for 10 yrs, but 22.  Please, look for a sign, look for hope.  Go to a meeting.  This has changed my life in such an enormous way.  All I ever remember knowing my entire life was pain.  I can finally feel again.  When I talk to my nephews, I can feel their joy and it makes my heart smile.  I promise you.  It's better on this side.

I still drive by that drug house multiple times a week.  Neighborhoods change, people change, even the house looks a bit spruced up and every time I see that family on the porch or going into the house, I thank God that they have no idea how much young laughter happened in that house as we all were killing ourselves.  My biggest regret is that my friend, my best friend that I ever had, had to die before seeing that life could be beautiful.  All we needed to do was stop looking for it in the wrong place.  I love each and every one of you and there's a place for you here, right next to me.  I'm not scared, I'm not sad, I'm actually at peace and I promise, you can be too.",16
33,1j0s1k1,Why methadone is so strictly regulated in the US,Low_Music_9744,57,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1j0s1k1/why_methadone_is_so_strictly_regulated_in_the_us/,"
I just started going to my local methadone clinic, and I find it extremely idiotic that they require you to go every single fucking day for years. And it's not just the issue of going but also waiting 1 to 3 hours each day (at least in my area). This is completely absurd—I don't know how anyone would be able to hold a job while having to attend the BS clinic every day. I can only conclude that the U.S. doesn't actually want to stop this ""opioid epidemic"" and that these centers are just there to make a profit, not to help.

For context, in my home country (Colombia), you only need to see a primary physician, usually a toxicologist, who will prescribe a month's supply of methadone that you just need to pick up at your local pharmacy. And this is the way it’s done in a lot of other countries. Mind you, Colombia is supposedly ""third world,"" and even so, paying for both the physician and the medication will only run you about $100 per month.

With all this in mind, I ask: Are there any plans to update these outdated and backward-ass regulations in the U.S. regarding methadone? Are these regulations coming from the government, or are they up to the methadone clinics’ discretion? Is anyone doing anything about this? And if not what would you recommend me to do, because I definately do not intent to keep wasting 2 hours each day (more than I wait on my dealer) and spending nearly as much as I did in dope.

This has been the toughest war with my own mind I’ve experienced yet. Doing this all on my own without any outside support from anyone at all has been a significant challenge.

The only really good news is that I no longer feel sick. The bad news is that dealing with the post acute symptoms is harder than the initial 2 week sickness. I have terribly low energy & lack the motivation to really do anything at all. I’m also trying to be comfortable with being more bored than I’ve ever been. Yet everyday I sit here and daydream about rebuilding my life, meeting new people and building new connections, but I lack the get up and go to even start. 

I know that asking how long this will persist is like asking how long is a piece of string, but I’m just so desperate for the old me to return, the energetic, outgoing, sociable & hard working me. I went from a guy who never took a day off to struggling to even maintain hygiene. I’m positive hormones are contributing to this, probably low testosterone. If so, would a doctor prescribe it to me, or just tell me to wait for it to return to base level naturally? 

Anyway, the 24 days closing on a month is somewhat of an achievement I guess. But more importantly I’m desperate to not waste any more time after three years of isolation so any advice on what I should expect for the near future regarding low energy & low mood in general would be much appreciated. 

Summer is coming up & I just want to feel somewhat normal again.

And someone, pretending to be a true friend, said, “I’ll introduce you to Miss Heroin.” Well, honey, before you start fooling with me, just let me inform you how it will be. For I will seduce you and make you my slave; I’ve seen men much stronger than you go to the graves.

You think you can never become a disgrace and end up addicted to poppy seed waste. You’ll start inhaling me in one afternoon; you’ll take me into your arm very soon. And once I have entered deep down in your veins, the craving will nearly drive you insane.

You’ll need lots of money, as you’ve been told, for darling, I’m much more expensive than gold. You’ll swindle your mother just for a buck; you’ll turn into something vile and corrupt. You’ll mug and you’ll steal for my narcotic charm and feel contentment when I’m in your arms. The day when you realize

The monster you’ve grown, you’ll solemnly promise to leave me alone.
If you think that you’ve got that mythical hack,
Then, sweetie, just try getting me off your back.

The vomit, the cramps, your gut tied in a knot,
The jangling nerves screaming for just one more shot.
The hot chills, the cold sweat, the withdrawal pains
Can only be saved by my white little grains.

There’s no other way, and there’s no need to look,
For deep down inside, you will know you are hooked.
You’ll desperately run to the pusher, and then
You’ll welcome me into your arms once again.

And when you return, just as I have foretold,
I know that you’ll give me your body and soul.
You’ll give up your morals, your conscience, your heart,
And you will be mine until death do us part.",15

I know what it feels like to fall down over and over again. I know the weight of relapse, the guilt, the shame, and the lie that tells you, ""You’ll never get clean."" But I’m living proof that those are lies.

I’m a recovering addict with 4 years clean from opiates. And I promise you—you are strong enough to recover, no matter how many times you've relapsed. Recovery isn’t about perfection. It’s about never giving up on yourself.

You are worthy of recovery. You are worthy of love. Don’t let anyone, including your own mind, tell you otherwise.

If you're reading this and you’re fighting for your life, know that you’re not alone. And if you ever need someone to talk to—whether you’re clean, using, or somewhere in between—my inbox is always open.

For the ones who want to get clean but can’t shake the fear of withdrawals, the pain, or facing life head-on without a crutch.

I’ve been there. I’ve sat on the edge of the bed, sweating, shaking, crying, praying for it to stop — but also praying I don’t go back to using.
I’ve been that dude who thought I was too far gone.

I’ve lost people I love — one recently took their own life — and I ain’t gonna lie, it messed me up bad.
I still deal with chronic pain every single day. I still got demons that whisper in my ear.

But almost 5 years clean from opiates later, I’m still here.
Still fighting.
Still refusing to go back.

And yeah — I’ll keep it real with you — I still smoke weed.
It helps with my anxiety and pain. It keeps me grounded.
Some people won’t agree, and that’s okay.
But it keeps me alive and off the poison that once had me chained.

I still count myself clean because I don’t use to escape anymore — I use it to cope and function, not to disappear.

Getting clean ain’t about being perfect.
It’s about surviving long enough to heal.

You don’t need to have your life figured out.
You don’t need to have a degree, a job, or a support system.
You just need that one thing — the desire to stop dying and start living again.

That’s the spark.
That’s what saved me when nothing else could.

To the PhD who’s popping pills in secret, and to the kid who dropped out and is nodding off in a trap house — I see you.
You both deserve recovery.
You both deserve peace.
You both deserve to look in the mirror and not hate who you see.

Don’t let fear of withdrawals or fear of life keep you from the freedom you deserve.
Yeah, it’s gonna hurt. Yeah, it’s gonna suck.
But that pain? It’s temporary.
And on the other side of it is something you might’ve forgotten existed — hope.

You’re not weak for being scared.
You’re strong as hell for even thinking about changing.

If you’re reading this, it means you still got fight in you.
And that’s enough for today.

One day at a time.
Keep pushing.
Keep breathing.
You’re not alone in this.

From loved ones, from your job, from everything. Everyone is afraid of the withdrawal, I went through fent withdrawal more time than I can count and always went back to it to scratch that itch.

Spending all of that money on bunk shit most of the time, unless you are one of the rare people with a fire plug with good prices. Regardless, it’s not worth it.

I've been severely addicted to both drugs. At my worst I was on 40mg Xanax per day, and I've also been addicted to IV heroin. I think opioid withdrawals are worse because of how many debilitating symptoms there are. 

With benzo withdrawal, the only symptoms I'd experience were anxiety, paranoia, insomnia, depression, and sometimes migraines. I know that sounds like a lot, and don't get me wrong, this all was terrible and could sometimes make me feel crazy, but that was pretty much it. All the symptoms seemed to stem from anxiety. I never had vivid hallucinations, never had a seizure (was on anti-seizure meds), and even at my worst I could still function 1 day completely off benzos if I replaced them with soma or pregabalin. 

Whereas with opioid withdrawal, there's so many symptoms that drive me nuts. The yawns, sweats, flu-like symptoms, RLS, anxiety, depression, diarrhea, puking, insomnia, fatigue, and the CRAVINGS. I'd get decent cravings when going through benzo withdrawals, but they were pretty easily alleviated if I just used soma or pregabalin. Whereas there's nothing that can really subside the cravings I get for opiates. It feels like nothing else matters at the time. 

I'm 9 days completely tapered off benzos for the first time in 6 years, and I have no cravings for the stuff. I rarely think about it, and when I do it's just me being happy that I don't have to use the crap anymore. ",115

Isn’t that kind of ironic? We’re all here because opiates wrecked our lives in one way or another. None of us should be casting stones. The fact that people feel the need to shut down someone’s experience just because it doesn’t line up with the “accepted” recovery path is awful.

Not everyone’s recovery looks the same. Some people thrive on MAT, others don’t. That doesn’t make their story less valid.

I get the mindset, I think, rip the bandaid off, suffer through it, earn your stripes. But I honestly don’t understand why you’d want to go full CT when your body and brain are already completely wrecked from opiates.

Like… you're already sleep-deprived, depressed, in pain, dopamine’s on vacation, your nervous system’s fried..Why make it harder than it already is?

I'm not talking about going on MAT or trading one thing for another. I'm just asking:
Is there any real benefit to making it as brutal as possible?
What’s the upside?

Is it about pride? Feeling “cleaner”? Punishment?
Or is it just not knowing there are other ways?

Not saying CT doesn’t work. I know it does for some.
But if you're already mentally and physically hanging by a thread… why add gasoline to the fire?

Genuinely asking out of interest.
Maybe there’s something I’m missing. Not here to argue! Just trying to understand what drives people to choose CT over other options.





Just to be clear this post wasn’t about sharing my story, I was just curious how people did it cold turkey (no MAT, no kratom, no psilocybin).

I personally used kratom, psilocybin and other natural supplements and vitamins to get off oxy, heroin and benzos, so I’m not claiming I did it without help.

I’m almost 14 months clean now and don’t use anything anymore — just smoke some weed and trip on shrooms 2–3 times a year.
Feel free to keep sharing your experiences! some of them are mind blowing!

I just want wanted to write to you all.

I am 14 years clean today. I have no one to tell, because no one in my life really knows I ever used. I did heroin for 3 years, averaged a gram and half a day, IV. This was right before fentanyl came into the scene.

I quit cold turkey one day. I laid in my mom’s bed for days, the bone pain and restless legs is what I remember most. My hair was matted by the end of it, I ended up hospitalized later in the month due to some electrolyte problems.  I never went on mat medicine.  I understand some need it, but I didn’t want to have to get off something else.

I’ve never relapsed. I left everyone I knew in that scene behind. I became friends with people who didn’t do hard drugs (I didn’t think that was possible). My life is just a life, nothing special. I never went back to college. I’m doing okay. I still have dreams that I use once or twice a year, but it’s fine.

I guess what I’m saying is, keep going if you’re struggling. My life is so much better not feeling sick every other day because the dealer is out or worrying where I’ll get my stuff from . That alone keeps me clean, that was the worst experience in my life.

It gets easier, I promise.

I (24f) am 6 months sober after 5 years of opiate use and 4+ years of addiction prior to that. I’m so jealous of people who've built a beautiful little life for themselves with friends they love and have known for years and full of things they love doing and a sense of home and community and wonder. Who know what they like to do for fun and see people regularly that they know and care about. Have passions and interests and goals and plans for the future and what they want to do even if that's just more of whatever little things they enjoy. 

I feel so lost, I don’t have anything I like in my life and have wasted so many years losing any kind of joy and now I just have to be here??? And figure it out??? Find shit that l like doing when I've spent so long hating everything and doing nothing and talking to no one?? I've ruined like 95% of the relationships and opportunities l've had and I just have to start from scratch now? So many other people who did drugs that Ive talked to at least had something to go back to in their life.

what am I supposed to do with all this nothing???? I am so full of nothing and my life is full of nothing and I can't stop doing nothing and wanting nothing. Like great now I want more in theory, but what does that do for me right now besides make it more painful to have nothing??? And I don't enjoy anything. I can't think of anything I want to actually do. I give myself a goal and I get there and it's like- great, now what? It doesn't mean anything. I'm completely alone and I don't care. Why should I care about my life marginally improving when there's no one to share it with and it feels completely meaningless.

I think of my future and it's like this- I could go finish high school/get my ged, go to college, move away, but I don't actually find any hope in the idea. Then I'd just be in school, still hopeless. I'd just be somewhere else, still me, life still bleak. I got my drivers license finally, got promoted, am trying to talk to people more, make an effort, reach out- but it all feels so empty and trite. It doesn't mean anything to me, I can't connect with anyone, I don't know anyone. When I talk to people it's forced. I don't have anyone I speak candidly with. it's going to take so much work and I don't have the energy, yeah I know I can eventually get there but what am I supposed to do until then and how long exactly is it going to take?
I don’t really fully believe it’s possible for me. I’ve always struggled with or had complicated relationships with people, I’ve been mentally ill since I was a young teenager, and I’ve never gotten over anything that’s ever happened in my life, and now all of a sudden I’m an adult who can’t cope without hard drugs, flooded with everything I never dealt with and this horrible constant void of loss in my chest, with absolutely nothing to look forward to, no light at the end of the tunnel. 

Most people my age still talk to their high school friends, have connections to the world- I know I’m young, but I feel so old. I’ve wasted my whole life so far and have no idea how to pick up the pieces and move forward when I’m so painfully ill equipped and behind compared to my peers. The last time I was sober this long I was a child. I have no idea how to mourn the loss of an adolescence I barely remember and accept that I’m an adult I don’t even recognize with apparently no capacity for joy. Everyday I feel lost and confused, I don’t feel real. I’ve spent so long closing my eyes and standing still that I have no idea how to move forward or live my life, and any time I do make a change I can recognize, it’s terrifying and I want to run back to the safety of stagnancy. 

The only thing that gets me through the day is living in fantasies of the past that can never happen. I don’t want to be so old at 24 and so young somehow, too. The grief of who I was and could have been, and the friends I’ve lost to overdose, or to my own poor choices, the things I saw and experienced so young, it’s unbearable and I have the emotional regulation skills of a 14 year old. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m in therapy, I’m on medication, I go to meetings, I’m even trying to exercise and take supplements. I hate taking care of myself, I want to be better but I hate everything that gets me there. I don’t want to white knuckle my way through life. I’m tired of being alone with all my nothing.

To every addict and recovering addict out there—especially those battling opiates—this message is for YOU.

No two paths to recovery look the same. Some of us fall a hundred times before we ever get back up. Some lose everything before they find their reason to fight. But no matter how deep the hole you're in, recovery is possible.

You don’t have to do it perfectly. You don’t have to have all the answers. You just have to take the next step… and then the one after that.

You are NOT too far gone.
You are NOT hopeless.
You are NOT broken beyond repair.

You are stronger than you know, more worthy than you believe, and capable of change beyond your imagination.

I’ve been through the fire. I know what it's like to feel like you’ll never make it out. But I’m almost 5 years clean now...

When you’re ready—truly ready—to stop using, your healing will begin. And with every day clean, you’ll remember what it feels like to be alive again.

Keep going. You’re not alone. And you’re not weak for struggling—you’re powerful for continuing to try.

✊ You’re worthy of recovery.
❤️ You’re worthy of love.
🌟 And your life is not over—it’s just beginning.

Took some advice I saw here and booked a QuickMD appointment and just had the worst experience ever. I guess I’ve been lucky because my old doctor was so kind and understanding- I really felt heard when I spoke and truly felt like he cared about my well being. This QuickMD doctor didn’t even treat me like I was a human- first off only part of her face was even in the frame which I thought was odd, she was immediately rude to me for no reason, had no interest in what I had to say when trying to explain what has been going on and what meds have helped me in the past. Kept sighing when I’d ask a question as if I were wasting her time and her answers were so condescending and short. She was just so cold and uncaring I don’t understand why a Dr who was on an app specifically for prescribing suboxone would treat a new patient like this right off the bat




Writing this out now it doesn’t even sound that bad, I wish I were better at describing the attitude of this doctor and how awful she was- I’ve never been made to feel so small by a doctor before and it just made me feel really sad. I don’t even know why I’m posting this, I guess i just have no one else to talk to about something like getting off drugs that’s so hard already, and then feeling so dismissed by someone who was supposed to help. I got my sub script at least I guess, I just didn’t expect to feel like shit about it",38

76,1je6nnc,A junkie's creed,[deleted],35,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1je6nnc/a_junkies_creed/,"I've spent probably 14 years of my life off and on opiates and I'm on a low dose maintaience now. I'll never forget being almost a year clean when i read a post, I think on reddit from someone who was years clean, almost a decade.

 It started like a speech from a speaker in NA. Very anti-addiction, hopeful, and grateful, then slowly crept into territory of realism, and finally collapsed into a full blown love letter to Heroin, like an ex-lover from your 20 somethings you thought would be the one, and you've since ""moved on"". Have a wife and kids, or vice-versa, yet that memory still lingers and the slow crawl and simple pleasures of life don't seem to scratch that same itch. This person literally went from saying they were so glad to be clean, and ended the post by saying they might go cop literally at that moment. 

It was pretty heartbreaking to read because it really made me wonder, if this person is still feeling this way after almost a decade clean, will I ever not at least, kinda miss opiates? That was when I was about 22-23 and I'm 33 now. What the fuck man, lol. 

I say all this to say that I think the hardest part of giving up opiates is the realism that as far as knew. When I was maintaining, not obliterated, and not sick, just a happy medium between, and usually when I first relapse, people gravitate toward me, and the opiates make it very easy for all the awkwardness of social interactions to fade and transform into opportunities for friendship and even romance. Of course, to keep up with this long term becomes even more difficult though. 

It makes me feel like it's a double edged sword because opiates aren't like alcohol where people can clearly see you're under the influence and so they disregard the vibe your putting out. Opiates hijack the endorphin system and work behind the scenes to manufactor what appears to everyone else like genuine love, happiness, and desire. So long as you don't take it too far and look like an actual junkie or the people interacting with you don't know the telltale signs, but even then they'll tend to want to believe in that portrayal. 

The hardest part of being a junkie wasn't/isn't the maintaience of it. It's being comfortable and instantly in control of how you feel or need to feel, in any given situation, while watching the rest of the world chase the thing you have complete control over. It's like that monolouge in Trainspotting when he lists off all the things ""normal"" people chase. And in the end we're all chasing the same feeling, junkies just found a shortcut to that feeling. 

I'm not saying it's smart or right, we risk death, isolation, and suffering worse than death. No matter how on top of it we'd like to think we are and i realize that after 14 years with each year getting more out of control quality, price, and potency wise. 

Who knows maybe it's a different life for a junkie in somewhere where you can literally just buy pure, pharmacy grade opiates legally. I'd imagine so, but maybe that access would just make it worse since we all crave the control, and limitless control would probably not end too well, but i guess who knows. 

I'm kind of just rambling around the point though..

The point of this is, i got to a point in the past 3 years where I just felt like. Well..maybe this is my purpose in life..to be an example and a voice of reason, even if I can't help myself, maybe i can help people around me, and reason with them. After all I'm living proof, if you can't listen to me, then who tf are you gonna listen to? You're not gonna listen to people in sobriety, and you're not gonna hear out the people who've never lived it. I was content with that for a while, but in the winter it would get pretty lonely. And finally the few people in my family that still cared smacked me with reality and no amount of dope would block the pain of that dissapointment. 

It makes me look back at everything I just wrote and think.. Who tf do I think I am? Jesus or something? Lol. I probably felt like a god on opiates but in all reality was I ever really perceived like I felt I was? Was it even the opiates to begin with, or was it just my excuse to be comfortable with who I really am to begin with? Do I have am endorphin deficiency naturally? Wtf even is normal? Do normal people feel like how I did on opiates or am I just not content with feeling how normal people feel? So many questions dude...lol. 

BTW, I'm on 4mgs of methadone daily now, so idk I guess I'm just trying to confront myself and my addiction and really get to the root of everything. Trying to find a way to reclaim the life I built on opiates..without opiates. But every junkies just addicted to themselves technically and metaphorically. We're not addicted to ""opiates"" we're addicted to endorphins. We're addicted to love, happiness. Isn't everyone? Or...are they not? 

Fucking life man, what a contradicting ride it is lol",40
77,1ien71u,Feeling sorry for yourself.,Rurfy_The_Riftdog,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1ien71u/feeling_sorry_for_yourself/,"Try not to get so paralyzingly hung up on wasted time, missed opportunities, regrets and the like.

If you are an addict, it is almost certain that you have essentially thrown away some significant portion or aspect of your life. Wasted something that you will never get back. I also wouldn't be surprised if that thing you wasted ended up being something incredibly precious to you, and the thought of that loss is soul crushingly difficult to cope with psychologically. It sucks.

Don't get me wrong. Regret is important. It serves a logical evolutionary purpose. It is a powerful indicator that is easily remembered. A quick reference alarm for you to use in the future to avoid the regretful mistake a second time. But we're addicts. I don't think it's a stretch to say we tend to take things to extremes. To excess. 

Regret is worthless to you if you wallow in it. Just like with our addictions, too much of something is almost always horrible. Every day you spend feeling sorry for yourself is another wasted day. Another day to Regret later. 

Do you want to come to the end of your life regretting the fact that you spent your entire life regretting all the things you fucked up? I certainly don't. I'll keep my Regret, but I'm going to use it to my advantage, not my detriment. I hope you do too.

Does anyone have any particular regrets that they've had a very difficult time coming to terms with? Something that just needles you whenever you have a quiet moment alone? I love to hear about some of the things you guys are dealing with and what it has taught you. ",17

But anyways, I’ve spent the last 4 days with one goal above all - to survive. Just make it through the next hour. Then the next. It was a clear mission…now, the acutes are basically all gone. And I don’t really know what to do with myself. The thought of leaving my room, my sanctuary, my battleground makes me anxious. I skipped another day of classes because I couldn’t make myself get out of bed. After a few hours of bedrotting I just made myself go to the store at least and get a new vape, but I just feel dissociated from real life. It’s a very strange feeling.

That I experience during acute withdrawals?,prince_kittenzzz,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1l0ksr4/can_anyone_relate_to_the_sense_of_bliss_that_i/,"Obviously we all know withdrawals suck hard. But the last few times I kicked, I noticed that at some point (or several points) during the process, I’m overcome with a sense of hopefulness/contentment/appreciation of the most minuscule beauties of life. I can only think to compare it to a profound realization that comes over you during an influential psychedelic experience. Sure my stomach’s in knots, I have a full body sweat/shiver going, but ya know… I think everything is gonna work out just fine. I know this feeling won’t last forever (or could it?). But it’s oddly cathartic and I never notice anyone else mentioning this. 

My best theory is that it’s simply because my emotions are finally being let free after being dulled for so long. Music hits so much different. Just appreciation for life in general. another chance to become a better version of myself grateful for this life and despite the hell addiction has put me and so many others thru, i genuinely believe i needed to experience it in order to truly appreciate what i do have, including the power to become any version of myself that i choose, provided i put in the required work. 

Anyways sorry for rambling. I’m about two days into my detox from heroin, using 7oh and alprazolam sparingly to make it possible to make it thru the last two days of work. I know it’s going to get worse before it gets better but I wish everyone the best in their journey of life, and hope you realize how much potential you truly have at any given moment. Much love!",29

The clock strikes three, the world's asleep,
Yet here I lie, the cravings creep.
A whisper calls, a ghostly pull,
That old dark hunger, never full.

Four long years, I've walked this line,
No pill, no high, just heart and mind.
I fight the urge, I stand up tall,
I won’t go back—I’ve seen it all.

For me, I stay, I choose the light,
Through every storm, through every fight.
But there’s a fire that burns so bright—
Her name is River, my guiding light.

Her laughter lifts me when I fall,
Her tiny voice, my wake-up call.
With little hands, she holds my heart,
Reminding me I’ve come too far.

And then there’s you, my love long gone,
Crystal, lost but never gone.
I swore I’d rise, I'd break the chain,
To honor you, to bear the pain.

Some nights are good, some nights are war,
But I won’t knock on death’s old door.
NA gave me tools to fight,
I use them all, I hold on tight.

I walk with God, He leads my way,
Without His love, I'd fade away.
Now passion fuels the steps I take,
To help the lost, to heal, to break—

The chains of others, just like me,
To show them there’s a way to be.
So when the cravings start to bite,
I pray, I stand—I win the night.

normally i would call my guy, but i moved and changed numbers when i got clean, so there is no guy for me to call (which is for the best). however, i live 15 mins from one of the largest open air markets on the east coast / mid atlantic. i hopped in my car and drove to the city. the whole drive there i felt guilty and gross. but i ignored those feeling and pushed forward. i drove down the main stretch and turned down the side streets however no one was posted, cops were out in full force (an officer was murdered a week ago).


with no luck finding anyone and the guilt getting stronger, i decided to turn around and head home.  i couldn't stop thinking about getting jammed up by the cops, how bad i used to look from picking my face tweaked out on rock...how paranoid and schizophrenic it made me feel...before hoping on the highway i stopped at a corner store and parked up with no plan in mind. 

this ""down on his luck"" looking dude walked up to my window and asked me if i could buy him a soda and some blunt wraps. so i did, i don't mind helping someone out. when he came out i asked him if he knew where i could score a 20 of rock. he knew a spot..he told me he was gonna run to the house across the street and grab it, and he would be right back. he didn't ask for my money, he just told me to wait. after he walked away a cop pulled in and parked next to me, cop ignored me and ran into the store. 

i left immediately and drove home. i took the cop arriving as a sign to not go thru with the deal. by that point the guilt and self hatred had filled my body.

i'm currently sitting in a wawa parking lot typing this before i spend that $20 on dinner. 

idk who is going to read this but thank you for letting me vent to you. i don't have anybody in my personal life who i can tell this to and keeping it inside makes me feel worse. i live alone with my dog and have virtually 0 friends, and currently can't afford therapy yet. typing this out makes me feel a little better. love you all thank you for reading my message as i try to work thru these feelings",31

I won't say this is a success story because it's ongoing and mainly I don't want to get too cocky, but we should celebrate every minute we're clean. I have actual hope for my life which really trips me out. I can't remember how long it's been since I've felt that. I'm not buried by my shame and guilt. My focus isn't in my past only paying attention to what's behind me. Those chains aren't holding me back anymore. For the first time in my life I have found real acceptance for myself. I can unapologetically be me. 

Recovery actually seems possible to attain. One day at a time. One hour at a time. One minute at a time. I've found NA to be a lifesaver for me but I don't want to preach. I just want to say it's possible. We owe it to ourselves to scrape, claw, and fight for our freedom. We owe it to ourselves to exhaust every option to arrest our disease. We deserve to live life clean. We are all worth it. As hard as it to believe that sometimes, we are all worth it.

I think I'm grieving everything I've ever felt in my brain that made me content. I don't even know what I'm trying to say anymore. I just want to be happy, and I want to feel like myself.

This marked the start of a decade long battle with opioid addiction. The script was stopped cold turkey about 18 months later but by that time I was already deep into addiction territory. I have stopped/started over the years but never really had any inclination to fully quit. About a year ago, I moved onto dihydrocodeine, which I buy from an online pharmacy. I go through withdrawal hell every single month due to the restrictions they place on ordering, and I hate it. I receive a monthly prescription of Gabapentin for genuine nerve damage and I always take them too fast in order to enhance the high from the pills, then I leave myself to suffer the nerve pain for the rest of the month, which also sucks. 

I am down to my last few dihydrocodeine pills and my plan was as follows - 2 this morning, 2 this evening, then 3 tomorrow morning as a “treat” because tomorrow is my birthday, then I’m out until I can re-order. I’m already experiencing some withdrawals due to the dosage decrease but I know they will hit full force once I fully run out. After I post this, I’m going to email the online pharmacy I purchase them from and ask them to disable my account. 

About an hour ago I found this sub and out of curiosity read a couple of posts. A couple turned into a few more, then a few more and now I’m sat here re-evaluating my whole life. Reading the heart-warming, inspiring journeys from those of you who have quit (and those of you who are in the process of doing so) has been nothing short of an epiphany for me. I’ve realised that I don’t want to spend my life in a cycle of opiate abuse and withdrawal. I don’t want to feel like the only way I can feel happy and experience joy is by chemically altering my brain. I don’t want to find out that a friend has recently been prescribed some opiates for a genuine medical reason, then spend the rest of my day subtly mentioning this “pain” I’ve been having in a way to build up to asking for some 😭 

I have a little girl who deserves a mum that doesn’t cycle through phases of being energetic/happy/full of life to fatigued/irritible/feeling ill each month. 

I will have to do this on my own as my husband and family have no idea about my addiction. I have been hiding this for 10 years, which has been stressful in itself, and also something that my husband does not deserve. 

I know that there will be 1000’s of tips if I search this sub, but if anyone wants to drop them here too I would be grateful. Saying that - one of the most irritating (but not worst) withdrawal symptoms I always face is a runny nose. Is there anything that helps with this? 

Anyway, I know that in terms of addictions, mine is on the milder end of the opiate spectrum, but it has been hell for me nonetheless. So, from the bottom of my heart I want to say thank you to each and every one of you. You are all inspirational and without this sub I’m not sure I would have ever reached this decision. I’ve honestly never felt determination like it. I know it won’t be easy, and there will probably be setbacks and road bumps along the way, but I really don’t want to live like this anymore. 

Good luck to those of you on your own journeys to sobriety and a huge well done to those of you who have already reached it. Love to you all 🩷

I came out of rehab with the mindset that I want to to give sobriety a go and obtain full abstinence from all mind/mood altering substances. Not even 2 weeks out I picked up Kratom. Then found some sleeping pills, started taking those, then started having the odd drink out. All while living with my parents telling them I’m sober. Then I picked up pregablin and got caught the next day. Now it’s been a month since then and my life is coming together, I’m back in the gym, running, got a job, starting my last year of varsity. But my emotional regulation is fucked, and I’m still using sleeping pills, Ritalin and had 1 relapse on oxy. 

There are days like today where I feel immense sadness, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, and all I want to do is use oxy. I think the only thing that’s stopping me, is the fact that I live with my parents. I know that if I was left to my own devices, I would have picked up ages ago. I dont want to be feel this way, I don’t want to use oxy and fuck my life up more. But I feel so overwhelmed by everything and just want it all to go away, and feel safe. Don’t get me wrong there are good days sober, but the bad, are really bad. And I see no way or point to carry on with life without using. I feel lonely, my confidence is shattered, I don’t have many friends that I can see, my gf broke up with me whilst I was in rehab, I’m yearning for connection. 

I don’t know how to navigate this, I know intellectually getting sober is the right thing to do, and I want to. But emotionally I cant win. Life feels too hard sober, and I ask myself, what’s the point. 

Anyways there my vent, hope you can relate Please please please, don’t use opiates if you haven’t already, they will flip your life upside down forever, within the blink of an eye. ",49

I’m 20 years old and currently 8 days clean from opiates. I’ve been in a clinic and I’m doing my best to rebuild my life and get through this.

I wanted to ask: when do the withdrawal symptoms and mental pain start to ease up? I’ve read a lot of posts saying things get better after about two weeks is that really the case?

Right now I’m on pregabalin, and while I was in the clinic they also gave me Valium to help with sleep, since I’ve had severe sleep problems ever since I was a kid. Sleep is still rough, but maybe slightly better than it was.

Yesterday I forced myself to go outside, get some sunlight and move a bit. It wasn’t easy, but I think it helped. Should I be pushing myself to do that more often, even when everything in me wants to stay inside?

I’d really appreciate any advice or hearing how things went for others around this point in recovery. Thanks for reading.",65

It was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done both physically and mentally. For a while, I actually felt free. I was clean. I thought I was finally done with this cycle.
But about three weeks ago, I slipped. I fell back into daily heroin use. At the same time, I started a new job, trying to hold things together on the outside while everything inside me started to fall apart again.

Now I feel stuck. I don’t want to go back on methadone it messed me up physically, and I promised myself I wouldn’t return to it. But I also can’t keep doing this. I’m tired. I’m scared of spiraling deeper, and I’m not sure how to break this pattern again

I’m sharing this not for sympathy, but because hiding it only feeds the shame. If you’ve been here too if you’ve relapsed, if you’ve felt hopeless, if you’ve gotten clean and then lost your grip I want you to know you’re not alone. I’m still trying. I’m not giving up. I just don’t know what the next step is right now.

I'm so proud of myself for getting on MAT and getting my life back together.

  
Last year, my account would have shown around -$800. Yes, negative. Since I get weekly direct deposits, my bank would allow me to overdraft up to $800 on my account. As I'm sure you can guess, this was awful and left me in and endless cycle of overdraft fees and debt. I would get my weekly pay (roughly 1k USD) and since I was so in the red, I'd end up with about $150 - which would right away go to my dealer. Then I'd spend the rest of the week trying to scheme some money until payday. I make $77k a year but was always broke and scrounging around my car for change to put some gas in.

  
My bank also has an get your pay early feature. Only issue is, it wouldn't always be early. Sometimes I'd get paid Wednesday, sometimes Friday. So you can imagine how it felt when it wouldn't come Wednesday.

  
I've been on MAT since December of 2024 and I can honestly say it changed my life. There was always a stigma when I'd ask about MAT, usually something along the lines of 'you're just getting addicted to something else!'. However, if you're already addicted to fent/blues, what's it matter? At least this way you're not waiting 45 minutes in a sketchy neighborhood getting 'im around the corner' texts. You're not worried about where you'll get your next high. You're not worried about getting some bunk shit, spending all your money, and still being sick. In my experience, I haven't had a single negative effect from the Methadone!

  
I went from spending up to $300 a day on blues to now getting bi-weekly takehomes and only paying $55 a week. It's truly changed me as a person and helped me develop better habits. Getting high or getting sick is no longer on my mind. 

I'm able to be present for my beautiful girlfriend and my awesome dog. I'm able to give them anything they want, whenever they want! I'm able to setup all my bills on auto-pay! I'm able to save money! I'm able to get anything I want!

104,1j8lk4n,12 Years of Heroin Addiction: My Journey to Recovery and a New Life,[deleted],31,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1j8lk4n/12_years_of_heroin_addiction_my_journey_to/,"Hello everyone. I’ve been on this sub for a month, and I’ve read some stories that have really touched me. Every time I read your stories, I see myself reflected in them in some way. Deep down, I believe that we, the addicts of the world, form a kind of brotherhood

Today, I want to share my story. I hope that someone can relate to it or that it helps someone make the decision to quit drugs. If it helps even one person, that will be enough for me.

The first time I smoked heroin was one night in early summer 2008. I was struggling with depression, tired of not having any excitement in life. It was a conscious decision. I was 22 years old, freshly graduated from university, and I didn’t know what to do with my life. My friends were starting to build something meaningful with their lives and were drifting away from me. And on top of that, my girlfriend had left me for another guy (I don’t blame her—the other guy was simply better than me, and she was very considerate, trying to make sure the breakup didn’t affect me psychologically). I felt very lonely and miserable. I had tried other drugs before—mainly cocaine and speed—but I hadn’t gotten hooked on any of them. However, I knew heroin was different. I knew it even before I started using it.

It was easy to get started. I just went to the neighborhood in my city where I knew drugs were sold, bought some, and used it right there in the same house. A girl who was using there guided me through the process of preparing the drug. Later, we became friends. I liked the feeling I got from heroin (I’m not going to go into more detail here). The next day, I woke up at noon, and the first thing I thought about was going to buy more. I remember being fully aware that if I gave in, I would fall into a deep, dark pit with no easy way out. I held out until 3 in the afternoon, and at that hour—during the hottest part of the day, in the hottest summer on record in my area at the time—with my body and mind sluggish from the sun and the scorching air, I thought, ‘Screw it,’ and got dressed to go buy more.

What followed, for twelve incredibly long years, was exactly what I expected—the full package. A series of highs, withdrawals, escapes, struggles, misery, happiness, sadness, absolute depression… A total chaos of emotions and experiences: car accidents, hospital admissions, family gatherings ending in tears, stealing from my parents, getting fired from one job after another… Summarizing those 12 years in a single paragraph feels so surreal. Every day without drugs was like an entire lifetime—it was as if my life was on pause and wouldn’t resume until I got my dose. Everything revolved around heroin. I would sit down to watch a TV show, and my mind would be focused on getting drugs. I’d go to work and only think about finishing my shift so I could go buy some (some days, I even smoked at work). Then, when I used, I felt completely guilty and miserable. Many times, I didn’t even get high—I just did it to feel physically okay.

Luckily, I managed to hold up physically. I put my body through infinite stress from cycles of use and withdrawal, from which I’ve fortunately come out relatively intact. But psychologically, I ended up devastated. It wasn’t until 2020 that I finally managed to detox completely.

I have to say that at no point during those 12 years did I feel like a victim. I suffered a lot, I regretted starting, of course—I cried rivers of tears—but I knew that I and only I had chosen that path. And I had done it with full knowledge of my actions.

Today, I’ve rebuilt my life. I’m far away from drugs (my only current vice is vaping, and I’ve also quit drinking alcohol). I live alone with my cat, and I have a good job. What I went through during all those years now feels very distant, yet at the same time, it’s as if it all happened just yesterday. I don’t let my guard down—I’m still very afraid of relapsing, but for now, I don’t think that will happen, even though I still have bad days. I feel like I’ve lost 12 years of my life, my entire youth, and that I’ve become a more cynical and less joyful person. I’ll probably never get those years back, but I’m okay with that. Thanks to my psychologist, I’ve managed to make peace with myself, and my parents have forgiven me for everything I did, but I’m still very hard on myself for some of the things I did. I still have work to do moving forward. But that’s okay—I have the strength to do it.

If you have read this far, thanks!. I don’t care where you’re from—whether it’s the USA, Europe, Australia, Pakistan, or anywhere else—you're important to me. I apologize if I’ve made any grammatical mistakes—English is not my native language (I’m from Spain), and although I speak some English, given how long this text is, I translated it using AI.

Lastly, I hope all of you manage to break free from drugs. Living without them is worth it, even though the fight is so hard.

Greetings to you all.",11

112,1i0nzhv,One week sober ,[deleted],30,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1i0nzhv/one_week_sober/,"For the first time in three years of taking opiates daily, I’ve made it through an entire week sober. It’s a milestone I never thought I’d hit, and I’ve been reading so many stories on this sub, both inspiring and heartbreaking but that has been a huge source of motivation for me.

I know my story isn’t unique. I’m in the same position as millions of others, I have a good life. No one knows about my addiction, but it’s been quietly tearing my life apart. Over the years, I’ve withdrawn from friends and family, stopped going out, and became a shell of myself. The changes were gradual, so subtle that people around me didn’t notice.

Last year was the worst for me. I isolated myself almost completely. Even when I did see people, I couldn’t wait to get back home. My entire life revolved around finding, stocking, and planning for these pills. I didn’t see myself as an addict but just as someone who needed them, like anti depressants. I didn’t want to post here until I had something to show for it or until I could say I’d made real progress.

Now, after just one week sober, I’m starting to feel like myself again. I know it’s still very early, but I’m feeling back to myself. 

I know this isn’t the kind of post that’s interesting—no robberies, no dramatic rock bottom. But I think that’s the point. Most addicts aren’t the stereotype we think of. Many of us live in nice homes, hold good jobs, and keep up appearances. We don’t talk about it because of the embarrassment,  (that’s why I’m here and not telling my family) and because we don’t see ourselves in the public perception of what “an addict” looks like. 

Right now my life is saveable but if I lost my job and family, there’ll be no reason for me to get sober. So I hope someone who’s going down a same path makes the decision now before it gets worse.

That “post-overdose window” is the most dangerous part of the entire crisis, and right now there is zero medical tool designed for it.

Clinics can start someone on Suboxone, but only after withdrawal begins. With fentanyl, that can take 24–72 hours. If you start too soon, you trigger violent precipitated withdrawal. It’s not a failure of Suboxone — it’s a timing problem the system has never solved.

And this is where people die. They walk out of the ER or away from EMS, use again to feel normal, and overdose a second time. It’s the deadliest 48-hour period in modern public health.

What’s missing is a bridge between Narcan and treatment.

We need a field-ready, fentanyl-safe buprenorphine induction device that lets EMS, clinics, or outreach teams slowly microdose buprenorphine in a way that doesn’t trigger precipitated withdrawal. The science already exists. The delivery technology already exists. This is not futuristic. It’s just unbuilt.

The only reason it doesn’t exist is the same reason Narcan almost didn’t:
there’s no immediate profit in building it. Once the public demanded Narcan as a necessity, companies found a way to make it. The same could be true here.

This device would stabilize people right after overdose — the exact moment they are most likely to die — and give them a safe path into actual treatment.

We talk a lot about the opioid crisis, but nobody is talking about this missing tool.
If we’re serious about saving lives in the fentanyl era, this has to be part of the conversation.

Im 90 days clean now and today was the first day in my New job. Im slowly picking up the pieces of my life again and gluing them together. Still a lot to do and a lot to repair!

I feel amazing. Almost every day now. Even my cold hands and feet got better. I have energy. I dont need to force myself to do stuff I can do stuff and get proud and motivated that I did it.
I still smoke a little bit of weed but I had a 2 weeks break of that so its under more control now than in the beginning and I will soon try to stop completely but for now I dont want to change a running System and i reduced it to 1-2 joints a day at the end of the day.
I still take Supplements but only omega 3, zink and some Vitamines. My motivation System is still a bit fuqed though like things can be fun but after a few hours of concentration I get really burned out but that gets better too i bet!

No cravings. And I dont want to go back to opioids EVER. I love my New life. I love being clean of them. 
Thank you guys!",9

I’m dying, I’m dying. I need heroin now. I pull up my pants and tighten my shoestring belt around my no longer recognizable waist. I just got done defecating in the bushes across from Motel 6. I just got kicked out of trying to bribe them for another night. I demand you give me a free room as I enter the lobby with a bed bug in a cigarette plastic. Plus, it was still alive. Look at these bites as I take my shirt off in front of them. Scores of them all down my side. Look! “The manager says sir we found needles in your room after we switched you the night before and gave you a free room.” “So what I’m a fucking diabetic, I’m going to sue your asses” the dude scoffs and says “your insulin is heroin? There was blood in the needle not to mention the cigarette butt cottons”. 

Fuck fuck, I stormed out the door and grabbed my 3 trash bags of my clothes and everything I owned. Frail and dopesick I carry them across the street. My bowels were turning into whatever the fuck that volcano’s name is in Hawaii, where I first started using needles. I throw my bags in some bushes next to a carmax. Relieve myself. I look around and see some cardboard where a fellow heroin consumer musta have slept with ants and old clothes. I fall upon my sweet sweet heroin King mattress. I’m really sick. I’m dying I kept repeating “fuck” was used probably 600 times that day.

I text my buddy who is down a mile at a different motel for a get-well shoot. No reply. OF course, not its 11 am junkies don’t wake up, and if we do, we are usually too busy trying to find a vein.  I grab my 3 bags of my world and huck 2 over my shoulder and one under my arm and start walking. Having to stop every 5 steps to adjust my too-big of thrift store Levi’s. I was a snail that was dopesick, leaving a trail of snot behind with each sacred limp to my drug buddy’s shit motel. Cars are buzzing by honking. Yelling words I didn’t care to be called. As long as I got my dope. Fuck this left my bags halfway in a bush behind a Del Taco and ran. Checked my phone and he said room 191.

It’s 12:30 pm now. It’s 90 degrees. I’m 104 pounds and wearing a hoodie. Colder than hell, I pound on his door like a SWAT team. No answer…. mother fucker. Louder knocks…he texts come back in 30 I’ll have a shot ready my dealer is in here he doesn’t like you. Fucking flaco. 2 hours later I’m shivering behind a dumpster. He texts “cruise up”. Thank fuck. I run like junkie Gump. Bang bang, he opens. “Wtf man” I moan smacking my arm. He is loaded and passed out. “Nodded out lol, here” he handed me a pre-loaded rig. “You gotta go he’s coming back.” Fuck fuck fuck…. I run down stairs

I ran back to Del Taco where my bags were at and used a token for the bathroom and had to order a 39c taco. I roll my sweater up and had no veins. Fuck. I was dehydrated. Did push-ups. Nothing. fuck. Okay, let’s go poking. Finally, I managed to find a vein, and I missed half the shot. Fuck it, snot dried up stomach cramps gone. Eyes dried up. It’s 4 pm I can now start hustling for 20 bucks for my next shot. I leave the Del Taco semi-high, grab my bags, and start walking to a Walmart…..and so it goes ….

117,1nc5elj,About to hit 1 month clean from 400-600mg of oxy a day (cold turkey),[deleted],30,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1nc5elj/about_to_hit_1_month_clean_from_400600mg_of_oxy_a/,"About to be 1 month clean from roughly 400-600mgs of oxycodone a day. I was desperate to quit for months as it was destroying my relationship and my work and was no longer fun to use, it was just a weekly tax that stopped me from being sick. I was spending roughly $7000 a month on longtecs and basically stopped me working (self employed) and caring about about anything.

I went completely cold turkey and it was excruciating. I was twitching, sick, not sleeping for the first 5 days. I then bought a few blisters of xanax and managed to knock myself out for a few days. I've been addicted to valium for 10 years but don't ever up my dose. However the xanax gave me painful withdrawals.

I've been through H withdrawal before (smoking it for 4 months) but a year of oxy was 10x worse. However nowhere near as bad as benzo withdrawal which I wouldn't wish on anyone.

2 weeks after stopping was surprised to start getting my energy back and a bit of sleep. I have very little opiate cravings at all. However now close to a month and don't have my appetite back - I've actually lost a lot of weight since stopping.

I've now finally been able to travel again, I was trapped for a year due to the addiction. The best cure imo is leaving all your triggers behind and moving elsewhere. I wiped my phone and cut ties even with close friends which I feel incredibly bad about but will have to explain once I'm sober longer.

I still struggle with alcohol and coke but nothing beats not having to wake up everyday wondering how to score oxy and feel sick of the disgusting amount of money you spend on them.

I work freelance and made some terrible decisions while on oxy, and have come out sober but also minus 500k to almost zero and pretty much rebuilding my financial life / family life again.

There is always hope, I was afraid to ask for help but worked through it with my partner for 2 weeks while sick.

I've been through suboxone detox before but nothing beats the feeling of achievement of stopping cold turkey and dealing with it on your own.

I was searching this sub before I decided to detox, looking for hope so thought I'd leave a note here.

It keeps pulling me back man, like I have been on a rocky year quitting percs to subs to norco to this bullshit tobacco shop shit that really cost me.

Me and P were super close, we were together pretty much every single day for 6 years, half of high school and all of my college, lived together for a year. After that, i had 2 kids immediately after graduating from college, so i didnt really see him anymore.

P is the child of 2 alcoholic parents, and he got started drinking and smoking really young.  In the years since, hes had about every bad thing happen to him that can happen to someone with a poly drug addiction. His life would fall apart, hed go to rehab, get a job and car and apartment. Then hed go back out, crash the car, lose the job and end up homeless. Like 20 times of that cycle. You guys know how it goes. So the last time he ended up in the hospital with sepsis and multiple infections, mrsa, wounds, the works. He wasnt expected to survive. His mom didnt bother coming around. His dad came by and told him 'looks like youre not going to make it so im going to turn in the plates on your car.' P said ok. Nothing else to say i guess.  Idk why, but that hit me hard. 

So hes made it over 2 years sober now. Hes a carpenter now, works for a builder and hes a foreman. He and his mom bought a townhouse together. Last time i talked to him when right when he got out of the hospital. Hadnt seen him in probably 7 or 8 years.

Hes just such a great person, kind of a space cadet, so funny and under it all just a really caring sweet fun guy. Im just so thankful to see him doing good. I was thinking about it this morning and came to tears, thinking about how his addiction has caused him to suffer all these years. 

I was really thankful to see him. It was so nice to sit down and talk recovery and life with him and our other friend, who doesnt have any addictions, but is as caring and understanding as a 'normie' can be. I dont know why im sharing all this, but i just felt like i needed to. As long as we're alive we still have a shot to recover.",3

And I know this is dumb but as my withdrawal was so fast I really thought it was going to be an easy thing to do and recover from. The devil on my shoulder taking I know.

Something happened today to make me extremely angry. I work full time and Im not on a bad wage but my god living expenses are so high I feel like I'm in poverty. I lost it for a while.

I can't speak about recovery but it was a total waste of time and money. I literally got zero out of it. No good feeling, nothing at all. I feel guilty for caving but it really showed me how little this drug was doing for me. I got absolutely nothing from it and I don't think I'll be going back any time soon. It was such a build up and such a let down.

I’ve had a few tokes of fentanyl but that’s all, i even have a bit of a tolerance I felt like but never think that when it comes to fentanyl, never that you can do more than usual. I’ve lost 13 friends and I’ve flatlined at least 10 times, overdosed and revived at least 35 times. Maybe more and surprisingly im not retarded. I use to see an ambulance reviving someone and I would ask the other users standing around what colour he had used and who had it, then going to get that stuff myself. Anything that had carfentanil was always sought after. So ya ask your Dr about Sublicade today! (Side effects may include release from physical dependency of opiates) 

If anyone actually reads this and takes the same actions make sure to come back and let me know.

128,1leyt9r,Someone asked in a previous post if their 30s is too late to get sober...so i wanted to share this with him and you guys as well.,Due-Violinist5278,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1leyt9r/someone_asked_in_a_previous_post_if_their_30s_is/,"u/IR30Lover this is my response and I really hope it helps you brother.

I noticed yoir concern in the comments was about ""accomplishments."" I dont blame you for asking. But accomplishments mean two very different things to me now in sobriety as opposed to being in my addiction. Materials? Career milestones? Financial gain? These are all idolized in the world I was in when I was addicted. They were also all that mattered to the people around me. They determined self-esteem and my personal worth. Ironically, I was an utter, complete piece of dog shit and seemed to have no real grasp of myself.

My brain was running on opiates for 20 yrs. From age 17 to age 37. By 37 I had lost my business. Lost my children. Lost my license. Lost my car. Filed for bankruptcy. I was a convicted felon never to be able to get a job at a McDonald’s, let alone something serious for my age. All relationships were gone. I had stolen from everyone. I had almost died from endocarditis from using IV drugs. My fiancée had died. My little sister had died from fentanyl after I had introduced her to opiates. My mother had turned into a miserable drunk in response.

I had literally no one. I had grown up in a wealthy area in North Florida. All of my friends were Drs and lawyers. I myself was kicked out of law school due to pawning something that turned out to be stolen. And here I was, 37. Unhireable. Not a single human to answer my phone call. Homeless, nowhere to sleep. And btw, I was high at work. Stepped off the ladder the wrong way and was now literally disabled. Completely blew out my ankle. Didn’t get the proper treatment and was now handicapped. I needed crutches to walk. So I’m a crippled homeless man withdrawing from dope and also dying of hepatitis C. I catch a ride to an AA meeting and a girl who knew me from years prior of trying to get clean gave me a hug. I broke down in tears and I asked her to help. That night she connected me with somebody at a sober living place.

If it hasn’t gotten this bad for you yet? Consider yourself lucky.

When I came into AA for the 4th or 5th time, I knew the drill. I knew if I did what a sponsor told me, I would get better. I put my ego aside. I had read enough business books and positive thinking literature to understand the value of a mentor and how his successful patterns would be kinetic. Life is a sum of patterns, habits, right? I’d adopt new ones.

A.A. was culty. I hated the religious aspect of it (or so I thought). And the first step is believing in a power greater than myself. It’s establishing a baseline. A psychological rest stop, a father to hand our problems and our faith over to. Because the hole we dug was high and our shovel was broken. I am so grateful I had had some time during incarceration where I had been connected to something higher than myself. I knew there was something buzzing out there that was real. Reading the Big Book and being able to actually feel something inside as I read certain sections of the book.

I had a ""spiritual experience"" in my past so I knew this is what came with the steps and the process. The thing that helped me this time around was viewing the AA meeting house like a battery. God existed to me at a specific higher frequency. In order to be in tune to His station, I have to maintain a vibration. In my addiction, my vibration was low. Thinking was low. Self-image, mood, aspirations— all of it was low.

So to be in tune with God, I had to plug in and charge up. When I physically could not be there, I had to maintain this vibration with actions, communication, and reading. So an AA meeting would charge me up. Reading the Big Book. Talking to other addicts or alcoholics. And most importantly, calling my sponsor. I had to call him every single day. If I wanted to adopt his life (a happy man with a wife and kids who admired him), then I would need to copy his behaviors.

So I would run my sick and unhealthy thinking through his processor every a.m. And man, for a guy who lost his father at 8 yrs old to drunk driving, having a man I could call for the first time in my life every single day— who would listen to every single one of my problems, bad ideas, and plans— and then he would say, “OK, this is how you should handle this”? That was something I had been missing my entire life that I didn’t realize I needed. It brought a lot of peace and confidence my way.

To make a long story short, I now operate in a different realm. One where “success” is measured by my relationships with other human beings, by love in my heart, and by peace and happiness. Almost 3 yrs later, there is a calm I feel now. It’s unlike anything I ever experienced, even before my addiction. I bootcamped sobriety pretty damn hard my first year. Several meetings a day. And while it’s the toughest and hardest part of getting clean, there is almost something I miss about it— the grind. The struggle. The fire under my ass.

I ended up getting reconstructive surgery on my leg. I started going to the gym for the first time in my life and getting into good shape. I can walk again. No more hepatitis C and a doomed liver. I have my own place. My kids live with me full-time. I have custody back. I’ve built a business that has just blessed me beyond anything I can imagine. I literally built it on crutches with a cellphone in my hand while being broke, newly sober, and sleeping on my grandmother’s couch. And now me and my kids travel all over. We can do whatever we want whenever we want. And the most important thing is we do it all together.

Am I successful? Yes, I’m happy. I’m at peace. People can depend on me. Every morning I wake up, it’s a blessing. It’s a gift that I am excited about taking on. And if you’re asking whether or not you will have this? If it’s too late for you? I’ll tell you no, it’s not too late. And what God has in store for you? You are unable to conceive with your wildest imagination. In 2016, I sat on my bunk bed in a correctional facility reading a page in the Big Book, where it made me a promise to me. When I read it, I got goosebumps. I will never ever forget that moment. Because the promise was big and it was appealing to me. It was what I wanted. And I can tell you, my friend— it came true. I’ll share it with you:

"" Established on such a footing we became less and less interested in ourselves, our little plans and designs. More and more we became interested in seeing what we could contribute to life. As we felt new power flow in, as we enjoyed peace of mind, as we discovered we could face life successfully, as we became conscious of His presence, we began to lose our fear of today, tomorrow or the hereafter. We were reborn.""

129,1jlv4zv,Methadone Stigma,[deleted],28,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1jlv4zv/methadone_stigma/,"I'm just posting this to say that if you've spent years fighting opiate addiction ON and OFF, and feel like there's no way out, and are like I was, completely disregarding maintenence, specifically Methadone or have tried Suboxone and still couldn't stop thinking about Opiates, you really should at least consider methadone. 

I tapered as low as I could stand off Fent, made it to almost nothing, literally grains a day, so small you couldn't even see it, and I still couldn't function so after a few people suggested methadone I finally said fuck it and went to the clinic. I know people who are still on it and some who used it to maintain and regain stability while tapering, but the one thing I feel is important to stress is that IT WORKS.

Stop feeling guilty or like your giving up on sobriety for considering it. If you're on the right dose all it's gonna do is take away cravings, make you feel normal with a bit of pain relief if you have chronic pain outside of withdrawl, and most importantly, keep you from caring about getting high anymore. Your receptors will be satisfied and you'll resume life as a normal, contributing person, capable of going to school, working, forming relationships, etc.

The trick is to be honest with yourself, you'll know if your taking too high or too low of a dose. In the beginning it's crucial to play around with the dose to see what's too low and what's too high. It took me about 2 weeks of starting at 20mgs and going as low as 4mgs for 3 days, 5mgs for another 3, and eventually doubling my take home for 5mgs to realize that 10mgs is my sweet spot.

I just went back to work and didn't miss a beat, and my job is moderately physical and a quick pace is crucial. I'm finishing my GED (last test) in 2 weeks and I was able to keep about 6/10s of my savings that I kept stacking up while on fentynal the past 3 years while planning my escape from fentynal, to use the $ for Tech schhol. 

Truthfully, I don't even hate fentynal  or any opiate. After all these years I finally realize, it was never their fault for the way i am, and it might not even be mine. Without opiates I probably would have killed myself tbh. I wasn't functional day to day, and today I can honestly say methadone makes my life more normal than it's ever been. 

I look forward to each day and don't gamble with my life anymore. Stop being so prideful about sobriety, is my advice. We have no issue with tossing pride and dignity out the window and selling it for a bag when we do fentynal. We said we'd never fo fentynal, remember? We said we'd never do Heroin.. we said we'd never smoke a perc.. said we'd never steal for a habit. Said we'd never be homeless, etc. You get the picture..

""FUCK PRIDE..it ONLY hurts, it NEVER helps"" 

At the very least, try it for a few days and plan a taper. Anything is better than fentynal. Sure heroin is coming back, at least in the NE, but it won't last, and it will be laced with fent still. And goof luck ever affording an oxy habit. Go to the clinic for free, or at a small copay. Even people without insurance pay less for the clinic than they do they're dope habit. 

We're junkies, stop acting like your above maintenence, it's not just about US, we effect the people we love, most of them already consider us dead so that it doesn't hit so hard if we do, and so they can still be excited when they do see us ""oh wow he's not dead yet!"" If you can't do it for yourself, at least do it so your loved ones aren't trapped anymore, it's not fair to them.

Anyway, Just my 3 cents ",29

The comfort of having my drugs and no worries because I made it home safe, didn't get robbed or arrested, and didn't have to go back out there for awhile.

Then around day 4 or 5, the stress and anxiety would start to hit.  All the worrying about where I was getting the money, how much I was spending, all the debt I was in, the places and people I would have to rob next because I NEEDED IT TO SURVIVE.  Hitting up the various plugs, venturing out to P-Town where I had absolutely no business being. I've been shot at, stabbed, done the stabbing, gotten beat up, beat other people up.  Got cheated and hustled and felt truly shocked.  ""How could anyone do this to me"" I always asked myself, obviously forgetting about all the horrible things I would do to secure the drugs. 

I justified it all. I wore a suit and tie everyday to work. A mortgage, car loans, bills.  A wife and kids who I had to support. Mouths to feed. ""Normal"" friends. Absolutely no one would look at me and think JUNKIE.  But I was a junkie of the highest degree.  The biggest scumbag.  A wolf in sheep's clothing. I hid it so well.  Never got caught, never OD'd, my wife and family didn't suspect a thing. I was living a lie, but which life was the lie and which was real? I didn't even know anymore.  Survival mode for years. Locked in and focused on making money, legally and illegally, so I could support the use. 

Trying over and over and over to get clean without admitting to anyone how badly I fucked up.  How could I ever admit something like that? Someone like me being a heroin addict? No fucking way.  I could never take the embarrassment and shame of it all.  What would my wife think? What would my family and friends think of me. They would see the absolute loser I really was and I was never going to let that happen.  Not while I was living anyway.  

I would build up the courage to quit. Brace for the shock of cold turkey withdrawal. Still had to wake up with the kids and get them ready for school.  Still had to go to work.  Still had to coach, go on camping outings and be the perfect husband and father I so foolishly duped myself into believing I was. Throwing up constantly, shitting my ass out, sweating, the body aches and pains, the feeling of NEVER GETTING COMFORTABLE.  The sleepless nights laying next to my wife in bed while she was sleeping. Through sheer white knuckle willpower I tried not to toss and turn... waiting for her to finally go to sleep so I could retreat downstairs and suffer through the night alone. Every night feeling like hours. The dread of dawn coming when the kids would wake up and I would have to face life without drugs.  

This wasn't sustainable.  I would make it 3 or 4 days.. a week tops. I couldn't take more than that.  Behind on work, wife getting concerned that I wasn't getting better from my ""stomach flu"", I had to pick up.  I promised myself a taper, use benzos, use cocaine to come off Heroin.  I tried everything.  Being sober never could actually stick.  How could it?  I was living in my own personal hell.  No one to talk to about it.  Alone in the pit of despair that was my conscious. I cannot describe how it felt. Thoughts of ending myself came often. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy. 

What a fuckin joke it all was. All for what?  So I could be numb for a few fleeting moments.  It didn't even feel good anymore.

This is already longer than it should be so I'll fast forward. After a couple years of the above cycle, I finally got arrested.  I ran out to get pizza for the family and didn't come back.  After hours and hours and hours the police finally let me make a phone call.  I called my wife to come bail be out of jail.  She was worried sick about me.  She thought I died.  I wasn't picking up my phone obviously, the police had it. Like the perfect wife she is, she didn't ask questions. She came straight to the jail and bailed me out.  

The jig was up. I broke down and told her everything. I'll spare you the details but to say she was pissed would be putting it mildly. Rightfully so. 

I was on the brink of losing my wife and kids.  I now had felony charges.  I was facing losing my professional license and my career of 18 years. My employer fired me.  Even with all this, I felt better than I did in years.  I finally could talk to someone about my addiction. The secrets were over! Something I never though was possible.  After opening up to my wife, I told my siblings, my parents, my in laws.  Everyone who was close to me.  And god damn I was never called a loser junkie.  All the fear I had was bullshit.

Finally, after being open and honest and with the support of my friends and family, I got clean.  It still wasn't easy, but holy shit was it easier than keeping all those secrets.  I could actually open up and talk about all these feelings that were creeping back.  I joined one of the fellowships. Holy shit there are other people out there who are just like me?  And they made it out the other side?  I couldn't believe it. I wasn't unique and I wasn't alone.  

6 years later and my life is back. My wife and I made it out the other side, we have a better relationship now then we ever had.  My kids are growing up, almost done with High School.  I can be there for them. Really be there without the fog and distraction of an opiate addiction.  My finances are back on track. I started over. I got a second chance.  I was able to hold my professional license and career because I was honest with the regulators about my addiction, it is a disease after all and I was getting treatment. I have a new better job now. 

That's pretty much my story.  If you made it this far your a champ.  I know I'm not some eloquent writer. I just want to say if you're out there struggling like I was then TELL ON YOURSELF.  There are people out there who who will love and support you.  Society loves a comeback story and is very forgiving for the addict who is trying their hardest to come back. 

DO NOT DO THIS ALONE. Find support, talk to people, be open and honest about your feelings. If you want it then fucking get it.  Do it like your life depends on it, because it does. You are worth it. Legends are born in the valley of struggle. Become a legend.

The truth? Recovery feels like crawling naked through glass most days. You shake, you cry, you rage at yourself, you beg the universe to make it easier. And still you wake up again.
I don’t call myself healed. I call myself still here. That’s the only badge I wear.
If you’re tapering, if you’re cold turkey, if you’re on day 1 or day 1,000 your survival is the proof. You don’t have to be perfect, just present. You don’t have to glow, just breathe.
And if you feel like you’re alone, you’re not. Some of us built rooms out of our scars, places where you can bleed words instead of relapse. We call it UndergroundGods, but really it’s just people who get it.

136,1lrs0ph,Kratom helps with withdrawals… Psilocybin helps with staying clean why is no one mentioning this ?,Decent-Fun190,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1lrs0ph/kratom_helps_with_withdrawals_psilocybin_helps/,"Alright, I’ve been sharing a lot about kratom as a tool to get off opioids. Some people react positively, others are strongly against it and I get both sides. What I’ve noticed though, is that many people basically just swap their opioid of choice for kratom and assume that’s enough.

In my opinion, if you use kratom to get through opioid withdrawal, you should also plan to taper off it as soon as possible.

From my own experience, that’s when the real mental battle begins — the cravings, depression, endless thought loops… Psilocybin (mushrooms) helped me break those patterns and gave me a true mental reset.

And yet, hardly anyone talks about psilocybin in the context of addiction recovery. People struggle for years with methadone, Suboxone, even kratom — I see it all over Reddit — but rarely do I see people mentioning psilocybin as part of their recovery process. It’s not a magic pill, but honestly, it’s the closest thing to magic I’ve ever experienced.

To be clear: psilocybin won’t stop your physical withdrawals — but once you get through that phase, it can make a huge difference mentally. It’s non-addictive, not harmful to the body, yet rarely discussed when it comes to life after opioids.

For those interested: scientific research on psilocybin is already showing promising results in treating alcohol addiction, tobacco dependence, and even cocaine/crack use. The potential for mental health and addiction recovery is massive, but it’s still flying under the radar in most opioid recovery discussions.

Just thought I’d share that, hopefully it helps someone.",75

Now, I am in school for Social Services, specializing in addiction, my relationships with my family and friend have been repaired, and I am learning to love myself again.

I’m so sick of living like this. I made a year clean up until a year ago, when I started chipping oxies again. That debt I paid off started to pile back up, and my use got higher and higher. 

By Christmas I was in full dependency, taking 90-150mg of pharma oxy per day. It was a Herculean effort to make my pills last through the holidays, but I did it. Unfortunately when I got back and got paid, I ramped right back up. 

I’ve half-asses tried to taper my oxy, but I always find a reason to take just one more, just one more, ok maybe another half… you know the drill. 

I’m petrified of being on subs long term. I’m very scared of experiencing acute withdrawals for a month. 

My goal is to only use the subs for about a week, using less and less each time to hopefully give myself a relatively soft landing into sobriety. Has anybody found success in this method?

I’d appreciate any feedback on my plan, or your experience using subs either long term or more in a rapid taper like I plan.

It’s been years since I have engaged with any online communities dedicated to opioid use. Back when I started using, 2012-ish, I was very into tumblr and I used to browse Jinxie’s Natural Habitat and I was very active on Reddit. I just remembered that blog, and it made me think to check up on the Reddit communities and see what’s going on. All these years later, it’s weird to think about and hard to even imagine that was me. 

Anyway, I’ve been completely clean from heroin/fentanyl for 5 years in November. My life is pretty normal now.  I remember my days of posting on Reddit looking for help with withdrawal, trying to manage the balancing act that is life with a heroin addiction. Eventually the heroin wasn’t heroin anymore and the game completely changed. Sometimes I credit my recovery to that fact alone, because fentanyl was nothing like the stuff I first started using. 

I just want to let you know that if you’re going through it right now, in any capacity, you’re going to be okay. Withdrawal sucks, but it’s nothing compared to a life of dependency. Just get through withdrawal and move forward, one day it will be a distant memory. We all end up dependent on one thing or another, let it be the pleasures of living a normal life.

Tldr: methadone is actually pretty great, if you're truly ready to fight your way off opiates. Happy to answer any and all questions. Heck, I'll give my opinion on your situation and a recommended road map if you want. 

I'm prescribed 300mg gabapentin for restless legs and it's been very helpful for this whole process. 

A bit of history. I'd say I spent 7 years on and off hooked on fentanyl. Started around 2017. I was sober most of 2020 with the exception of a pill I had mailed to me (stupid). Had a few months sober here and there. 

35m and I'm a bit of a mixed bag. Sharp, educated, but from a redneck alcoholic family. Dad owned a bar, so had money and nice stuff, but everyone I knew was always drunk. 4.0 in high school, but grew mushrooms at 17. Yada yada yada.

First opiates were codeine and morphine pills a friend stole from neighbors he was house sitting for. Apparently their medicine cabinets were loaded with expired pill bottles like you wouldn't believe. There were 6 of us - 3 guys and 3 girls - and 2 big zip locks full of misc stolen pills. Tramadol, codeine, morphine, seroquel, ritalin, ativan, and I don't remember what else. I do (kinda) remember 2 weeks straight of skittle parties every day after school. 

Then I didn't touch opiates for nearly a decade. Hurt my back at 25, got morphine from a neighbor, jumped to blues a couple years later, and you all know how that goes. 

Ended up ruining a 4 year relationship, lost the woman I intended to marry, spiraled for a bit. Fought it, fell back, fought it, yada yada, almost killed myself more than once. The war stories I could tell. 

So how'd I get off...? 

----------------------------------------

----------------------------------------hammer time

Was at 4-5 blues a day at my worst, mix of smoked for the rush and snorted for longevity. More often though I was doing 2-3 a day. March last year I tried to taper myself off fent, took a week off work, got down to a quarter pill a day but couldn't get off, was back to 1-2 a day by start of April. 

By May I became desperate. I had never wanted off this badly. It was like something shifted mentally. I was willing to do anything. I literally thought about just stabbing my dealer. I cut my debit card in half to make it harder to get cash. Didn't really help. 

I had always avoided methadone because of horror stories from a friend who was on it 3 years and struggled to get off, then just relapsed. I was desperate though. 

Started methadone mid May 2024. First tapered off Xanax I'd been casually abusing, then last fent dose was June 2nd. 

I was scared, and had LOTS of experience trying to taper myself off fent (once successfully in 2021), so convinced the doctor (nurse wasn't having it, tried to fight me) to let me start tapering methadone immediately. 

Started at 65mg methadone, dropped 5mg per week a few weeks, then 3mg per week starting around 35mg. I took several breaks where I was stressed or just needed time for my body to adjust. Stayed at 12mg from mid October through the new year because the holidays led to several relapses in the past. 

How'd it feel? Not fun, but not terrible. I didn't have to take time off work, though I was a dick to my boss more than a couple times. Slept decent most nights. Physical withdrawals weren't that bad, but emotionally I was a wreck. 

Mood swings. Nothing was fun. It was basically 11 months of rarely having a good time and hating life, but having dealt with chronic depression and anxiety all my life, it was nothing I hadn't felt before. Just stubbornly persistent. 

I basically withdrew from the world. I have 800 hours on Cyberpunk 2077, I've read about 20k pages (mostly wheel of time), and I've watched Lord of the Rings extended edition I don't know how many times over the last year. 

Got down to 2mg. Took my last dose 2 weeks ago today. First few days I slept like shit, but otherwise felt surprisingly OK. Like tired, moody, occasional hot flashes, but better than expected. 

Today I feel mostly great. Sleep is meh, but could be worse. I'm on top of laundry, mowed my lawn and worked on my garden today, in a pretty good mood. I wish I had done this all sooner. Life is beautiful. ",12

But I like to celebrate the fentanyl recovery. It’s a big deal to me. Fentanyl consumed my every thought action and emotion for over 3 years. I was a complete slave to it and just constantly obsessed with using it and getting more. Even for the first year after I quit my cravings haunted me like a goddamn monster and my body still hurt and I was so tired and miserable. I relapsed a lot. The pain is so hard to deal with. 


But I wanna say this to anyone who needs to hear it. I haven’t touched fentanyl in over five years. I go months at a time now without even thinking of it. I very rarely feel even a mild craving for it or any opiate. In the last year I’ve consistently reported feeling absolutely zero physical pain to my doctor at my monthly check ups. 

I used fentanyl all day every day for 3 years and I felt so fucking hopeless. It ruled my life. My brain. My soul. I was so certain and so scared that even if I managed to stay clean, the overwhelming obsession and desire would never leave me alone. 


I go months now without even thinking about it. And I know you can too.

Opiates destroyed my adulthood.,Historical-Love-4097,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1odpqce/alcohol_destroyed_my_childhood_opiates_destroyed/,"Something that clicked this time around getting clean was why I got high in the first place.

My brother and I grew up in a single mother home, she divorced my father when I was about 9 and he was about 13. We had lived in an apartment that was supposed to be temporary until the whole family moved to a house in CT. We would look as a family and then one day our mother woke us up to go say bye to our father. It was sometime in the Fall.

After that, shit went downhill fast. My brother started sneaking off to smoke weed with his freinds, drink even tried coke around that age and pretty much whatever else he could.

 We were told out father was a ""functioning alcoholic"" and he was for sure, but he was a pretty easygoing drunk. He didnt hit us, he didnt verbally abuse us, pretty much the opposite tbh. He was excitable and fun to be around. Sometimes it sucked cause after the divorce he was pretty depressed and seeing my father cry, at my age, as a boy learning to be a man, it was kinda crazy to see. Im not judging, but here I am a kid, and I feel like I gotta lift this guy up thats supposed to be doing that for me. Still though, in comparison to what it was like living with our mother, it was kind of a blessing. 

Our mother was, according to herself, a ""weekend warrior"" she'd go out everyday from Thursday to Saturday and get hammered. Thing is though, she was also a bartender Monday Through Thursday. She grew up in alcoholic home herself and all 3 of her brother died from drinking. 

No one could put fear into me like her. The only time ive ever experienced that type of fear is when I was in jail for 2 months and for 2 weeks I had a gang member trying to reform in my cell. The worst wasnt even getting the belt or beat, even though that sucked since I basically just had to sit there and take it knowing I could easily do something about it. The worst was the shit she would say and threaten. 

She'd tell us stuff like us being alive ruined her life, she didn't want us, our father tricked her into believing he was impotent. She even threatened to kill us or kill herself several times. Me and brother would just be hanging out and if she came out of the room past 10AM in the robe we knew to go into the basement and chill or leave the house, but even then she'd yell shit, or talk shit about us loud enough for us to hear. She'd throw fits randomly then go to her room and cry asking why? Over and over, and it made me feel pity for her even though it was literally about her not wanting us lol. ""Your father doesnt want you either"" 

It was pretty insane, at that same time I was expected to to well, I excelled academically and my brother not so much. We were pitted against each other constantly by her and him being bigger then me, I end up with alot of stiches. She didnt come home until around 6 or 7 and sometimes not at all. When my brother went to my dad's to live for a while, I was all alone with this insanity. Thats when it really got confusing because i had no one around to confirm how crazy she was being, so alot of the time, no matter how right I knew I was, id end up blaming myself anyway. 

She would say crazy shit, then just go blank trying to bait you, then just look at you and be like ""what?! Get a life, stop acting like a little girl"" or some wild shit like this. 

This whole period of my life and my brothers definitely fucked us up pretty significantly. I cant speak for him, but for me, now that im sober from opiates I realize so much of why I did them in the first place.

Its because no matter where I go in the world, I have this hypervigalence about everything. It kinda lied beneath the surface of however im really feeling. I overthink what im gonna say, and wonder if I even said enough, or could have worded things better. I overanyalze body language and eye contact. I want love but get afraid ill fuck it up and have trouble with silence even if its completely natural. Even when im feeling confident or self assured I constantly question it or try to reaffirm if its geniune or wonder if im being arrogant. 

This shit always surfaces when im sober, and truthfully its probably always there, but when I was on opiates I felt safer. I wasnt obviously, I was literally putting myself in more danger, but I know now why I did it and how I justified it.

It really got bad once I was homeless, it was bad when my father died and 2 months later my mother kicked me out of the house after a fight with her BF at the time and she told me ""i told you if you made me choose between him and you it would be him"" and keep in mind i was sober when this happened. She would let this guy push me around and punch me and told me if I hit him back she'd call the cops and say I hit him first.

It was truly insane, I felt trapped in a situation that just kept getting worse and my father dying made it even crazier becsuse I had no one who truly understand the situation and could get me to see reason. I think subconsciously or maybe even consciously I chose to do opiates to not onlt numb myself while being functional job wise during this insane stress, but also to live up to what was being projected onto me. If im such a burden I might as well make it worth it, and if you need someone to blame, fuck it ill be the scapegoat. At least then I can justify the amount of shit get shoveled down my throat. ""Yea she's hard on me, but i deserve it"" 

I never really got addicted to alcohol and it caused more destruction in my life then any other drug ive done. There's people in NA meeting who will roll their eyes when you bring up this kind of stuff, in my experience its usually old timers, and my best guess would be that it hits home for them. They've probably heard it from their kids and cant stand that its true. I get it, but thats doesnt make it less valid. And personally, in order for me to move past it, I have to admit it and accept it. Really understand where all this pain started. 

And trust me I get it, like I said, my mother grew up in an alcoholic home, as did my father. My father's parents werent abusive though, just slightly neglectful. My mother didnt have that same situation. They could easily say the same thing though, but it wouldnt be false. I used to think ""well we could just go back generationally and blame every generation so whats the point"" but im not looking to subvert blame, just to understand, for me, so i can heal from it and move on. I cant just pretend its all normal and all good. That shit shaped who I am today in the worst way. 

I hope anyone else battling addictions can find the strength to understand the root of their compulsions for control too. Because ultimately thats all addiction is. An urge to control emotions, attached to memories, situations or people that cant be changed, only understood and made peace with. Id argue though that most of us had no idea how to process and handle those emotions or even thought it was possible to when our addictive behaviors began. 

I know when I got serious this time, I told myself, im ready to feel all the pain, no more hiding from it. Let it all flow and in time it will get easier, and so far thats whats been happening. Snapshots of moments I suppressed all my life, probably in an effort to create a memory where that pain was somehow in my control or didnt exist at all. But the thing about life is, all of your life is yours. The good and the bad, doesnt make it your fault or and doesnt mean you need to depend on anyone for the good, it just means you gotta accept it for what it is, cuz like my dad used to say religiously: ""I know you hate to hear this buddy, but It Is What It Is""

I got to work that day without doing any heroin for 8 hours already, feeling like absolute shit. Yawing, sweating, anxiety, and nausea started to set in quick. Did I mention this is my stepdads, dad’s business. So it’s not like I can just go home cause I lived with him and my mom at the time. They both worked there too. I was like 19 at the time. 

    It was a Friday and that was payday so I figured I could bullshit half the day till my hour lunch break, take a drive downtown to my guy and come back. WRONG! We had a $40,000 delivery job to take that required the box truck and not just a pickup truck like normal. Guess who was the only one of the 3 of us who could drive it, ME! :) Also had to load up all the windows and 1x4, 1x6, and 1x12, probably like 20 single windows, 8 doubles, and 2 triples. 

   When I tell you that was the longest drive of my life (1 hour), I almost went off the road just from being so inside my head. Thankfully the 2 guys with me were about my age and they already knew what was up. They didn’t really care, they did let me just hand off all the stuff and they take it into the garage of the customers house. We chilled in the A/C for a hour and by then it was time to go back. Since we didn’t take a lunch, we could sometimes leave work a hour early. So soon as I got back, I gave them the keys and paperwork to turn in and I left at 3:00(closes at 4). Went and got some and got sold some bullshit so had to wait another 2 days till my other guy had some. 😩

   Big boss man wasn’t happy, ended up getting fired and it really sucked. My mom came home pissed and looking back, I don’t blame her. I ended up progressing to fentanyl after for a little while until I OD’d for the first time and then a second time all in 1 week. This was right when Covid hit and heroin was mixed or non existent. So I ended up saying “I want dogfood(H)” knowing it was all fent, just didn’t care at the time and was depressed. 

 16 months sober and never felt better 👍🏻 Never really crave it anymore cause how much destruction it did to my life and health.

I was so ashamed and worried about the stigma I would face inside the ER, but I was immediately given 16mg of Suboxone which unfortunately put me into precip (it was about 30 hours after last use) after that they admitted me and have been giving me 40mg oxy every 3 hours for the symptoms, Deludid IV as needed, methadone that goes up 20mg a day until I feel comfortable and of course aderax and colonine. I'm still extremely uncomfortable and still feel extremely severe withdrawal, which the oxy and Deludid are not really helping but I'm so so relieved they are trying to keep me comfortable here and being so nice. They have me on 6th floor in a single room with a view of the city. I'll be here until Monday when they are moving me to a inpatient rehab center. 

This is in San Francisco so I'm just glad I can be in a safe place where I can get sober and not use.

I started taking opioids in the beginning of the year, I stopped 6 months in, got clean, relapsed and to try to get rid of the withdrawals by purchasing this weird pill I found at the smoke shop. I took one felt great, and did not have anymore withdrawals, by the time I knew it the bottle was gone and I was back at the smoke shop. I was telling myself I’ll quit tomorrow, this is my last one, but that turned into now…. I’m going everyday, buying at least 2-3 bottles (10 tablets each bottle with 20mg/200 mg in total) 40$ a bottle… since September. I’m deep in, my husband does not know about the issues, nor my addiction.. he’s completely blind sided by it. I feel like a shit wife, and mother. I’m fully functional with it so you can say I’m a functioning addict. I planned on going to the emergency room today so I can finally get off this. I can say, the withdrawal are far WORSE than anything I’ve imagined. I also believe I’ve had medical issues because of it, from RCVS (neurological issues) to vomiting.. my life has completely turned upside down since buying this product. I deeply regret ever touching this… I just wanted to come on here and vent. It’s been hard for me the last couple of months.. no one knows about this secret.. or this habit… I’m living in a shadow, mentally it’s draining and I feel like time is ticking, I’m so into reality that I hate living, I’m addicted to a dopamine high, something in me is missing and I do not know what it is..

I've been addicted for 5 years at this point, and most of the years I used all my savings, until 2 years ago, where I slowly had spent so much of my income that I had to take on loans (BAD loans with a high %) in order to keep working and not get sick.

Fast forward to this day, several of my loans have now gone to the phase where they will take assets from me, I am deeply indebted (which is like 100.000 USD I think, half of which with 20% a year, the other half 5%) and struggle to think positively about this as I am trying to get clean. When I am clean, the burden of this seems so overhwelming that I end up dosing to get away from it, which of course is stupid.

  
But anyway.. I just wanted to hear from other people who maybe found themselves in the same situation as me, how they tackled it or are planning to tackle it.. succes stories too are of course very welcomed.. I think this is one of the main things that makes me want to use again.. but its also one of the reasons I need to stop using 100%. Thank you all, wish you all the best.",29

I’m a 23 y/o female, I’m a wife and a successful small, online business owner. I started oxy and hydro about 8 months ago, when I was working a little part time job and a coworker offered me a perc as I struggle really bad with back pain after a procedure I had done when I was younger. I then started buying them from someone, started doing them only to “feel good” kind of how some people drink alcohol (I don’t drink) then I started using heavier on the daily basis. Not to “feel good” but just to function and not be in WD. My husband also worked out of town and was gone like 5/6 days a week, so I was able to hide my addiction well especially since I have my own income I bought them with. I live in a different state than I was born in, and I don’t have anything to do with my own family as they’re toxic, and I hid my addiction from my in laws. I don’t have many friends, so no one knew or suspected a thing from me as I’ve never struggled with addiction in the past, besides nicotine and caffeine. In the last month, I picked up “blues” which I’m 99% are fent pills. I haven’t tested them, but I just know they’re fent. They’re the same price as regular oxys in my area, and they were a much better “bang for my buck” especially when I got a hot batch (dangerous, I know) but after doing them, oxy or hydro wouldn’t even fase me or get me out of WD. Only blues, so that became my DOC that I used HEAVILY. Well, a few weeks ago my husband came back home as he had an amazing job opportunity in our town, and him being back made it pretty hard to go meet my 🔌 , especially since my 🔌 was absolutely awful to get in touch with and often made me wait HOURS, which always put me in WD especially if I had ran out already. This led to me being “sick” every damn day. I’d wake up multiple times throughout the night withdrawaling, and had to lay in bed some days because I couldn’t move until I got my fix. My husband is ex law enforcement and also a recovered addict who has been sober for 7 years (very proud of him). I am a person who has a few health issues anyway, so he just thought it was my issues causing me to me so sick, although once I came clean about everything, he did say that he suspected it a tiny bit, but did not want to think that because he’s never had a reason to.

I tried to quit cold turkey a few times over the last few weeks, and I ended up in absolute hell, and lapsed every time. Okay, fast forward to Monday evening, 08/9/2025 I attempted to cold turkey yet again, but I was somewhat more hopeful than I had been for the last few attempts. I was in a bad mental state, but so ready to get out because this addiction has taken so much from me that I wanted to grow some lady balls and get through it. My husband cold turkey’d meth, pills, and other things and I remembered his story, so I thought I could do the same…

TW: blood, self harm, pregnancy loss, withdrawal 

I constantly vomited up bile for 18/20 hours, until it turned to just blood. In my withdrawals, vomiting, cold sweating, leg pain/RLS, anxiety, ect were my normal symptoms, but this time it was 100 times worse and I had different symptoms including the mental and full body convulsions, my eyes would roll into the back of my head and I’d hyperventilate. I take buspar for anxiety, have been on it for years, but I wasn’t able to keep anything down so I threw up my medicine although he gave it to me multiple times so I could get it in me. I suspect I was WD’ing from that as well. Then, as time went on I started having more intense psychological, symptoms that I’ve never experienced before. I am a person that struggles with anxiety and depression, but this was some serious dark hell that I went through and I’m wanting to know has anyone else ever experienced this. I only know this because he told me and he took some videos for me to see when I came to. I started to harm myself, I pulled out so much of my hair, banged my head against hard surfaces to try and bust my head open, I attacked my husband when he was giving me a bath and I scratched/bit/fought, I screamed for so many hours until I lost my voice, and at some point on Tuesday, I asked him to take me to the ER. He had wanted to take me all along, but I refused out of shame for what was really happening. I only remember bits and pieces up until this point then it went even blacker. I remember getting to the ER, the nurses getting me into a room and me begging them for help and getting my meds in my IV (I’m deathly afraid of needles so the IV absolutely disgusted me, especially since my veins were in such bad condition from dehydration). They gave me adavan, saline drips and some zofran. A lady from the detox program came in and spoke with me, and once I got more stable I talked to her more. I had an option of 5 days in detox, with no communication or visitors (I completely understand why) but my business is very important to me, I sell and grow rare, exotic houseplants that require very strict care. I don’t have anyone that could do it for me, if I would’ve been able to FaceTime my husband and tell him how to do it when they needed it then I would’ve, but that was against the rules. So I knew I’d possibly be facing thousands of dollars in losses, as crazy as it may seem.. so I opted for a different route and if I couldn’t do it on my own, then I’d go to detox and have my stuff in order before I left. The other option I had was the ER doctor give me some more adavan and send me in a 3 day supply of suboxon the following morning since the ER didn’t have any on the floor, so I’d have to wait. So I did. my husband said as the night went on, I begged the nurses to k!ll me, and eventually I started hallucinating and I thought our dogs and reptiles were in the hospital room. He said I talked to them for about 30 minutes then I dozed off. He said I kept waking up and doing that, then something worse even happened. I started “my period” when I in the hospital, since I bled and threw up all over my clothes, they put me a gown on until he was able to leave and go get me clean clothes from home. The doctor noticed some very large blood clots and asked about my period. My period has been very irregular lately, and I had no pregnancy symptoms at all. Once the doctor noticed that, he started checking me out *per my husband, I do not remember any of this*. I had an adult diaper on at this point, and in my diaper was a 9/10 week fetus I passed  and some of the tissue. I literally miscarried when I was going through hell, had no idea, and I do not remember seeing it or hearing about that.

Then, they discharged me, my husband brought me home and he said I was still in a schizophrenic rage even after the adavan, and when he got me home he helped me get a bath, try and water and my buspar in me and put a period pad on. He said when he started to tell me what had happened, I broke down screaming, crying, and threw my diaper/pad I had on against our white bathroom wall. And I did, because when I woke up the next morning, it looked like someone was murdered in our bathroom. I’ve never done anything like that in my life and I do not remember any of it. 

Fast forward to Thursday, I had to travel two hours to a clinic that proscribed me suboxon. I did not want to start subs, but I feel as if they’re my best chance to get sober as I’ve done my research and I will be tapering off. I have to go to my clinic every week, and I start with a local addiction and mental health counselor next week, because I have some deep, dark demons that have to be addressed especially after losing our baby. I have to find a way to cope with my sadness, differently than I have been. 

As of right now, I don’t feel great. My energy is low, I’m not sleeping well, but my mind is clearer than it has been being. Since I’ve lost so much blood and got so dehydrated, I’ve been eating plenty of nutritious foods, plenty of electrolytes and water and trying to spend more time doing the things I use to enjoy. 


I hid my addiction for so long because I was too ashamed to ask for help from my husband or in-laws or be honest with my husband about it, from pure shame. My parents would be so mean to me anytime I came to them with any issue, so I kind of carried that trauma with me. Not saying lying and hiding things is ok! I take full responsibility for that. I’ve taken accountability for it all, I’ve apologized to everyone I’ve hurt, especially my husband. And I’m so incredibly grateful that he has been so helpful to me. He helped me bathe when I couldn’t stand, he never hurt me when I was raging out, he makes sure I take my subs the way as directed by my doctor, ect. I’m extremely blessed, and I guess I truly had to hit ROCK BOTTOM to finally get the help I needed and I’m so ready to be fully sober in the future. That experience traumatized me so badly, that I truly don’t even want to think about using again.

If anyone reads my full post, thank you. Thank you for listening to me, and if you’re struggling right now, please don’t hesitate to get help. You deserve to get out💚",19

Yeah, you're not like everyone else are you? I mean how could you be, you're a chronic migraine sufferer, the most normal thing to do is to seek relief.
But that's not it, is it? Because the pain relief was never enough. You need the nod. You want to completely melt into your bed, to be in the state of existence without feeling or fearing. And it's fun, it always is the first few days. Then your tolerance goes up, because of course it does. And it's fine, you'll just do 30mg today. No biggie.
Suddenly you're doing 120mg a day, throwing up half the stuff you eat and unable to stop. And I did stop. Thats the dumbest part. I had recovered and almost forgotten that somewhere in this house is the rest of my grandma's stash. Until I confessed to my mom, and she let the location slip. For 2 months I've been back on them and man, I don't even like the feeling 90% of the time. But I couldn't drink, it's so boring and also lead to me being sick.

I visited my mom Sunday, I have done days without Oxys, it'll be fine. Worst case scenario I would pop two or three and move on. That's not what happened. 
You see, in my naivety I was convinced I am too smart to go through withdrawals that are this bad. It started with one big throw up, Sunday night. Then the sweating began. I vomited bile for a whole day, went to the ER to get an IV for nausea and hydration. I was cramping up and slurring my words. The vomiting continued last night, a night I spent in sleepless agony, throwing up until my lips were bloody and my esophagus felt like a rock. I went to my doctor today, made up some bullshit about chinese food I had Sunday and how it's probably food poisoning. It's probably not. I'm just too embarrassed to admit that I went back on Oxys after all this time.

You NEVER wanna feel like this again. Two IV's and I'm still fighting to keep down sips of watered down gatorade. Oxy's don't make you happy, they make you sleepy. They numb the pain and depression, but so does weed, and that would never do you like this. Just stick to smoking, you stupid bitch. 

I'm not sure if taking Oxy now would help at all with the process, I'm tempted, but ultimately just enjoying not puking every 20 minutes. My head is splitting in half and my stomach feels like a warzone. But I think the worst is behind me now, at least I hope so.

I feel like such an idiot, I was done with Oxys, I never even really liked them. And yet....",14

I’m at ten months clean from fent/heroin and go to NA meetings a lot, and the narrative pushed is that a 12 step program is the only way to recover and total abstinence is the only option. I’m 24 so I’m not sure if my opinions about this are from a lack of experience, so I’d like to hear what people who have long term sobriety from opiates think about this.

Attenuation of opioid withdrawal with high dose ascorbic acid

What's up guys? Long time no see! I have stumbled upon some information that is so profound that I had to come back and visit you guys and share it with you. Please don't be afraid to give this a try and leave a comment about your results and also share with others you know who may benefit from it.

When you know that you are about to run out of your opioid of choice you need to start mega-dosing ascorbic acid (vitamin c). The studies I am going to link at the end suggest taking 300mg/kg, but we have better forms of this compound available now and I have gotten the dose down to approximately 155mg/kg by taking liposomal vitamin c instead of just the regular ascorbic acid vitamin c. This works because liposomal vitamin c's oral bioavailability is 1.77 times greater than regular oral vitamin c.

I am not joking one bit when I tell you that **taking the dose I recommended above will relieve 80-90% of the withdrawal symptoms from a serious fucking fentanyl habit.** If you don't know what I mean by the mg/kg part I will break it down: if you weigh 170 pounds you need to convert that to kilograms (kg) by dividing by 2.2, which gives us ~77.3kg. You then multiply the dose of the liposomal vitamin c (155mg) by your body weight in kg (~77.3) giving you about 12,000mg. Yes, I know, 12,000mg sounds crazy, but it's not really considering one tablet of what I am going to link contains 1650mg. 

You can buy 297,000mg (29g) of liposomal vitamin c from Walmart for $21, which works out to less than $1 a day to feel significantly better. This method is absolutely fucking amazing to use if you are actually trying to detox because vitamin c does not prolong the suffering because it is not an opioid, it just masks a very large chunk of the shitty ass withdrawal symptoms.

I will also add that I did take therapeutic doses of loperamide when I used this method to come off my fent habit. I was able to eat, sleep, and even go to work (pretty much fucked off because this still isn't a magic bullet) all because of the liposomal vitamin c.

Alright, enough from me. Here are some sources:

**Here are some peer reviewed studies on this topic and a brief TL;DR**

*1. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10836211

TLDR: Heroin addicts as patients Control group treated with conventional meds (no vit C) experienced major withdrawal in 56.6% of patients. Vitamin C group experienced major withdrawal in 10-16.6% some bias in this study however if you read into it

*2. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7572147/

TLDR: High, frequent doses of AA may also abort cravings and opioid withdrawal symptoms in those with OUD and has better tolerability than other OUD treatments.

*3. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2852062/

TLDR: Rats addicted to morphine and then put into precipitated WD with naloxone showed far less 'escape jumps and tail flicks' (sort of like RLS) when they were treated with high dose Ascorbic Acid

*4. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6686637

TLDR: In mice: vit C, when co-administered with morphine, suppresses the development of tolerance and physical dependence on the drug

*5. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5107231/

TLDR: 97 patients, half given high dose 50 mg/kg vitamin C, the other half placebo. Both groups given morphine before operation. 2 hours after surgery the VitC group self administered significantly lower morphine consumption and reported LOWER pain after 24 hours than the placebo group (only morphine group)

*6. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4183085/

TLDR: Complex study on mice basically proving VitC had a profound effect when combined with Tramadol or Morphine

*7. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25250292

TLDR: Rats had operation to fix a cannula to their vein, then subjected to 12 days of self-administration of morphine for 12 days, if rats received high dose of VitC before self-admin, they used less morphine, also, rats injected with higher doses of VitC showed significantly less symptoms after naloxone induced precipitated WD. (check out the images at the bottom of the study, very interesting)

*8. http://whale.to/v/c/stone.html

TLDR: Pilot study called *The Hypoascorbemia-Kwashiorkor Approach to Drug Addiction Therapy.* Gives more information and case studies using high dose sodium ascorbate with other vitamins and minerals.


Hopefully this will help a few people, I sure as fuck know it helped me!

I wasn't supposed to live long and was in tremendous pain so dependency and addiction wasn't an issue but I ended fighting cancer for around 11 years. Been found to have no evidence of disease. They don't like to say remission. 
Cancer took everything from me. Feels almost like having all those years taken from me. I was newly married and owned a very successful restaurant with my wife. She was by my side for 13 years before we got married. We had so many adventures, truly living a life I could only dream of. 
Then at 36 I was diagnosed with stage 4 melanoma. It was my wife that made the appointment. I had zero symptoms and now  facing death within months. She stayed with me at the beginning, surgeries and chemo, and then something changed. She moved out while I was in the hospital and served me with divorce papers. I was dieing and she left me. You want to talk about destroyed. The mountain I was facing, I was now doing alone. She abandoned me at the worst part of my life. I don't know how you can do that to someone. 
The surgeries and chemo were brutal, cancer was spreading rapidly to my stomach, intestines, lungs and liver. 
I was in the hospital allot and the restaurant closed down. She abandoned that too.  
Anyway.i honestly don't know if it was a subconscious defense mechanism or what it was. She was remarried and pregnant and I was alone.I lost everything but somehow the weeks turned into years. I've been fighting this for 11 years, lots of MRI, CT and PET scans and years of chemo and immunotherapy and I made through that hell just to be faced with this mother fucker of an opponent.
 I've taken thousands of pain pills being prescribed around 500 pills per month. 10 mg oxy, 8 mg Dilaudid, 30 mg morphine and fentanyl patches for 11 years now. I needed every one of those too. The pain was undescribable. Hundreds of staples and stitches, so many surgeries.
So here I am on my second day and this is up there with the level of discomfort I'm in right now and I've done some painful things. 
I'm done with it but damn I'm alone and would love to communicate with someone with some encouragement or something. Life has beaten me down so much. I don't trust easily. Been years and I still miss her. Don't know if I'll ever get over it. 
Anyway I know I'm all over the place but I'm hurtin. I refuse to believe that I don't have more to do. More to accomplish and maybe even find love again. I guess I'm starting to get the emotional part of withdrawal. Just started so who knows. ",85
180,1jay789,Beating opioids/long post,[deleted],23,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1jay789/beating_opioidslong_post/,"Hi guys

I just thought I would give my story with my battle with opioids  to see if I can help any people.

I started using heroin at the age of 17, to be honest I know it sounds weird but I didn’t even know what it was. I’m from the UK and was heavily into the 90s rave scene, using Molly, speed, ket but only on the weekends  when I was going to allnight rave parties. I would smoke  weed every night though. 

One particular night  I saw one of my friends smoking something off some foil but wasn’t sure what it was and they just said it was something to help them sleep from the come down and called it Brown, bear in mind no Internet then no social media . I decided to try some and thought the taste was disgusting but it immediately brought me down and it helped me sleep

This would continue for some time, just doing it on the weekends still unaware. 

Then I noticed I would do it on a Tuesday and then on a Thursday, put a long story short before I knew it I was almost doing it every day and then one day I woke up And I felt really anxious stomach cramps sweating and almost felt like I was speeding, eyes like golf balls. 

I was at work when this happened and my older friend I told him and he asked me if I’d been using heroin I said I’ve been using something called Brown. He said take this and if you feel better you need to get help,obviously that was methadone. 20 minutes later I felt immediately normal and knew it’s gotten its rotten claws into me. 

From then 17  till 24 it was a downward spiral I lost everything pretty much but luckily my mum and dad still supported me although they did kick me out at one stage. 

I was doing H , crack, benzos sometimes together and surprised I’m not dead. I was also using iv :(

4  failed rehab attempts, then my mother researched a place called detox five where basically they knock you out for five days so supposedly you get over the easiest part of the withdrawal. 

So I went there and did the protocol, like an idiot I never told them I had a benzo tolerance so I actually woke up on day two and I had to give me double the dose. 

I woke up on day five feeling obviously very tired and relaxed from the benzos thinking yeah that’s it. I did not  know  Mr withdrawal was doing push-ups in the corner waiting to smack the crap out of me as soon as I got home and boy it did. 

I literally had zero sleep for around three weeks, rls for a long time and crazily dilated pupils for a long time and  severe anxiety with no appetite or energy.   

I had no friends because they were all users and I literally felt at the age of 24 my life was over and I’ve lost my best friend, there was no information about doing protocols like taking supplements to ease things/vit c protocol and increased dopamine levels it was fucking brutal. 

But as each week/month past I started sleeping that tiny little bit more and getting my energy back. It took  me around almost 9 months to feel somewhat normal regarding the physical symptoms

Then one day I watched a movie called American Psycho, that was the day where I got motivated to go and try and change myself not because he was a psychopath ha ha it was because of his workout routine and the way he looked after himself I know it’s only a movie but still

That day me and my counsellor went to the gym and I got kind of hooked ever since on that, got talking to different people and after around four months a guy got me to do a triathlon with him which I kind of fell in love with. 

One year after that I was competing in ironman triathlons, two years after that I qualified for the world championship. but I’m kind of an extreme person but basically that’s where I was getting my dopamine from and that’s what I got addicted to

My life would continue like this competing in different sports until 38 years of age until my father died and then literally one week after I found out my wife of 10 years had been cheating on me.

So I did not want to be in the same house as her and moved out to a new area with all my belongings. One particular day I really hurt my back in the gym and I had boxes and boxes of codeine p 30 mg. These are from the previous injury but I just kept on collecting them from the pharmacy but not even taking them just collecting them. 

I popped 3  that day and roughly 30 minutes later I was like oh God this feels so nice and it made all the pain I was going through at the time go away and you probably know what’s coming next I got addicted to codeine. 

Of course they  are a different beast to H, fent/oxy

So I will get addicted to codeine from 2016 until 2018. Then in 2019 I lost my brother to cancer and started using codeine again 

Then I quit the codeine again in mid 2020 and I’ve been clean from opioid since. 

Any opioids are a fucking evil drug and some Doctors it seems to me actually want to get you on them I don’t know whether they get commission or something

I’m not sure if my post will help anyone who is trying to quit but my point is if you are trying to quit be kind to yourself in your withdrawal phase and when you’re feeling better find something that you’re passionate about there’s got to be something you’re passionate about. 

Whether it’s working out, hiking , cooking, computers, video games or whatever else

My problem is also I have ADHD so I do get addicted to things quite easily but now I just have to make sure that they’re positive things i  get addicted to

I’m assuming many posts have been written like this on this sub.   I just thought I would share my story to see if it can help motivate anyone

I've also realized something. Every other time I've ever gotten clean, I always knew in the back of my head that I was just resting up for a while. I never told myself ""We're never doing this again."" I'm actually scared this time, and making choices that I never have. I'm trying to be as proactive as I can. I've done this for about 15 years on and off and I think I'm finally tired enough to figure out a solution. I really feel like the street fent scared the shit out of me. This was also the first relapse where I stopped MYSELF. No family intervention. No incarceration. I woke up and I was disgusted with myself. Pretty much all of my physical symptoms have subsided. Now, I'm just grappling with the anxiety and very little sleep. In spite of that, I'm extremely grateful to be alive & clean today. I did some thinking earlier about what is different this time so that I could tell others. I came up with this: This is the first time that I decided to tell myself I'm strong enough to do this instead of telling myself I'm weak. Historically, my will power has ALWAYS been for shit. I guess my point is the shit that we say to ourselves matters A LOT more than the shit other people say to us sometimes. I've always had a good support system of people who love me and believe that I can do it. I never believed I could do it. I believe it now. I just want to say to the people still using or in acutes that you can do it. It feels like it will never pass, but it does. Things get better everyday. Please dont let that wicked voice in your head tell you that it's all for naught. You DESERVE to reclaim your life. ",13

My leg is healed now after the surgery (3 screws and I couldn’t walk for a month) so I’m no longer prescribed pain medication. All I want is to do it again - it genuinely disgusts me that I’m willing to risk my life and hurt myself just to get more pills. I’ve been clean for about a month and it’s all I think about. I hate this so much I’ve been intermittently addicted to opiates for 6 years (since my late teens). I’m 21 and I can’t live like this - I can’t even go to NA because the minute I’m around any other addicts I relapse and encourage others to do the same.

I prayed and prayed for months for God to get me off this medicine because I knew I could never do this on my own. Weaning wasn’t an option because we know we have it so we take it the first sign of uncomfortableness. So this is what happened. The pharmacies I was getting my rx filled from no longer would fill them because the doctor got red flagged. Okay so I found a different place that had the exact one I took. Guess what happened next, the doctor was no longer able to fill narcotics for not just me but for anyone else. Now I don’t know how spiritual some of you are BUT I truly believe that God heard all my prayers and he crashed everything around me so I could no LONGER HAVE ACCESS to that medication. So I had no other choice but to withdrawal and do it cold turkey. I am 4 days in and I’m still struggling with the restless legs and arms and also the hot/cold sweats. On my 2nd day I went to the ER for help because I could no longer bear those electrical shocks throughout my body after nearly 48 hours. That hospital told me “all I can offer you is a bag of fluids” I wanted to jump off that bed and ring his throat. Instead I took the bag of floods and drove home. I fell asleep on the freeway and the only reason I didn’t crash out was from the rumble strips waking me up. I had laid in my living room floor the 2 days prior in agony so my body was exhausted to say the least. I’m grateful and I’m thankful for this deliverance. I’m almost 40 and I want to live a pure life. I know I had to go through this and feel every bit of this so that I would never ever go back. Anyone out there wondering if you are strong enough to do it, the answer is yes!!!! I’m a mom of 3 young kids and not a single soul knew of my oxy use. Each day we wake up we are a little better. You can do this, but only if you’re truly ready too. You have to face it one day. ",43
185,1ml6w8t,Wired shut,Cool_Grass1029,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1ml6w8t/wired_shut/,"Untitled - Anonymous Recovery Story

I was 17. Still on foot, no car. That was safer — easier to run, to disappear when needed. Supposed to re-up that day. Some so-called friends walked up, acting like they were gonna dap me up. Next thing I know, black.

I wake up on the ground, someone’s kicking me in the ribs, another’s digging in my pockets. I couldn’t feel much at first. I didn’t know my mouth was literally hanging open. They took my phone, my cash, whatever I had. I got to my side chick’s house somehow — told her to get me to the hospital.

First hospital didn’t care. No insurance? Not their problem. They said they couldn’t do the surgery there, wanted to send me by ambulance to another state. All I could think was, “That ambulance ride’s gonna cost more than I can hold.” I had a family member drive me instead — against medical orders. Doc handed me a bottle of pills and said, “This’ll get you through.”

I didn’t cry. I think I was still in shock. Maybe just used to pain by then.

Made it to the other hospital. Some doc took the case pro bono. They put me under and wired my jaw shut. Ribs broken, body full of weird fluid pockets. Couldn’t move without pain — especially this burning feeling down my neck and ears. I knew something was wrong.

They sent me home with 10mg hydros. After the surgery: liquid Percocet, 10mg per 5mL. Gave me a 5 oz bottle — I could refill it three times. But every time it wore off, the pain hit like a wildfire in my head. I read the discharge paperwork: “possible nerve damage.”

I went back. Brought the meds with me to prove I wasn’t drug seeking. I didn’t want the pills — I wanted the pain fixed. Instead, the doc walked in, hit me with a needle, and upped my dose.

That’s how it started.

Six months in, I realized I was thinking more about the pills than the pain. My jaw was healing. I could walk. I could breathe. But I didn’t want to stop. I needed them. Not just for pain anymore — for life.

And I had connections. I was already working and selling. I knew older cats who loved coke more than pills. So I’d grab an 8-ball for cheap, sell it off piece by piece, and stack pills as profit. Wholesale perks, retail coke. Simple math. Take a couple to keep myself moving. Morning, lunch, after work. Nighttime was the heavy part.

I started telling myself I was doing it for the money, for the hustle. But I was losing control.

My wife — she noticed things I didn’t. Shallow breathing. Slowed heart rate. I’d stop breathing in my sleep. She’d shake me awake, terrified.

I told her to relax. Told her if she liked the life — the house, the bags, the cars — then I needed to do me.

She looked me dead in the face and said, “I don’t want you to die in your sleep. I need you.”

I’ll never forget those words. Still brings tears. That moment was the clarity. Everything clicked.

I gave my phone to my boy, told him to hold it down, keep people from showing up looking for a fix. Took time off work. Locked myself in.

Day 1 wasn’t too bad… until hour 14. Shaking. Sweating. Couldn’t sleep. Couldn’t sit still. Seizure hit. People told me to go to the hospital. I said, “F**k them.” I wasn’t giving them the satisfaction. I knew if I stepped foot in there again, they’d slap a label on me: “addict.” And I’d never get taken seriously again.

Day 2 was worse. Piss, shit, sweat, vomit — all at once. Felt like my body was on fire. Couldn’t keep water down. Muscles locked up so bad I couldn’t even stretch without cramping. Couldn’t eat. Couldn’t walk.

Day 3, I was still in the shower, curled up, water turned cold. My body was rejecting life. My mind? It was on constant defense. Thinking. Planning. What if someone comes? What if I break?

Day 4, I managed a banana. An apple. Maybe some bread. Still wanted it, but I could stand. Could walk. Wasn’t convulsing.

Day 5, I had pride again. I didn’t win the war, but I survived the worst battle.

And even now — years later — I still twitch. Still get spasms in my sleep. Maybe it’s nerve damage. Maybe it’s just what happens after you put your body through hell.

But I’m here.

And I’m clean.

Not because I’m strong.
But because someone loved me enough to say, “I need you.”

And because I finally believed them.",2

To Anyone Out There Struggling With Opiates:

I see you. I know the war you’re fighting — not just against the drug, but against the guilt, the shame, the grief, and the lies your mind tells you when you’re at your lowest. I’ve been there. I know what it’s like to feel broken, like you’re too far gone, like the damage is too deep to ever come back from.

But here’s the truth — you can live again. You can build a life in recovery that is stronger, richer, and more meaningful than anything you ever imagined. And not only that — you deserve that life.

Recovery isn’t easy. It’s messy, painful, and raw at times. But it’s also beautiful. It's waking up without chains. It’s laughing again. It’s rebuilding trust. It’s finally looking in the mirror and seeing someone worth fighting for. I’m not just speaking as someone who hopes it’s possible — I’m speaking as someone who knows it is. I'm living proof.

If you're in the middle of the storm, if you're barely hanging on, please hear me: you’re not alone. You’re not weak for struggling. And you’re not beyond saving. Recovery is not about being perfect — it’s about being willing. Willing to try again. Willing to reach out. Willing to believe, even if it’s just a little bit at first.

If you ever need someone to talk to, someone who gets it without judgment — I’m here. Reach out. I don’t care if we’ve never met. I’ll listen. I’ll be that hand reaching back when you’re slipping.

We do recover. One day, one choice, one breath at a time.

With love and respect,
S....

Need help pls,pinkestman,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1jhd5r7/how_can_i_quit_this_drug_use_cycle_need_help_pls/,"I never had big ambitions. Growing up, I floated through life, unsure of what I wanted. In my teens my social anxiety kinda stared to ruine my life, so trying to find a solution i started using stimulants and other drugs two years ago. At first, they were perfect .They gave me confidence, improved my depression, and even made me a bit ambitious. I wasn’t addicted to them at least it didnt feel like i was. 

Back then, my drug use wasn't that bad and manageable. I’d use substances occasionally, using them for productivity mostly. But over the months i tried more and more and it keept getting more regular. Until now where my use is often multiple substances daily.

Then I found nitazenes. Normal opioids weren’t pleasurable for me, I tried everything over time it wasn't no more about productivity more about escaping from who i am. I even tried to shooting up heroin but really only nitazenes did it for me. They erased everything. No anxiety, no loneliness, no thought about my future. I didn’t care that my life was stagnant or that I was destroying myself. For two months, I used them daily, chasing that void. I nearly overdosed and felt nothing no fear, no regret. I didn't really saw the problem in dying unexpectedly peacefully.

Three weeks ago, I quit opioids mainly becaue i ran out. But now I’m worse off than ever. My mind is hollowed out. Without stimulants, I’m paralyzed. I’ll lie in bed for hours, unable to do anything really. Simple tasks, feel impossible. I got into stimulants again just to survive, but they don’t work nearly as effective anymore, almost just to feel normal i have to take them. I can take meth and continue to lay in my bed without any motivation for anything. No joy, no motivation, just mechanical existence.  
I can't quit drugs, If I do if feel like I'm going to lose my job and fail school. But I also can't continue doing what I do otherwise my liver is going to fail on me with only 20 years old.

Opioids broke something in me. They made me numb to how broken I was, and now even though I’m off them, I still feel numb to my nosy of my problems. My liver’s still a concern, but that’s not what scares me. It’s the psychological problems, that I can’t get anything done, can’t feel anything well except anxiety, unless I’m high. 

I know I should give myself time to recover, but I really don't know how people are able to get off drugs for more than a year. I keep thinking about opioids even tho they fucked me up. And even if I never touch them I'm still stuck in a loop to fix the consequences from drug use with more drug use. Has had anyone similar experiences? I would be really thankful for useful comments!
Thanks for reading : )

He had been clean for over two weeks and I was extremely worried at this point. We got in an argument because we had plans to see a movie and he was pretty much unresponsive in his car. He said he was at a 7-eleven, then said he was at his house, and then he started to not make sense and was talking nonsense (word salad). I didn’t talk to him for about 30 minutes and I tried to call him again, no response, I kept calling him, no response, and I started to worry something was wrong. I called his mom and she tried calling him, no response. So I made the decision to call 911. He buys his substances an hour from his house so the deputies were looking for him in multiple counties. At this point I was freaking out and I had no idea what to do and felt horrible for arguing with him. Eventually he called me and started cursing me out for calling the cops, and he hung up.

I am new to Reddit. Today I have been sober from fent (and all other substances) for exactly one year. I was a real hopeless case, physically couldn’t recognize myself, mentally broken, and emotionally unhinged. I hated myself and pitied myself but somehow also thought I was better and smarter than everyone else. I thought I was invincible because no matter how much I tried I just couldn’t seem to die. I did at least one terrible thing every day to get what I needed. Never in a million years thought I could get better. 

I am sharing this to let anybody stuck in it know that it is possible. It did not happen in one day but the self pity is gone, the shame and guilt is gone, I have a relationship with my family and friends and MYSELF that I didn’t think was achievable. The single most important thing I did was start listening to other people who have been through this and made it out the other side. I think back and I was always “willing to do anything” to get out of hell until someone suggested something even mildly uncomfortable or unfamiliar. This time I tried actually doing all the things people had been saying might help me for years. Wouldn’t you know, all that stuff helped. Detox sucked but it helped, rehab helped, therapy helped, meds helped, recovery programs helped. 

I used to make excuses for why I couldn’t afford to do that stuff or why it wouldn’t work for me. Frankly, the only real reason i had not to try ANYTHING was that I wasn’t ready to change. As soon as I admitted that I didn’t know what I was doing, I’m not smarter than everybody else, as soon as I started letting others help me, everything got much better very, very fast. I am even kind of grateful for everything I went through because it has given me an incredible appreciation for life.

their Dad has been an addict since I met him.  We've separated several times over their life time but they've never known why.   He's currently in active addiction for the last 3 years. It's become really bad to where I've asked him to leave several times and he keeps saying he'll do better.   Which he has a little. 
However, I don't think I can keep living this way.   17 years of dealing with an addict has ruined my life and has definitely affected how I raise my kids and I'm just so done trying.  I have PTSD, anxiety, depression haven't been able to keep a job. 

My kids have been emotionally affected for sure.... they don't have a normal 'Dad'.  He never comes out of the bedroom. Still has his job so he can financially support but he's not been involved hardly in the last year. 

He would be devastated if I told them.... but I feel like he keeps hiding so he can protect his addiction & protect how they view him?!  

Please help!!  I feel like I can't keep doing this and hiding it from them.   He's not a normal Dad & I feel like they need to know this.  ",42

I take Diazepam sometimes to sleep or Clonidin to take the edge off, but the physical withdrawal is mostly gone. Now it’s the mental fight that’s real. My head’s a bit of a mess sometimes, like pure chaos in there, but I’m trying hard to stay calm, whether I’m sitting or standing, and not let it show.

Big thanks to this community! Your posts, recommendations, and tips are a lifeline and keep me focused. I’m struggling with the psychological stuff, though, anyone got tips for dealing with the mental chaos? Any tricks to stay grounded when your mind’s all over the place?

I thought I would share somethings I've noticed 2 years into this. 

He continues to work SO hard on himself. He's in therapy every other week. He stays in touch with others in recovery. Makes a point about hitting the gym as much as he can (sometimes that's 4 days a week and sometimes once a week.) 

The other day, he didn't get paid on time for a gig he did on the weekend. He was rightfully annoyed with the company (partly because he had to ask why he hadn't been paid yet instead of them notifying him of the issue.) But he also told me he felt a little emotionally triggered from it and it was linked to feelings from his addiction.  Basically, he was in such debt during his addiction, that being paid late would be catestrophic. But present day, it was fine. Annoying and unprofessional but we are okay. 

But recognizing that, I think is so huge. There are tons of little moments like that. They make me so proud of him. He's really putting in the work and it's inspiring, just as humans. ",7

Did you feel healthy again? Did your thoughts change? My hope and prayer is that once I get through the gnarly withdrawals that I’ll stop nodding off throughout the day and have a constant need to “nap”.

230,1i3pcgc,5 months. ,fuckyouyaslut,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1i3pcgc/5_months/,"I made it 5 months and 1 week today. Last December I OD’d for the first time after my first time using after a 3 month clean streak. It was also my first time ever falling out in almost a decade of using. Then a few months after that I passed out in public because I was so weak in withdrawal, that I split my face open on the sidewalk and got 12 stitches. Then a few months after that, I got clean for the billionth time (this time). 

This is the first time I’ve ever made it this far. I use Kratom to keep myself from slipping up, but lately even that feels like a cheat of some kind. Which seems ridiculous because the last few years have been hell trying to get myself off fent. So I’m trying to remind myself that I’m in a better place now. It’s not even a comparison. But I guess it’s a good sign that I feel this way right? 

I’m just not trying to get too over confident about any aspect of my substance abuse because I realize it only takes one fuck up to fuck up again. 

My life feels quiet and calm and stable for the first time and I’m grateful that it is. I’m working a lot and finding happiness in things I thought I wouldn’t give 2 shits about. Like people. And food. And activities I thought were “meaningless”, because I wasn’t getting high. I used to have to scrounge $100 daily before food, rent, any part of life. Just to get me through my day. Just to not get sick. I just couldn’t live my life like that anymore.

231,1huadmh,Day 500!,Deathofme_0,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1huadmh/day_500/,"Just hit 500 days sober today! The holidays are always a bit tough for me (since I’d always ruin them with my addiction in the past) but I’m proud of myself for getting through and happy to still be on my recovery journey after 15 years of addiction.

I’m also 80 days sober from weed which is another thing I thought would never happen. It’s funny, while opiates and weed are totally different (I have a medical card), the mindset is similar. On both drugs I thought I could never be sober, I would be awkward or people wouldn’t like me, I wouldn’t be able to survive really without them…but less than 2 weeks after stopping both; I realized the exact opposite is true. I find myself more present than ever, I feel less awkward in social situations, I’m saving even more money; and I’ve been progressing in EMDR therapy like crazy since stopping weed.

I was using weed to help stop my horrible nightmare/night terrors. While it was a good crutch, I got to a point in therapy where I felt stuck basically. I stopped smoking (only because I was trying to get a new job) and found myself making leaps and bounds in therapy I never thought possible. My therapist noticed almost immediately too! Even though I only stopped smoking for the job, I’ve decided to not start back up again! While therapy is still incredibly hard and I have a long way to go, I have made it SO far and I can’t wait to look back in another 500 days and see the results!

This year, my goal is to find an in person meeting that I can be apart of. I have been completely shocked to find how much solidarity and being around likeminded people helps me. I’ve always been someone who’s never really wanted to go, but lately I feel the need for support and want to capitalize on those feelings.

I hope anyone still in the throws of addiction that sees this, knows it’s really possible to get out, you just have to be ready! There are so many resources out there, and I’m always here and happy to help any/everyone I can. I thought I was alone, I could never be helped, and I was better off dead; but I was so wrong. 

And to my friends that are in recovery, keep fighting the good fight! I don’t post in here often these days, but I’m in here almost daily reading your inspiring stories and it helps more than you’ll ever know. Message me anytime for anything, and thank you all! ♥️",5

Is there any way out?,lucyblu663,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1hrlrpn/5_months_sober_and_still_hate_my_life_and_am/,"I’ve been sober 5 months now and I feel like nothing has changed. I feel the same, live the same monotonous life that I realized very quickly only worked for me while using and feel like I can’t get out. I have no friends and therapy and the occasional meeting is not enough, but I feel like I’m incapable of reaching out and putting in the effort to find community and connect with others. I’ve realized I’m mentally ill and it isn’t going away with being sober, I’ve tried so many medications that often make it worse and have been on various meds and in therapy since 15. I feel like there isn’t hope for a better life and I’m so tempted to give up and start using again just so it can be easier to get through the days. I’ve lost everything I cared about and so many opportunities to drug use and despite being only 23 I can’t convince myself that it isn’t over for me already, it feels like it has always been like this and always will. My issues started long before substance use but I haven’t had more than a few days sober (until now) since 16. I don’t know how to live and no one is going to hold my hand through the process of learning how to be a person. I don’t have any motivation because I feel like it’s a losing battle and I’ll never get out of this hole I’ve dug myself. I have ptsd and it’s extremely hard to connect to other people and be vulnerable enough to make new connections and trust that it will be ok, so I find myself completely alone all the time as the rest of the world gets further and further away, and my world gets so small again. I felt like this often while using and was convinced it’d be better when I got sober but it isn’t. The small amount of progress I finally made that convinced me to get sober cuz I finally had hope for the future is completely gone. I keep finding myself thinking maybe it’ll be better on my next try, as if I’ve already given up and know I’ll be using again soon. I don’t know how other people function and move forward. I can’t stop thinking about everything that’s ever happened in my life and I live completely in the past agonizing about everything, I have nothing going on in my life and nothing to bring me out of my head and I’m too cowardly to move forward and find good things for myself and do anything I know would help. I finally got a sponsor last month and have stopped texting and calling, every time I reach out I end up not responding for weeks again, I don’t speak to anyone at work, I feel like a ghost. The only thing that keeps me going is the thought of leaving here forever and just forcing myself to live, I finally got my drivers license, renewed my passport, drafted my two weeks notice- but the end doesn’t feel any closer, I don’t feel any better, it still feels so out of reach. I don’t have confidence I’ll actually do it. In my head I think there’s two options, move in to sober living in another state, find a better therapist, new job, maybe iop- or drive for a while, get out, and come back and start using again until I have hope I can make it and do better. I think so much about using and the comfort of giving up and resigning myself to waiting and ignoring again. If I don’t try, I won’t fail, I won’t ever have to realize it really won’t get better. I’m so tired of waiting for something that may never come and trying for something I might never get and feeling like I’m failing cuz I’m not ever doing enough. Even in iop, going to meetings regularly, everything I was supposed to do I felt so trapped and hopeless. I just want to know there’s some end in sight, some light at the end of the tunnel and this all might be worth it. That I can actually turn things around and have the strength to do it for myself and it won’t be forever that I feel like this. Sorry for how long and depressing this is I just want to know that someone has felt this way and made it out",29

234,1ou1f7f,Day 30 Quitting Suboxone - My Story,Slada1,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1ou1f7f/day_30_quitting_suboxone_my_story/,"Today is day 30 since quitting Suboxone cold turkey. First off, I want to say thank you to everybody who has offered their encouragement over the last thirty days. It means a lot to me. Now, I figured I'd do something a bit differently today. I've given this some thought, but I'd like to share with you guys my story. I'm not entirely sure if this will help some of you out, but perhaps it'll add a more human dimension to the previous posts I've made. I know I've kept things mostly positive over the last month, but clearly I've made some mistakes to be in this predicament. Despite what the posts might suggest, I'm not perfect. I was weak. I struggled the same as everybody else dealing with addiction. Before I continue, there are some parts that might be triggering to read, so you have been warned. Here is my story:

Nearly a decade ago, I was essentially a model student and athlete my senior year of high school. I was a varsity athlete in two sports, my GPA was nearly a 4.0, I had 10 AP courses under my belt, and I volunteered often. I was in a relationship with a girl I had known for about a year at that point. I had a solid circle of friends who shared my interests. I even had a best friend who referred to me as a brother. We innocently started dabbling in weed and alcohol on weekends during nights where we'd hang out and play video games together. Eventually, my best friend started doing drugs alone. Unfortunately, I didn't see this as a sign of mental health issues. I was busy with life and college applications at the time, and he never approached me with his issues. That's usually how us guys are, so I didn't press him further on the issue. It's one of my biggest regrets to this day. I woke up one morning to frantic text messages and phone calls from mutual friends. My best friend had run away from home. I tried desperately to reach out to him, but he disconnected his phone. I prayed he would return. The only thing that returned to me was a message late at night from an unknown number saying ""thank you for being a good friend to me. I'm sorry, goodbye [my name]"". The next morning, police confirmed that he was dead. He committed suicide by jumping in front of highway traffic. This is the event that caused my life to spiral downward. I had lost the one person I truly considered a brother outside of my own family. The anguish in my heart never really faded from that day on. I was denied admission from my university of choice and went to another in-state college, but I hated it. There was a lot of crime and homelessness in the area which made it dangerous if not depressing. I also had to commute nearly 2 hours one way using public transportation which always had some crazy people on there. There was also the issue of traffic in the mornings and afternoons just to get to the metro station. In addition, I had to work part time at a shitty entry level job to pay for transportation costs which included my used car to get to the metro station. The professors at my university didn't even teach under the pretext of an ""inverse class format"", which was awful for STEM majors like me. The point is, I felt like I worked my ass off throughout my teenage years for nothing. I began to question my own existence. One day on the way back from classes, I met a guy I knew somewhat from high school. He said I looked beat, which I was, and recommended I try kratom. I had no idea what he was talking about, but he said it was this herbal supplement that helps with mood and energy. It sounded too good to be true. I decided to give it a shot despite being skeptical, so I stopped by a local smoke shop and purchased a small bag of white maeng da. That day when I got back home, I cracked open the bag and took two grams to try it out. About half an hour later, I experienced the best fucking feeling I have ever felt in my life. It was as if all the happiness and joy I could've felt from my accomplishments up until that moment were transformed into some green powder. Suddenly, the transits to and from college seemed a lot less bothersome. I didn't have any anxiety over tests anymore. I had more energy to study and work. I was on cloud nine. At the time, I had believed I found the cure for my declining mental health. Initially, even my girlfriend was happy I found something that worked for me. However, all it did was repress my real emotions and fatigue. About a year later, I suffered a mental breakdown and had to take medical withdrawal from all my college classes for the semester. My parents were encouraging and said I should take a gap year to take a break and reorient myself. I went with their suggestion, but I began to self-medicate with kratom even more. One day, I ran out of my stash. I told myself it was no big deal, until I started feeling sick several hours later. I convinced myself it was the flu until I bought more kratom and felt better after half an hour. A realization dawned upon me. I was addicted to kratom, a plant I thought was just an herbal supplement. Panicked, I tried to stop, but the withdrawals were intense. At this point, my parents began to notice something was wrong. They found my 250 gram bags and I had no excuses. They tried to take it away from me, but I'd always hide some more that I bought secretly. The addiction began to drain all the money I had saved from work. Then, COVID rolled around and I had no job. Even the unemployment money I got was spent towards kratom. Soon, I resorted to stealing. Not just cash from my parents, but kratom from gas stations when the attendant was gone. At that point, I was eating powder by the spoonful multiple times a day. I was a fucking fiend for kratom. My girlfriend who I had known for about four years during this time saw the writing on the wall. She tried to convince me to stop, but I didn't listen. I lied and made excuses, which eventually she caught on to. That was the last straw for her. She abruptly left me, saying she hated what I had become and never wanted to see my face again. Then, my parents who found out about the stealing were enraged. I overheard my mom tell my dad ""that's not our son. He's a monster"". It was only during that private conversation that I learned I was an accident. I was thoroughly devastated. At that point, I had nothing left to lose, and yet I was determined to lose the one thing I should value the most. I drank a bunch of liquor and stabbed myself in the throat with a knife. Thankfully, I missed my carotid artery by half an inch. I was found passed out and bleeding, but alive and taken to a hospital. Then, I was sent to a psychiatric hospital. I was put on Suboxone and Wellbutrin during my stay until two weeks went by and I was deemed fit for release. I was given another week's supply of Suboxone to taper down from and that was it. Little did I know, PAWS from kratom was lurking around the corner. It hit me like a tidal wave after my last dose of Suboxone. After a few days, I couldn't take it anymore and relapsed on kratom. My parents found out and kicked me out of the house. I was homeless besides my car, but at least I still had some money. It was a few months before I found a job, and another several before I found an apartment to rent with three other people. Life seemed to be shaping up to something better, but I was high on kratom all the time so it was hard to tell. My entire life at this time was just long shifts at a dead-end job to pay rent while the rest went towards drugs and other necessities. I wasn't just doing kratom at this time either. I was getting drunk and smoking weed almost every night. I also picked up a nicotine habit. Between that and work, I did nothing else. I didn't have any friends. My entire free time was spent doing drugs and lounging around in my small apartment room on my phone. Frankly, I thought I could live like this forever. That was until kratom began to affect me differently. I began to have noticeable body tremors whenever I was anxious, and then it shifted to having body tremors all the time. I couldn't function like a normal person in public or at work anymore. At this point it had been three years since I was kicked out on the street and five years since I first knew I was addicted to kratom, so I had likely damaged my body and brain. It was not until a visiting family friend who had known me since I was a kid met me one day and said ""Jesus, are you okay? You look sick"" that I knew I couldn't live like this anymore. I looked at myself in the mirror when I came back to my apartment that day. My skin was pallid. I had visibly dark circles under my eyes. I lost at least 20 pounds in weight. I was a husk of my former self. I truly became the monster my family said I was. I decided I had enough. I got a Suboxone prescription through telehealth and for the next five months I tapered from 4mg down to 2mg per day. At this point, Suboxone had also begun to show its own side effects. I was sick of it. I called my family and explained my situation. Thankfully, they were willing to take me back. However, it was on the condition that I quit all drugs with random testing as proof. That included Suboxone. I weighed my options. Did I really want to rot away for the rest of my life as a poly-drug addict at some entry-level job living paycheck to paycheck in a shitty apartment with multiple roommates? Or would I rather get clean despite the withdrawals with zero comfort drugs if it meant I could have a fresh start and regain the trust of my family? I chose the latter. Today marks the thirtieth day since I quit Suboxone, and also the thirtieth day I began to turn my life around. For once, I can say that I am a man who survived hell and is free from the shackles of addiction for good.

Hopefully my experience has resonated with some of you regardless whether you are just considering getting clean or are currently going through withdrawals. Just know you are not alone. It is possible to beat an addiction to opiates, even ones as powerful and long-lasting as Suboxone. If I can do it, surely you can too. Have patience and be kind to yourself. Eventually, you will be free. I'll see you all tomorrow for my last daily check-in.",10
235,1o6opim,From Kensington streets to home. What a journey.,brodney90,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1o6opim/from_kensington_streets_to_home_what_a_journey/,"""Your girl is almost here,"" he announced, his voice devoid of emotion. ""She's gonna watch you die"".

Those words were spoken to me while I was locked in a trap house as a woman's boyfriend kicked me in the head and ribs. They thought I had robbed them, and they lured me there to get revenge. This was just one of the moments from my nearly six years of being homeless and addicted on the streets of Kensington, Philadelphia.

It's a crazy story. I went from being a correctional officer to a full-time ""hitter"" on the street—a guy who injects others with drugs for money to survive. My life became a cycle of hustling, boosting, getting jumped, and running from the cops, all while battling an addiction to fentanyl and tranq that was literally eating my body alive with flesh-eating wounds.

I was completely hopeless and had resigned myself to dying out there. Then, during the brutal winter of 2024, I got severe frostbite and collapsed on the street. That single event led to a choice in the hospital: a long, painful, and uncertain fight to save my feet, or a double below-the-knee amputation.

Losing my feet was the most traumatic and horrifying experience of my life, but it was also the one thing that finally got me off the streets for good. It forced me into a recovery I couldn't run from.

Today, I'm home with my parents. I have my prosthetics and am learning to walk again, and my girlfriend Britiny is also clean and in a sober house. I've spent the last several months writing my memoir, *Kensington Beach*, to tell the whole unfiltered story.

It's been a hell of a journey. I'm open to answering any questions you guys have about addiction, life on the streets, recovery, or what it's like learning to live again.

I'd also me completely honored if you were to check out my work or even just my page. Thanks guys

Honestly the burnese method worked so well that I’m pissed it isn’t talked about more. I was barely sick at all throughout the entire process despite being heavily addicted. Started at 17, I’m about 3 days clean at this point. For the last 3 years I didn’t even get high off the stuff it was just a bottomless pit I threw money into so I could remain functional. What’s messing with me rn is this constant restlessness and the fact I can’t sleep at all. I feel super unmotivated to do anything, I feel like I should start going to the gym or something in order to get a routine going. I’d love some advice for how you guys managed early recovery ",17
237,1nxl3yh,I’m coming up on 2 years clean and don’t really have anyone to share it with who gets it,brittynicole1019,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1nxl3yh/im_coming_up_on_2_years_clean_and_dont_really/,"Hi,

I don’t post often so here goes. 

Back in 2021 I wanna say, I started using oxy recreationally and eventually started using more and by 2022-23 I was shooting up heroine. 

I was in a very unstable and unhealthy relationship with a guy who had been using and got in to it that way. 

I ended up overdosing and coming back but didn’t even quit after that.. I vividly remember coming to and was being pissed that I fucked up my chance at getting well… 

I mentioned moving out of the city I was living in and moving closer to where I grew up to my family and they basically saved my life unknowingly. Because I moved to a city where I knew no one with the stuff I needed. They thought they were helping me get out of a toxic relationship, which they were but also before I overdosed and didn’t come back. 

I took the month before I moved to try to detox and ended up putting myself in withdrawal. I had a planned birthday vacation with my Mom in Vegas and before we left ended up in urgent care and then after we got back ended up in the ER again so she knew something was up. And so I ended up coming clean to her about everything.

There are only a select few people who know I ever used. The toxic ex and his friends. My very close group of 4-5 friends. My mom (she has tried to explain to my dad how rough of a situation I was in but he refuses to hear about it). And my now fiancé. 

So, I guess I just wanted to come on here and kinda say I’m proud of myself for not slipping and wanting to tell someone that IT’S FUCKING HARD EVERY DAY EVEN WHEN YOU ARE CLEAN FOR 2 YEARS! 

I genuinely have my friends and family to thank for getting me help out of the situation I was in. That’s my biggest advice for anyone on here looking to stay clean. Surround yourself with people who want to support you and won’t judge you! 

Thanks for listening! 
Stay safe and healthy!

Still had cravings for years but it wasnt like this. I truly do not care about anything. I feel genuinely willing to leave my life behind to shoot dope. I have everything going for me. A sane person would have nothing to complain about. And I don't complain about it. And thats why I'd rather die than watch my life slowly implode around me. 


I am buying drugs tomorrow. I am might feel that crazy rush once or twice and then it will be the same banal shit of getting high all day just to be able to put my pants on.

241,1kt6808,I’ve been off opiates for 6 months I still don’t feel the same.,The_Goon_420,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1kt6808/ive_been_off_opiates_for_6_months_i_still_dont/,I’ve been on Suboxone for past 5-6 months but my treatment doctor just stopped answering we usually have a meeting monthly so now I’m forced to quit subs but even then I still get cravings I still miss the high from dilaudid and oxy. Maybe I’m just in a tough position in life and that’s why the cravings are bad. But I feel abandoned I’m 21 years old I have no choice but to taper off my suboxone with only a few left I try not to take any. But I easily get depressed but some days I feel good. Like I can feel great one day and depressed the next and I don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve been trying to get into better habits and routine but every so often I get craving for drugs. I wish I never touched opiates because the feeling would’ve never interacted with my brain. If I never experienced that high I would have nothing to crave. Maybe I’m just feeling alone because my gf is back with her family for the summer and I’m so used to her being around. Maybe I don’t have enough going on in my life atm. I think it’s a good thing I’m getting off suboxone because I won’t have to rely on it. But I just hate these ups and downs my brain is fucked. Anyways this was a random rant. ,38
242,1krayt4,13 years clean and sober,skimask808,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1krayt4/13_years_clean_and_sober/,"Every once in a while I stop by in this sub reddit to share my story, to hopefully inspire the addict who is still suffering. It also gives me a chance to reflect on the things that worked and went well for me in my recovery, and the times I may have fallen short as well. To start, I am in my early 30's. I started using opiates when I was 14 years old. I remember because I was a freshman in high school. I was having a really rough time in school. Depressed, constantly anxious, and started hanging out with other people with similar issues. Surprisingly, most of my friends didn't use any substances. But I remember one day I was going through medicine cabinets at my house and I found a full bottle of 40mg oxycodone capsules. There were 120 of them. This is where it all started. 

The next week I skipped school most days, and got completely obliterated at home by myself. It was the first time in a long time that I felt truely happy and like myself. There was a switch that went off where I instantly recognized that I had found the thing I was looking for my entire life. My story isn't unlike many others, once the pills ran out, I realized I had a family member who had lupus and was being completely over prescribed opiates. Oxycodone, hydrocodone, oxymorphone, hydromorphone, and even at one point fentanyl patches. No idea what the doctor was thinking prescribing that much. But this set me off into full blown addiction. 

Eventually they noticed the meds were going missing after almost a year. So I had to find something else. This is where heroin came into the mix. IV use came shortly after. This went on for 3 or 4 years. Getting kicked out of my home, losing everything and everyone who loved me wasn't enough to stop killing myself with substances. Even losing my girlfriend of 5 years wasn't enough to stop. I pushed everyone away who actually cared, and continued using, almost to the point of trying to die for a long time. 

Then came the day I overdosed. Valentine's day, February 2012. I woke up in a hospital and a police officer was there. He gave me two options, they found heroin and needles on me and said he could charge and book me for possession of narcotics and paraphernalia, or I could check myself into inpatient rehab. Seeing my parents faces was enough to realize that this was my one chance to turn things around, and I might not get a second chance. So I checked myself into a rehab (surprising the best choice of one too) and started my journey to recovery. 

The recovery part could be a whole new post, but to try to wrap things up as quick as I can I'll just explain what's happened since then. I graduated recently with my bachelor's in Psychology, and am pursuing my master's in social work right now. Should have it in the next year or two. I got licensed in my state as a substance abuse counselor (in training).  I started working about a year ago as a substance abuse counselor, and got the opportunity to intern, and then work at the same rehab that saved my life 13 years ago. I give speeches to new patients weekly, play golf with the same psychiatrist that saved me in 2012 regularly. 

I still deal with cravings. Life still can get crazy and throw me curve balls regularly. But now instead of using I call a friend or talk to a loved one about what im going through. I cope with stress differently now, helping others truly does help me. What I am trying to say is no matter how dark things can get, remember that there is always a way towards recovery. In beginning it can be incredibly hard to stay sober, but after you have a little bit of time, it gets so much significantly easier. You can find out that you do deserve happiness and you do have something positive you can contribute to other people's lives too. Traditional 12 step groups work for a lot of people, but I didn't use them to get sober and don't teach too much about them when I'm running groups. There are other ways to stay sober. 

To the addict still suffering, and the ones who are just starting your recovery journey, keep fighting. Don't give up, no matter how bad things are. Things will get fucking tough before they get easy. But you will never know how great life can be if you don't stick with it. Reach out to people if you need to. And thanks for anyone who got through this jumbled mess of my thoughts today. Best of luck!",7
243,1jltklg,I’ve never experienced withdrawals this bad what else should I expect?,Reasonable_Spend_907,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1jltklg/ive_never_experienced_withdrawals_this_bad_what/,"
Hey i’m a 19 YO who had access to slow release oxytocin, oral morphine and codeine due to my step grandfather being very ill and i had to mind him overnight as he couldnt remain unsupervised. 

I live in the UK but i’m now back in Ireland visiting home for just a week the last opioids i had was slow release on Tuesday (18th) however even the morning of Tuesday (before quitting and taking my last dose) i was unable to eat my breakfast and barely ate that day at all over the few days of being off the opioids i felt like a normal sickness just a stomach bug but it lasted much longer than usual from Tuesday till Saturday and on Saturday is when things really kicked off 

i was throwing up even just sipping water it was horrible i don’t think i need to go into details you get the picture just throwing up for 48 hours while also getting about 6 hours sleep but again i thought this was just a sickness so on Monday i went to A&E (accident and emergency) to get checked they took bloods gave me fluids and anti sickness (neither helped a whole lot) which is when i started to suspect it would be withdrawals rather than just a illness 

the doctor gave me some prescription for stomach acid regulation which i’ve no idea if that helps in anyway or could even make it worse. the doctor also said if it continues or gets worse come back and so two days later (wednesday) i was the same not being even able to keep a mouth full of water down i went back and they said the exact same thing gave me fluids anti sickness and sent me on my way 

it’s friday now and im finally starting to be able to keep sips and a bite down but that’s literally it just one single bite of toast and two sips of water if ive more im in agony for a bit and throwing up all over again 

In short im asking if this is normal from opioid withdrawals from what i see online it’s pretty typical im just looking for people or have been through this and or have any advice on how to deal with the coming days even if they are much better than what i’ve already been though. Also sorry for the lack of and random punctuation im still in pain in my stomach from not eating enough and throwing up 

PS: i don’t have any negative feelings such as depression or irritation all the mental stuff i seem okay and able to handle it just seems to be physical which is also why i was thinking it’s just a sickness rather than withdrawal 

Thanks for anyone who responds i hope your having a wonderful day :) ",43

He hasn’t made any effort to leave.   
I know he has 30 days but I was hoping he would go sooner and I even offered him money to go sooner. I expected he would have some feelings about being broken up with. About not really having the means to leave but also not being welcome here.   He hasn’t made any plans. He has expressed nothing.   Is this oxy?  Just literally no feelings about anything?",35

You might not be able to do it right now, maybe not tomorrow or next week or next month but you will be able to do it. It took me a decade to start to find my footing, and even then I wasn’t in the clear. But if you’re still breathing you have a chance. Just keep in mind especially if you’re on fent like I was that if you don’t do it eventually you’ll lose that chance. ",7
248,1i1ek3g,7 days clean from opiates,truepisces93,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1i1ek3g/7_days_clean_from_opiates/,"I did this detox a little different this time…. I’m not going to lie I got out of this very easy after 3 years of using everyday….when I stopped I was taking 200mg of oxy a day…I took Gabapentin for anxiety, mirtazphine for sleep, and I smoked canna….during that binge I decided to get off my medication, and I stopped smoking for a year…so once I get clean my body won’t be used to the meds and they will work properly…I took my last pill last Tuesday at 1am, went to the methadone clinic Tuesday  morning….i took 30mg on Tuesday , 40 mg wednesday, and 40mg Thursday…didn’t go back Friday…..I’m not getting hooked on methadone again, I was on it for 3 years 5 years ago and I went through 6 months of withdrawals it really messed up my brain….I couldn’t even walk down the stairs properly…it’s like my mind wasn’t telling my legs to move, it was so weird…I  just needed it for the 3 days of hell and it did the job….only felt mild withdrawals first day on it, so I went up to 40mg and I felt nothing at all! I started back on my Gabapentin and mirtazphine  which did wonders since my body was no longer used to it….the mirtazphine I didn’t need to take until last night….so i slept perfectly fine for 6 days….what helped the most was the canna felt like when I first started it…. i have detoxed a lot of times and always broke after day 6……this is the easiest detox i ever had….i kept telling myself the methadone is still in your system, you will feel it once it’s out…then day 5 came of no methadone and I still felt okay….now this method worked for me because i only took opiates….i was very careful during my binge and pulled out my test strip, and tested them in the car with the guy right there……im not sure if this will work for F…..now for the root of the issue when it comes to my addiction….i am diagnosed with adhd and i started getting a script for adderall last year, but never took it because I heard it dangerous to mix with oxys….so I just stacked them up….everytime I relapsed which has been a lot it was because of my adhd….I just wanted to feel “normal” so I self medicated….oxy was the only thing to somewhat help my adhd….this morning I felt good when I woke up….then the adhd started to mess with me….racing thoughts in my head started the anxiety…. I’m sitting on the couch looking at the mess the dogs made last night and I just can’t get myself to get up and clean it….so I decided I’m going to start on my adderall today and I wish I found this before the oxys….. I might have never fell addicted….my mind is finally quiet and I got up and started deep cleaning with the music on….I feel amazing I am focused and I have no anxiety…didn’t even take the Gabapentin today which is crazy…..I am so excited for the future…I’m proud of myself for taking that last pill and fixing the root of the problem…I am going to manifest it now, I will never use again! Taking it one day at a time ",6
249,1hu6xi4,Day 4 feeling…. Wow,Wheretheproblemsat,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1hu6xi4/day_4_feeling_wow/,"So here I am in the kitchen with my husband (we’re both on sub) singing the new lion king song totally forgetting that we were feeling like absolute garbage just 4 days ago. I’ve never had a withdrawal that hasn’t had me down for at least a few days before feeling somewhat okay. We both went to work like nothing was wrong, eating and drinking. Doing whatever we can to make sure that we don’t fall into feeling crappy. 

We’ve planned for activities both inside and outside so that we can stay distracted and won’t get bored because boredom or being stuck in your head can easily trigger a relapse. We’ve stopped taking naps so that we are tired enough by the end of the night to sleep throughout the entirety of it. Take showers to avoid RLS. And spend time in the living room with family instead of being in our room. Something needed to change, we needed to change. We were so miserable being stuck in our heads about what went wrong, seeing everyone live life. We need to do that instead of being upset that we don’t. The money used for drugs could be used to go to the movies, out to eat, skating, bowling, anything! But we spent it all on drugs and would be so sad and angry that we didn’t have money to do what other ppl our age are doing (23). No more, no more woe is me. I cannot guarantee full sobriety but I can guarantee that I’m done letting drugs dictate my life and I will do whatever I can to make sure I never fall victim to pills. I won’t let pills make me not want to go out, leave work early to go pick up, take off work because I hadn’t gotten more, make plans and not sticking with them because I was high at the time, and other bull crap. 

I will make it to every doctor, rehab, and therapy appointment. I will go out and try to make friends. I will continue to date my husband and flourish our marriage. I will work hard and earn money to help my husband financially take care of us. I will stay on my prescribed medications. I will live life and not be afraid of the world anymore. I have to. ",11
