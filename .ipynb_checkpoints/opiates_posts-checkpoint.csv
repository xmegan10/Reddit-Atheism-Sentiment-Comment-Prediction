0,1hvaxqv,We need to legalize opium,legal_opium,285,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hvaxqv/we_need_to_legalize_opium/,"For centuries, opium was openly used to treat life-threatening conditions like dysentery—no Narcan, no modern medicines, and yet no societal collapse. In fact, this access to a potent, natural remedy helped countless people survive severe illness and increased overall life expectancy. Now, despite all our medical advancements and overdose-reversal drugs, we’re witnessing unprecedented opioid-related deaths—directly tied to strict criminalization that drives opium (and stronger synthetic opioids) underground. Legalizing opium simply acknowledges a proven historical reality: societies prospered, lives were saved, and harm remained low when opium wasn’t demonized or forced into illicit channels. If we truly care about preventing overdoses, keeping patients safe, and preserving personal freedom, the straightforward answer is to stop criminalizing a natural medicine that has served humanity for millennia.

I find it ironic that people think if we were to legalize opium that addiction rates will soar and society will crumble. Yet that never happened in ancient Greece or ancient Rome or any other society that flourished while having legal opium markets. ",194

9,1j12xf6,This Sub Does Not Like Opiates,-TheDevils_Advocate,161,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1j12xf6/this_sub_does_not_like_opiates/,"I get that the drug use communities are meant to be used for harm reduction and that is a good thing. But why is every post this circle jerk of users framing opiates as this impossible to resist devil?? I saw a post around here with someone claiming to not have hell-ish withdrawal symptoms even after near daily long-term use get downvoted. The top comment was someone straight up telling them they were lying. Around the same time I saw another post with the top comment being somebody claiming his tolerance skyrocketed to 700mg oxy a day and no one called bullshit. Is that really more believable than weak withdrawal symptoms???

It seems like there is a lot of bitterness from opiate users here who have had issues with drug abuse and push their experience onto others. If you say you have been a long term user without having serious issues, the comments are always a weird combination of “that’s how they work. It’s all under control until it isn’t” or straight up calling you a liar. And its to the point where I question this sub’s reliability on opiates when a lot of the discussion comes off as ‘war on drugs’ talking points and ‘scared straight’ propaganda.

Edit: Clarified that it was 700mgs of oxy

Edit 2: This thread is exactly what I mean. Most of the top comments are users telling me about the annual deaths of opiates and their personal struggles with opiate addiction. There is no regard for other factors that are to blame there (like prohibition being a huge destabilising factor in the downward spiral and death of addicts rather than the actual drug used). All of this is the same old washed up pharmaceutical narratives. If I tell you that I have had the exact opposite of you experience with withdrawal symptoms then I am the liar. If I tell you that most hard drugs are not as addictive as you think and most of their users are casuals ( [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDebate/s/npJvBYXvhv)) then I am the liar. If I tell you that other factors such as social stigma and prohibition are more responsible for drug deaths than opioids I am suddenly the liar ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/s/k2gTW4SmET)). Have you ever considered that you are one of few irresponsible users brought down by different factors and that others could benefit from advice on avoiding laced drugs other than the old “trust me bro”.

Edit 3: I’m noticing a bunch of people read my comment on the 700mg of oxy as if I am suggesting it is impossible to get there. To clarify, I am pointing out that the idea that someone can consistently maintain consuming 700mg daily long term is NOT MORE BELIEVABLE than someone who uses 4-6 days out of their week having light withdrawals (because actual research has been done that backs weak withdrawals up). The only reason it gets treated like it is is because people here have trouble believing someone who says they use without falling into serious issues (which is statistically and historically proven).",124

i’m 20 years old. i do full time school and have a 3.9 gpa in STEM, im a waiter working 30-40 hours a week making 4-5k a month. i have my own place, my own mercedes (paid off) all from my own money and hard work. 

if i choose to do some oxy in my free time, or even if i grow dependent to it. it is so annoying to hear people talk down on me like im a bum. even though i use drugs i literally do more than most people my age. 

using drugs isnt what’s bad about using drugs. it’s really about the money. if drugs were free they literally wouldn’t even be that bad. 

on top of it, i never do drugs infront of people who dont like them, i never bring drugs around people who dont like them because i would never wanna run the risk of getting in trouble with drugs and having someone with me get in trouble too. i never pressure people to do drugs. 

i have NEVER let my friends try my drugs, no matter how much they ask. i just choose to do it to myself. i know the harm i may cause, but honestly compared to nicotine, and alcohol using oxy isn’t even as bad health wise. 

people smoke weed everyday, and weed literally makes you dumber if you smoke it under the age of 24, no one says anything. people drink every other day and it fucks you up physically and gets you hung over and makes you a nuisance and it’s considered cool. people vape and literally triple their chances of getting cancer. 

in my 3 years of using opiate pills daily/3x a week with a few bad stints of fent (depending on how bad the habit was), my health is fine. i do routine checkups im in perfect health. the only bad thing is lower test, but im currently working on that. 

I KNOW drugs aren’t good for me and they’re not a solution, (i should probably do therapy instead) i know nothing good comes out of it. but i don’t agree with how it’s made out to be, sure they’re bad, but they’re just as bad as everything else people do. but drugs get the most shit. 

the reason people see drugs the way they’re seen now is because of the stupid war on drugs. drugs are so bad nowadays because of the war on drugs, that led to fentanyl and all the shit that no one wants to use but has to use when they’re addicted and pushes them to OD and homelessness. but you also have homeless people who just drink, and that was majority of homeless people in the 20th century anyways, it’s not exclusive to drugs. 

the government and media pushed the narrative that drugs are terrible (which they did with alcohol in prohibition), literally just to put more minorities and prison and make more profit from the prison business. if you seriously do some research you’ll see that using drugs recreationally without a physical dependence isn’t even that bad, it’s just like drinking every now and then in my opinion. 

let me know if you don’t agree, or if some of the things i’m saying are factually wrong, i’d love to be educated more on the topic. this is just my rant. 

i posted this to like 3 subreddits and got it taken off. it literally shows how people are so blindsided to drugs and literally can’t think critically. 

TLDR: 

drugs aren’t that bad, they’re as bad as alcohol nicotine weed. they’re not the devils spawn. people who treat drugs like some force of satan are just too easily influenced by what they see on tv and social media. ",197

She then spent a couple months floating the streets being homeless and then attacked by men on the street. She was addicted to Crack and Heroin especially with fent. I don’t know how to process this we haven’t even gotten her autopsy and she’s so far from us. She told me so many times that she wanted to come down and I should’ve brought her back to our home town. I did everything I could to try and get her resources and she didn’t want it. The girl she was staying with was the one to call me after the police arrived and told me she went to lay down and never check up on her until the morning to give her a kiss on the cheek and she was cold. She then had to do CPR but it was already too late. Now she won’t respond to me and it’s sus bc my sister just died. Our family is now putting the money together to fly her body back and have a service which is expensive but we are trying to get donations. At the end of the day she passed in the most peaceful way possible and I already miss her so much. She was only 22. Is there something I could’ve done to chance this or stop it from happening? I am her sister and 21. 

Edit: I have never touched drugs in my life but a lot of members in my family struggle with addiction. My father and Mother both struggled form addiction and my mother passed in 2020 from neglect in a mental health hospital. My sister also had BPD and PTSD from events that happened in our life.

So I’m sitting there on the hospital bed and in comes a DR with a shot full of liquid fentanyl ready to stick it in my IV.

Calling someone “clean” because they’ve stopped using these substances is not only stigmatizing—it’s inaccurate and harmful.

Here’s why this matters:

Not all use is addiction. Opiates (natural substances like morphine and codeine) and opioids (synthetic or semi-synthetic drugs like oxycodone and fentanyl) are used for pain relief, recreation, or dependency management. Assuming all users are “dirty” creates unnecessary shame.

“Clean” implies moral judgment. Using opioids or opiates doesn’t make someone “dirty.” This language unfairly paints all use—whether recreational, medical, or dependent—as negative or immoral.

It erases nuance. Dependence, addiction, and responsible use are different experiences. Using judgmental terms like “clean” oversimplifies these distinctions and stigmatizes everyone.


The better word to use is “abstinent.” It’s neutral, factual, and doesn’t carry the moral or emotional baggage of “clean.”

By changing how we talk about opioid and opiate use, we can foster a more supportive and respectful environment—one that acknowledges the complexity of these substances and the people who use them.

Words matter. Let’s focus on respect, not stigma.

Feeling embarrassed, ashamed, not as energetic, always sad, it was a perfect breeding ground for an opioid addiction. I didn't really know what I was getting into, and you really got to go thru it to really understand what people go through. I'm fucking stuck more then ever, I wake up in withdrawals constantly switching from Oxy to hydro's,  to 7-oh to suboxone , just to hold me over, then Ill switch again and again. I can feel my brain not moving as fast as it used to, but at this point the feeling of euphoria overpowers any sort of rationale I have in my head. I'm spending my paychecks getting high and playing drums, not doing shit. It's time for a change and I know the only one whos gonna change it is my ass, I'm tired of this fucking shit and I know people have it a lot worse then me, but I just can't handle it. I've always been the strong dude all my life, not really giving too much of a fuck, but I'm aware to know where this could lead and where IT IS GOING TO LEAD, I'm not sure if this is the right sub for this, but I need advice and help. I've been in pain since I was 14, and its so hard to get help, I don't know where else to turn, I don't know if one of these days will be my last. I don't even know if this is the right subreddit for this, if not I apologize...

EDIT: I take anywhere from 160 to 220mg of oxy , so translate that to 7-oh and hydros and so on, it never ends the handfuls.

EDIT: for people asking if I have ever been prescribed opioids? : Yes I have, pancreatitis is like the most painful thing I go through, feels like someone stabbing you in the abdomen constantly.  I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy, but of course they cut me off because they wanted to try ""alternatives"" which never fucking worked. Went looking for other doctors, but they just send me home with codeine, and that doesn't do jack shit.

EDIT: for people asking what I do for a living I've been doing plumbing, HVAC, and power-washing since a very young age, all taught by my father. I haven't been certified or apprenticed, not in any sort of union, I just get calls every-week, do what they ask most of the time and get paid.

EDIT: Thank you for all who are actually trying to help me! You have no clue what some of your words have done, I feel like maybe there's hope for me to stop being such a pussy.",161

I’ve only been using a few months, only using dillies. I picked up a bad batch yesterday unknowingly, didn’t get my shit tested. I went down hard. Luckily there were people around that noticed. I stopped breathing for 10 minutes, went completely purple. They did CPR and narcaned me 5 times before I woke up. I woke up incredibly confused and upset. Got taken to the hospital via ambulance, threw up everything in my stomach. 

I’m alive. And I’m so fucking grateful to have woken up this morning. I’m hoping there are no long-term consequences to my brain after being out for 10 minutes. I’m just posting this because I always thought it would never happen to *me*. That it was just something that happened to hardcore users. Be careful out there folks. ",98
36,1ig4y54,I got ass*ulted by my plug this morning. TW: SA,Baby_Brat_xoxo,105,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1ig4y54/i_got_assulted_by_my_plug_this_morning_tw_sa/," I asked to hold a gram from him until your money comes, so like 2 days? he said yeah come on so I drove down to the cities. Mind you, I did NOT owe him any money at this point in time. Not that that would make this ok, but I felt I should disclose that before we go on. 

	He told me to get in the backseat when I get in the car, ok cool I just figured someone else was in the car sitting up front- nbd. Then, he locks the doors and drives away from where we parked. Again, at this point I don’t think anything is wrong... I figured he just didn’t want to sell in the same spot he had me park my car, he’s done it that way before, although he did let me sit up front that other time he drove away. 

	Next he takes me to an alleyway (far enough from my car where I don’t remember how close it is to this new location so I wouldn’t have been able to walk ((or run)) and try to find it). He parks. Following that, he moves s both the driver’s seat and passenger seat all the way forward to the dash and makes sure the seat backs are folded forward.... at this point, I start checking to see if I can get out of this vehicle if I need to. Nope. Child lock is activated on the back doors. 

	I have no idea wtf he’s trying to do, I’m confused and assume he just wanted leg room or something maybe he had to make more bags and needed room for the scale??? Who the fuck knows. 

	He gets out, gets in the back seat, and takes out the blicky and points it directly at me. I’m staring down the barrel. I don’t know anything about guns, so I can’t tell if the safety is on or off but I’m looking directly at a handgun with an extended clip. I don’t have my pepper spray or your knife. I have no idea how the FUCK I’m going to defend myself and get out of this situation or try to get the blicky from him.  From there, he pulls his pants down then said,  “you know what to do if you want that.” He grabs me by the hair with one hand and holds my wrists behind my back with the other and tells me to “get to work”. The Blicky is pressed to my temple, he’s still holding my hair but not my wrists and right now I’m terrified. 

	Then he (still holding my hair) pushes me onto the seat so that I’m face down. I’m crying and snot is running down my face. Then ripped my leggings off of my legs, and spreads my legs apart aggressively and inserts himself. Dry, and hard and fast. (Blicky still pressed to temple. I’m crying, scared to fuck, OH and sick as fuck also. Just praying it just stops and is over) he says things to me like:

	“You little junkie whore.”

      “Your man’s in jail so this pussy is mine. I’ll take care of you; he can’t.”

     “Your man don’t need to know.”

     “He told me to take care of you while        he gone.”

    “This what you get for wanting a front.”

    “Fucking dope whore.”

   “You’re such a little slut ain’t you.” 

   “Once you go black you neva go back.” 

   “You a cum dumpster dope fiend.”

	It hurt really bad and he was a lot bigger than I expected (NOT in a good way) and like I said it fucking hurt. It was awful and I still keep crying over this. He went in completely dry. I have bruises on my wrists and legs, luckily he didn’t touch my me anywhere else.   

	When he was done he got off of me, grabbed toilet paper that he keeps in his backseat and fucking handed me a HALF GRAM. 

I didn’t go to the hospital cause wtf am I gonna do? Walk in there and be like this man made a dope whore out of me. 
I don’t fucking know. But what I do know is that this wouldn’t have happened if my man wasn’t in the workhouse rn. He always did the business he always dealt with the plugs I usually just stayed in the car and let him do his thing and now I have to be the one who does the thing and I don’t fucking like that one bit. These plugs PREY UPON desperate junkies like me who want a front. They want to see how the fuck they can exploit them for more and more. 

Personally, and this might be a hot ass take but I think opiate dealers who don’t do it themselves are a special kind of devil. Because they willingly contribute to the dope supply knowing damn well the fucking crisis that is the opioid epidemic. Idk don’t come for me in the comments. 

I’m checking myself into treatment by the end of the week because baby this ain’t it and I told myself once I was getting fucked for dope or ever felt even close to having to do that it’s a fucking wrap and we’re done. 


Edit:  I posted this here with NOTHING to gain. My one trusted person is in the workhouse right now, I can’t talk to him until he calls and so far he hasn’t been able to call today. I don’t have anyone else I could talk to about this besides obviously the authorities which I know I need to talk to but honestly I don’t fucking trust em and if strangers on the internet are going to sit and discredit me over a minute detail why the fuck would I want to talk to cops about it. Yes, I called it a blicky. So what? I could’ve called it a piece? A strap? A fucking gun? It all means the same thing (to me) anyways who cares what I called it. The people in the comments discrediting my story because of how I wrote it IN DISTRESS are gross. Nitpicking my story detail by detail is also gross. Shit like that is the reason why people like me stay silent when shit like this happens. 

To those of you who have been kind, thank you and I hope your pillow is always cold at night and I hope that everything you eat for the rest of your life is delicious. To those of you who have been trying to ask if this is made up or say it is, I hope you have the day you deserve. 


Edit 2:
If you’ve read this far, kudos to you. 

I went to the hospital last night. Got checked out and made a police report anonymously. They said that things looked ok as far as their preliminary tests go and that they would send my tests off to the lab and call me if there is anything to worry about otherwise I will see my results in my chart. I feel a bit better now that I did that part and I will be taking time for myself to heal and work through this trauma. ",282

44,1ouvkm2,Why using in moderation isnt great either,Lazy_Dimension1854,91,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1ouvkm2/why_using_in_moderation_isnt_great_either/,"Opioids, if moderated, are typically physically safe, but never mentally. A lot of ppl here say, “can I just take it every week will there be issues?” Yes, its not impossible, its just incredibly miserable having to live your life where the only thing you think about is your next high.

Reasons being:

1. its not overrated. Opioids feel absurdly good. I read tons of euphoria stories before trying it for myself and I wasnt anything close to underwhelmed. Its one of very few things in this world that are better than expected.

2. Your first high isnt the one you chase. The first high blows, its like the 10th or 20th high that is the best. Once you know the perfect dose to nod without blacking out, once you find the best source, or once you feel the contrast of powerful euphoria and mild withdrawals, you will never stop missing the opioid high.

This is why I believe its almost impossible to get high in moderation and not get super frustrated with it. Ive done it before, moving through small amounts of pills very slowly. The feeling of craving something is very annoying. Especially in a boring world where opioids make everything absurdly euphoric, even scratching your head. Live your life being a little bit bored, coping with weed and TV shows. You will appreciate it in the long and short term.",81

I get there's promethazine in it and that potentiates it but all that does to me is put me to sleep. I've taken promethazine in pill form with some hydros and it wasn't anything special. Now rappers can do whatever tf they want they got the money for it but i still think its dumb. These teenagers on the other hand that trend sip to seem cool are straight up dumb. If you really wanna do opiates you could pop like 4 perc 5's and be higher than sipping 2 lines of lean.

Old heads that remember me, I'm still kicking.

Some background.

I started using pills daily when I was 14 back in 2004.

Did opis every day until I ended up on i.v. heroin at like 23/24.

Went homeless, went to jail.

Met a chick and moved in with her.

I was a roofer for a bit 

Once fent started becoming widespread in my area in 2015ish I diversified my portfolio and shit.

I went from shooting a gram of ECP to drinking a liter of vodka a day and eating 200-400 mg of lope every 24-48 hours (and became the default community lope expert because I'm the only one it didn't fucking kill apparently)

I did that for a few years while roofing and then came here thinking I had found the opioid cheat code.

Everyone here promptly told me how regarded I was and shared stories about how their loved ones had their hearts explode and died because they took massive lope doses for an few months.

I quit the lope cold turkey and upped the vodka.

It was a solid 1-2 months of methadone-like withdrawals (because of the long fucking halflife and shit)

I got drunk every day for a few years and wrote half a book that I think I shared most of here.

Started a job that I took super serious at a small local company.

Got a DUI and probation and had to quit drinking so I transferred the addiction to work.

I ended up going from a part time helper to a store manager in a week, then a district manager, president of the company March 2019, C.O.O. 2 years later when we went from an LLC to a corp.

Im still with the chick I met fresh out of jail (and her two kids)

I bought us a house and we got a German shepherd and then a Rottweiler.

Work stayed my addiction with some alcoholism and a few years of Adderall addiction mixed in.

I've been on kratom for like 5 years (a kilo a month) and have been fucking with 7-oh lately, but in buying grams online instead of wasting money at smoke shops on bunk.

I quit my corpo position in February because I didn't get a bunch of what I was promised.

I have tried everything to help him, and he just won’t stop using. He will one day be sober and completely honest with me about his using, then the next day it’s back to lying and saying he’s not high. And if I suspect he’s high and ask him, he will gaslight me into thinking I’m crazy and curse at me for thinking so (while he’s nodding out).

Yesterday he met with me after work to see a movie, but he looked high again (not super high this time like usual. He usually does 150 mg by snorting it). So I just asked to go home. He got super upset and said he drove all the way to see me for nothing. I told him I don’t wanna be around him when he uses anymore. He started crying and saying I’m so fucked for saying that to a sober person, fuck you, etc. 

At this point I feel like I’m just making things worse for him. He’s sorta stuck in a loop where he will try to be sober for 5 days and then go back to using for months. I care about him and love him so this entire thing is so hard on me, I mean even his mom told me he emotionally abuses me over his drugs. But anytime I try to talk to him about how it makes me feel he blows up on me and says he won’t talk to me until I fix what I did. I feel like relationships shouldn’t be this way.

60,1nbk9xg,The amount of misinformation about Fentanyl on an opiate sub is staggering.,Local_Dragonfly_8326,81,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1nbk9xg/the_amount_of_misinformation_about_fentanyl_on_an/,"Misconceptions:

1. Fentanyl has no recreational value:
Wrong. Fentanyl is an extremely potent opiate that effects all the same opiate receptors as your favorite opioid it just has a much greater activity at the receptor. This means for most people a dose that is euphoric is also going to be very sedating. 

Oxy is a 1 on the sedation scale and a 10 on the dopaminergic euphoria; it is very euphoric and not sedating. Heroin is a 8 on the dopaminergic euphoria scale it is very euphoric but it is also a 5 on the sedation scale it is rather sedating. Fent is a 10 on the sedation scale and a 2-3 on the dopaminergic euphoria scale; it is very sedating at euphoric doses. 

2. Fentanyl withdrawal kicks in in a couple hours: Wrong as someone who used intramuscular fentanyl daily just to stay out of withdrawal a .2g shot of ~1-5% fentanyl will keep me well for 24 hours. Even a wash will keep me out of withdrawal for ~12-16 hours. And it takes 36-48 hours to reach full withdrawal. This one is somewhat anecdotal but it's also based on observation of others.

3. Fentanyl causes symptoms like increased absences; dry mouth; low blood pressure: feinting; inability to remain conscious: Wrong these symptoms are caused by Xylazine which is in 99% of the fent on the east coast and eastern Midwest.",56

I knew it was coming although i feel like the reasoning as to why the feds are moving so swiftly to get these off the shelves is because they want to act like they prevented the next wave of the opioid crisis, and the ban is rooted in politics and not consumer safety, science, of public health. There is even a USA Today article on the topic where a sub headline states “Has Killed Thousands upon Thousands” Interestingly enough since the mass popularity boom of 7oh there has been a decrease in the amount of fentanyl related overdose deaths in the country. Obviously this cannot be all attributed to the rise in popularity of 7oh but i would be surprised it didn’t play quite a substantial role. Overall it seems like the feds once again are going to push users back out onto the streets and kill what should be the safer alternative in the guise of “defending public health”",149

I must have looked really fucked up because my manager told me to just go home. Next shift I go in I was fired and my manager told me to get help for my addiction. Wtf can they do that?

Has anyone else been caught using at work? If yes were you fired? Curious to know others experiences. 

EDIT:

I know they can fire you for using illegal drugs I’m not that dumb I meant because they didn’t see me using or find a needle or anything. 

I should have put the full story in the post but I technically shouldn’t have been working. I got injured AT WORK and they denied my workers comp claim so I got on a LOA for 400 days. I need rotator cuff surgery. I can’t pick up even a point with my injured limb and this happened again at work. Haven’t had surgery because it’s expensive af and I don’t have insurance from my company either so I have put it off. I was appealing my loa to get it extended but until then I had to go to work or be fired that way. I started using after I got injured because until the LOA is approved you have to work. So I started using again to be able to even do my job because the pain is horrendous. I do have proof to show I do need surgery and I am injured because I know they’d say I’m lying about that. That’s what I was doing with the company that facilitates LOAs. That’s shady imho especially denying me workers comp when the doctor I went to said I was injured and I reported it as a work injury.

It's cathartic for me, and I sincerely hope helpful for anyone struggling and wanting to get clean. 

10 years ago I was visiting my family in NJ. We were going to spend the holidays with my family. It was lovely. My brother seemed to be doing great. He was playing with my kids and laughing and having such a great time.  He had supposedly been clean for a few months at this point. On Wednesday he told us he wanted to really make a change, because even though he wasn't using he felt stuck. He said he wanted to come to church with my family that upcoming Sunday. And maybe he would finally take me up on my offer for him to come live with us for a while. There was a really toxic situation between him and our dad. 

On Friday we were all going to go this dinosaur event with animatronic dinosaurs or whatever. For the kids. But that morning he said he was going to meet up with someone to play disc golf instead. We all went to the dinosaur thing. Came home, normal day, but never heard from my brother. As the night got later my mom was freaking out. I really didn't believe the worst could have happened. Even when my brother was using he told me he was a ""smart user"" and not like those ""other dumbasses"". I've never used opiates before, so words like ""test shot"" and whatever he did to ensure his safety went over my head.  I assumed maybe he met some girl and was staying with her. 

Then the next day came and went, with no word or sign from him. At this point my parents had tried to file a police report, but a 28 year old missing man wasn't high on anyone's priority list aside from ours. 

He had a tablet at the time, and I decided to look at his history. He was on Reddit all the time. Specifically this sub every single day. At this time I had never heard of Reddit. I created an account (username makes sense now?) and posted here, probably breaking all sorts of rules but the mods were really nice and let it slide. Many, many redditors reached out with great advice, and some even volunteered to call hospitals and police stations for me. (Unfortunately I was not tech savvy at the time, and I didn't know how to see what my brother's username was. I wish I did, though I think he was definitely more of a lurker than a poster.)

Another day and sleepless night passed and I started to agree with my mom, something bad must have happened.  We looked at his EZ Pass charges and saw the last charge was in Newark on Friday. We drove all around Newark, but didn't see him or his car anywhere. All the calls redditors were making for me weren't turning up any leads either. We went home, still trying to convince ourselves that maybe he took off with some ex-gf or something. But when we got home, just a few minutes later, two detectives from Newark NJ came knocking on the door.

They told us that they found a body they suspected was my brother. They told us he was dead, probably for a few days based on the condition of his body. They thought he was a homeless John Doe, because instead of helping him, someone stole his wallet. Since I was visiting from out of town my brother let me use his bedroom, and he put a lot of his stuff in his car, creating this situation that made it appear like he had been living out of his car for some time. Really he was staying with family, but was keeping clothes and personal things in his car.

I'm assuming he was robbed after he died because his car looked trashed, his wallet was missing along with expensive hockey gear, and dog grooming tools. I'd like to get angry at whoever decided to rob his dead body instead of trying to get help, but really I can't imagine living a life where you're so desensitized to seeing a body like that you don't think twice about taking whatever's valuable.

My brother was a single, 28 year old man. I don't think he felt like he had any really close friends, was estranged from our dad, and I imagine that he never dreamed his death would matter much anyway. He couldn't have been more wrong. It's been 10 years and we are still devastated. The entire family that used to be so close has completely shattered. I'm the oldest, and our baby sister is just a shell of herself. Our brother was her person, and losing him sent her into a spiral, I'm not sure she'll ever find her way out. My mom doesn't speak to her sisters, and all the cousins that were once like siblings are splintered.

  
The truth is, I thought this would get easier with time. But siblings are supposed to be there to age with you. I turned 40 last year. My brother should be 38, and we should be talking about our aging parents together. He should be the fun amazing uncle to my kids. He should have his own family that he wanted. He would have been such a good dad. Please, if you think no one would care if you died, think again. The ripple effect is unreal.

  
I'm sorry this is getting so long. I just wanted to share one more part of the story. My brother's best friend from high school came to our house as soon as he found out. I don't remember the last time they saw each other, but he just walked in the front door, hugged my mom and they both sobbed uncontrollably. Then he went into my brother's room and trashed it, while screaming, ""YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE! HOW COULD YOU DO THIS! YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE!!"" I went in and he looked like a wild animal. He finally sat on the bed and cried, and told me how much they had talked about this. How my brother had promised him he was done with this shit, and he would call if he ever felt like using again. 10 years later this friend is now carrying out a sentence in mental hospital. There were a lot of factors, but I do think losing my brother really broke him too. 

Was my brother trying to use  one last time before he came to church with us and really committed to changing his whole life? Or were we all fooled, and he really was never clean? Had he been clean long enough his tolerance was lower? Was there fent he didn't know about in whatever he shot up? We'll never know. But I do know this, there's no safe way to use heroin. Please, please don't convince yourself you're smarter than the next guy. My brother never stole from anyone, never went to rehab, and never OD'd before. He had been using heroin for about a year before he died. This drug doesn't let you get to rock bottom. 

Thanks for letting me share. I don't think I'll continue the yearly posts, 10 years seems like a good time to end this tradition. ",35

78,1mq6x20,PAY ATTENTION,Automatic-Fan5329,71,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1mq6x20/pay_attention/,"🚨 FDA & DEA ARE COMING FOR 7-OH – KRATOM IS NEXT 🚨

The FDA has been pressuring the DEA to schedule 7-hydroxymitragynine (7OH) — a natural alkaloid in kratom.

If they succeed, kratom will be next.
Here’s why:
7OH occurs naturally in kratom, and 10–30% of mitragynine (the main kratom alkaloid) converts into 7OH in the body. You can’t ban a major alkaloid of kratom and expect the FDA/DEA to stop there. It’s already happening.

Florida’s Attorney General just emergency-scheduled 7OH, skipping the normal legislative process — and relied entirely on lies and fear-based misinformation, just like the FDA. They presented no evidence or science to support their claims. This is an attack on our freedom of choice for a safe, effective alkaloid.

Louisiana, Connecticut, and nearly Texas have already fallen. Tennessee is pushing for a full kratom ban next year, and Ohio is considering the same after RFK Jr.’s anti-7OH comments.

Reality check:
    •    Over 500 million doses taken with zero confirmed deaths from 7OH alone.
    •    No surge of ER visits, no public health crisis.
    •    Lawmakers are being fed misinformation by special interest groups, including the American Kratom Association — which protects donor vendors while pushing fear to target others.

If we don’t act now, pain patients, recovery patients, and everyday people will lose a safer alternative, and a full kratom ban will follow nationwide.

📢 Sign & share the national 7OH ban petition to stop the DEA/FDA from scheduling 7OH and protect kratom:
👉 https://chng.it/5FNVKYff6v 👈

This isn’t just about 7OH — it’s about the future of kratom and our freedom of choice for a safe, effective alkaloid. The science doesn’t lie: people aren’t dying from 7OH, but they will die from actual dangerous alternatives if this is taken away.",87

They can tell I'm high within minutes. If that didn't give me away the constant itching all over and pinned pupils would. For me oxy feels like a stimulant without the negative effects of a stim like racing heart, anxiety, comedown etc. I feel like it's impossible to feel depressed while I'm high. Mix oxy with nicotine and coffee and I feel like a damn super human. 

Basically oxy doesn't feel like a downer to me at all. I've been at it for perhaps 5 months ish (with breaks) and it takes around 40-60 mg for me to get sufficiently high. Before I would get blasted from 20mg so I plan on taking a tolerance break soon. Anyone else relate?

My son went into a rehab yesterday to detox and was sent to the hospital because he had severe symptoms. He is unable to talk and can barely move for about 20 hours now. he has detoxed before and it’s never been like this. The hospital is telling me this is normal, but I’m really worried that he had a stroke or something like that. He’s trying to detox from the combination of fent and tranq. did anyone have these severe symptoms and how did it go for you and how long did it last? i’ve never heard of being unable to talk before as a detox side effect. They got him on Dilaudid, Valium, and clonidine.

UPDATE the brain CT was taken and came back negative, so no stroke! I am so relieved. Still concerned about the weird symptoms, but hopefully there’s not going to be a life-changing medical event like a stroke would be. thank you for all the advice and prayers. I will definitely continue to update so we can all understand these symptoms and what they mean

2nd UPDATE the doctor told me that they’ve been giving him an antipsychotic called Olanzapine. I never heard of this for detox before

I found out they also gave him ketamin. Could this contribute to the symptoms he’s having?

3rd UPDATE after stopping the Olanzapine he woke up and can talk! He’s still shakey and doesn’t feel good but it’s what he looks like whenever he goes through withdrawal. ",141

**Key Takeaways:**

* The Taliban has enforced a major ban on poppy cultivation for two years now (2023 & 2024).
* Cultivation dropped dramatically—down 95% compared to 2022. In Helmand, the heart of Afghan opium, cultivation fell from 128,000 hectares to just 740.
* BUT there’s still no opium shortage... Why? Because farmers and traders stockpiled huge inventories of opium before the ban.
* These stockpiles are feeding both domestic and export markets. Prices surged after the ban, but then fell again in 2024 as the market adjusted.
* Heroin purity destined for Europe has stayed stable so far, but local/regional products are increasingly adulterated.
* There's a real risk that if the ban continues, we may start seeing more potent synthetics (like nitazenes) replacing heroin in some markets.

I love this sub, and the advice I got was spot on. You all really helped me out so much, and I deeply appreciate it.

I had my appointment with my pain doctor today. I took everyone's advice and didn't mention Oxy or any med by name. I told him the hydrocodone isn't working as well as it used to and I'm also concerned about continuing to take acetaminophen daily. I asked him if there was a similar med without the acetaminophen that would work better and possibly longer that I could switch to. He said, ""Yeah, we could switch you to straight Oxycodone if you're okay with that ."" It was his idea. He told me it's 1.5 times stronger than hydrocodone and I played dumb like several people suggested and said, ""Oh, really? Sure, I'll try it,"" lol. He switched me from hydrocodone 7.5/325 3x per day to 5mg Oxy 3x per day. I know 5 mg is a low dose, but I think it will manage my pain better since I have such a high tolerance to hydro. I'm really happy about the result. He was totally cool about it, didn't hesitate.

Anyway, I just wanted to thank you all so much for helping me out. It will be life changing to have more adequate pain control. I really could've screwed myself asking for Oxy directly. I'm really glad I took your advice. It worked perfectly and I'm happy with the results. You guys are fire!",38

i used to never consider it an addiction because i had enough self control in the past with other drugs. a few days ago my dealer stopped replying and yesterday i had the worst withdrawals of my life. i finally consider it as an addiction now. my dealer responded and i just couldnt help myself. this shit is hell.",40
120,1htxiuf,I’m writing something and am trying to describe dope sickness to someone who’s never experienced it,diamond-therapy,57,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1htxiuf/im_writing_something_and_am_trying_to_describe/,"Would love some feedback…did I forget anything?

Lots of people compare it to the worst flu you’ve ever had—I disagree. It’s not just being sick; it’s like your body is betraying you, turning every moment into an excruciating eternity. For most—including myself—it starts with uncontrollable yawning, the biggest yawns you’ve ever had, coming relentlessly every few seconds. Your eyes water until tears stream down your face, and your jaw starts to ache from the constant stretching. But these aren’t normal yawns—they’re the first sign that something is seriously wrong, like your body is trying to expel something it can’t reach.

Then comes this creeping anxiety that won’t go away. It claws at your mind and makes your heart race as if you’re being chased—but you know you can’t run because the horror is coming from inside you. The panic is paired with a deep, gnawing dread, like every bit of hope has been drained from your soul.

Next, there’s the sweating. Hot one minute, freezing the next. You’ll be drenched and shivering at the same time, your skin crawling with an unbearable sensation, like bugs burrowing beneath it. You can’t get comfortable—ever. Your legs, arms, everything aches, throbs, or twitches uncontrollably. Even lying still feels like torture because your muscles won’t stop screaming for relief.

You’d think you might get relief when you go to sleep, right? Wrong. You’ll toss and turn all night, wide awake, trying every possible position to find one that’s comfortable. It doesn’t matter how cozy you try to make it—you’ll feel every fiber of every blanket and sheet against your skin. It’s either too soft and tickles, too itchy, or too rough. It’s too hot with blankets and too cold without them. You’ll want to be naked, but if your clammy skin rubs against itself, it’ll send shivers throughout your body. Occasionally, you might pass out for a few minutes, but it’s not real rest—it’s more like your brain glitches out from exhaustion before waking you up in a panic, like the feeling you get when you wake up hours late for work.

You won’t be able to eat or drink either, thanks to the constant nausea and cramps. If you do manage to choke anything down, it’ll likely come right back up or go straight through you. It’s like your guts are in open rebellion. Between not being able to keep anything down, the diarrhea, and the constant need to pee, you become dangerously dehydrated and malnourished. Pair that with lack of sleep, and you turn into a complete zombie, stuck in a nightmarish state of delirium.

All your senses become so intense it feels like your brain might short-circuit. The lights are too bright, everything smells and tastes too strong, every touch is painful, and every sound is too loud. Your emotions become completely out of control and unmanageable. You’ll cry out of nowhere—sobbing, snot running down your face—feeling like the most pathetic creature alive. Every regret, every mistake, every ounce of shame you’ve ever felt comes rushing in, drowning you in guilt.

 And then there’s the need—this overwhelming, all-consuming urge that screams in your mind. It insists that one small action will end the nightmare. You don’t just think about it—you feel it in every fiber of your being, like survival itself depends on it. The worst part? You know that giving in only resets the cycle, but enduring another endless minute, hour, or day feels equally impossible.

Once you’re more than a day into it you can’t even do anything to try and fix it. the only way you’ll get relief is if someone helps you. You can’t hustle at that point. I’ve been so sick and seen people so sick that can’t even talk let alone walk. Even if you do get more dope somehow you are so shaky, you can barely even do it without assistance. When you’re in such absolute rough shape, reduced to just a leaky, disgusting delirious shell of a person,  very few people will want to have anything to do with you let alone help you. It is nothing if not humbling.",52
121,1hjy52h,this is the best time of year to be sober ,LonnieJay1,56,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hjy52h/this_is_the_best_time_of_year_to_be_sober/,"I've spent plenty Christmases hooked on opioids or otherwise struggling to stay off them. I remember feeling like such a fucking loser as everyone gave and received gifts, while I sat there with my stingy ass little gifts for a few people. I felt so uncomfortable with the small talk and the nice clothes, it was all just unbearable 

Going into Christmas with all my shopping done already, the gifts for my daughter and extended family already wrapped, and ready to host my girls family on Christmas Eve feels great. I feel like I'm actually capable of getting ahead of life sometimes, which is a feeling I never had while I was using opioids

I'm able to be responsible, which feels better than any drug ever did. Seven years ago on Christmas I was in detox for a polydrug IV habit and ready to ice myself. For anyone who is struggling and doesn't see a light at the end of the tunnel, i can tell you that it is there",26

Then they injected blue dye into the mice. Half the mice were given morphine after the tbi. Then they tested the mice on cognitive tests. The mice who were given morphine showed significant increased cognitive ability. Then they killed the mice and did an autopsy of their brains. They found that there was significantly less blue dye in the morphine mice, showing that morphine restores the blood brain barrier post tbi. 

This proves that opiates have a neuroprotective element to them beyond mere analgesia.

123,1ogoim5,I got off the train,Wild_Significance261,54,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1ogoim5/i_got_off_the_train/,Currently on day 4 of cold Turkey from 60mg oxy a day and I just took my first solid shit in 4 days. Honestly I took a massive dose of mushrooms 4 days ago and that’s what has kicked this off. It was an amazing experience and it left me wanting to get off the drugs. It was far less easy than the previous times I took a break. My energy was completely gone. Appetite gone.Bed was damp with sweat. But my resolve held and today I wake up dry and I don’t immediately have to run to the toilet. Still feel like a slug. Stomach doesn’t feel amazing but it’s nice not feeling the crushing urge to take more oxy. 2 years of opiods is finally coming to an end I feel. They’re the best feeling drug ever for the first year or so then it just becomes this dance of trying to space your doses so you never feel the withdrawal. So you can just function. I’m fuckin done fuck that shit. Got a life to live. ,19
124,1jnymqp,"Too much stigma around opioids, thanks to medical gaslighting.",[deleted],56,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1jnymqp/too_much_stigma_around_opioids_thanks_to_medical/,"I believe majority of us here “abuse” or should I say, self medicate opioids and opiates for a legitimate reason. Sure, a lot of us use far more than we should, but I strongly believe and research backs this up that there is a legitimate, non “oPiOiD abuse DiSoRdEr” issue with our brains, called endorphin deficiency syndrome. Before anybody comes on here saying we’re deluding ourselves in to thinking our use is normal and healthy, personally I’ve tried every god DAMN treatment for my psychiatric disorders, Treatment Major Depressive Disorder, CPTSD - therapy included, and different types of therapy, Social anxiety disorder - this has been lifelong and ADHD - which stimulants fix, but only ADHD, doesn’t touch my depression.

I first started “aBuSiNg” opioids a few years ago, was stigmatised and wanted to get off them asap. I did, and was opioid free for over 16 months; before ever touching one; suffered immensely everyday with my depression and social anxiety, after getting clean, during those 16 months, I just got worse; and worse, and worse. Fed more antidepressants, I’ve tried over 16 different medications so far, TMS, ketamine therapy - with talk therapy, exercise - 0 runners high, 0 feelings of satisfaction after completing exercise, or anything for that matter that should induce feelings of satisfaction, I got much worse. 

It got to a point before summer started that I was considering taking myself out, I had enough. Summer was approaching, I was a vegetable, tried everything, absolutely everything. My psychiatrist said that he’s nearly exhausted everything he can try on me. I got fed up of it, took 5mg of oxycodone, felt awful because I’d “relapsed” had these pills lying around for those 16 months after getting “clean”, only for the entire 16 months of hell to be lifted off my shoulders within half an hour after taking it. My Dexamfetamine adhd medication, methamphetamine I’d tried years earlier, MDMA, other hardcore drugs never came close to the relief I got from opioids, the NATURAL feeling of relief. 

Relief such as not dragging my legs to shower myself, clean myself, get out of the house, worry about people judging me, worry about being abused, worry about every little damn thing. On top of all that, not enjoy an ounce of anything I’d see or do, it could be the most beautiful sunset, warm, sunny day, I was completely dead inside. Receive a big payment of money, be financially secure, dead inside, no emotions, no pleasure, nothing. Opioids allow me to feel this again. If I exercise on opioids, I feel satisfied, if I eat on opioids, I feel satisfied. If I do anything that should naturally induce feelings of satisfaction instead of 24:7 dread and depression, without fail, I feel satisfied when my brain has opioids attaching to its MU receptors and stimulating endorphins. 

Constantly gaslit by medical professionals that opioids bad, and they are to an extent, they can ruin your life, completely destroy it. They can kill you; they can destroy everything good in a persons life. But I believe if you can control the drug, not let it control you, and you have gone through what I’ve gone through my entire life with debilitating, life long major depressive disorder, breaking a sweat instantly when leaving my house, that NO benzodiazepine touched, or just induced worse depression and anhedonia, you’d try everything in your power to make the medicine work to keep you functional.

I’ve used ultra low dose naltrexone whilst using, and although it doesn’t stop tolerance and the addictive part of opioids, it sure as hell slows it down and makes it much more “sustainable”. 

Anybody here who relates to what I’m saying, speak up, when you have the energy to do so, because I have tried everything, everything. External before going the chemical drug route, changing societies, changing where I live, this mental hell followed me everywhere I went.’it is chemical, it’s not “exercise and you’ll feel better”. I do believe there is much more to a lot of people’s use than one can think on the surface, especially if they’ve been diagnosed with mental health issues, have struggled for a large portion of their life and have been treatment resistant to multiple medications, therapy and lifestyle changes.

How fucked is that?   
To my knowledge Naloxone, even overdosed, doesn't do any harm apart from inducing withdrawal obviously, and and it clearly doesn't have any potential for abuse. So why would anyone want to discourage people from obtaining a potential lifesaver by putting it behind the prescription barrier?

Tapering is by far the best way to quit. Not only because it avoids all the suffering or almost (and suffering matters by itself, believe it or not), but specially for one reason: it will cause much less PAWS.

You should always taper as slow as needed.

The last major time I had  detoxed/forced withdrawal I remember not being able to get a goddamn wink of sleep for roughly 13 nights until I finally couldn't take it and landed a benzo to zonk myself out.  I don't think I have had a dream since back when I used opiates, if i do still have dreams they're gone long before the time i wake up.  I never sleep longer than a couple hours at a time and falling to sleep always involves thrashing around tossing and turning and never comes easy. I had no idea these withdrawal symptoms would continue to persist long after all others have gone and that I would have to accept it as just a new part of life.  But here we are.

To all the weekend warriors, stop before it spirals.  If you can go for 12 hours without getting high , without feeling physically helplessly sick- just quit because trust me it only gets worse.

To all the snorters, poppers and boofers who ain't feeling high enough and are thinking about smoking off foil or reaching for a rig and mainlining just to see what all the fuss is about - don't.

The amount of physical anguish and dependence and downright longterm havoc this class of drug does to the human body is simply beyond words and withdrawal is miserable beyond the English languages ability to describe it.

He has tried pretty much all resources to help him quit.

I also screwed up a relationship last year because they don’t use and I do and I always feel like I had to choose them or opiates. 

I started using because of chronic pain and in the US it’s almost impossible even with a history of chronic pain and diagnosis of diseases that cause pain. I just found it impossible to buy pharma meds and heroin then fetty was much more affordable and I’m on disability and work minimal hours part time. 

I often wish I had a partner that also used and would just get where I’m coming from and someone I could use with. I know it’s a stupid thought and seems to always turn into a volition situation but I guess I just feel alone.

153,1n0trfr,Medical discrimination is ruining my life...,sallywillis1995,47,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1n0trfr/medical_discrimination_is_ruining_my_life/,"The worst decision I ever made was coming forward 5 years ago to my GP about feeling unwell when I dont take my Dihydrocodeine, he immediately cut me off and labeled me as an addict as if I chose to become physically dependent on opiates when that is the result for anyone of any age, gender or personality type. If you take an opiate drug for an extended period of time you WILL not can you WILL become dependent and you WILL withdraw if you suddenly stop taking it.

Despite this my 14 Lorazepam tablets I received for emergencies once every 10 weeks which is barley enough for one tablet a week has been taken away from me over a year ago and since I was hit head on by a speeding driver my panic attacks began when travelling in any vehicle. Those tablets were helpful not just to take but to even have in my handbag because I would be calmer knowing I had a way out if things became too unbearable so they were prescribed for that reason...

Fast forward to the present day I now have horrifically high stress hormones levels in my blood tests and a heart I've been told will need a pacemaker by the time im 40 if this stress continues despite them causing it. They know that Lorazepam was helping me, they knew becoming addicted was near impossible due to the amount and frequency prescribed yet they decided to put me on a ton of other medications that haven't helped in the slightest instead.

Whenever I ask if it's to do with my past record as an opiate addict they just dance around the question. 

Right now I am terrified that if anything happens to me and I need surgery or to go to hospital I will be left to suffer in agonising pain because of my past and I feel I'm at the mercy of whoever treats me. When I had my wisdom tooth out I wasnt given any pain relief and was told to just suck on ice instead.

Why is it that if you've been any kind of addict once that they treat you like if you so much as see another drug you'd take the whole lot because you just want to get high all the time and want to abuse every type of drug known to man. 🤦🏼‍♀️

If there is anyone here who's been in an accident or had to have surgery with the addict stigma hanging over them I'd love to hear your story or experiences to know more about what happens in such a scenario.

157,1hyngoi,It would never happen to me...Loperamide post,goldeneagle888,50,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hyngoi/it_would_never_happen_to_meloperamide_post/,"I have seen a couple of posts on here lately that reference people being on loperamide/ immodium and I wanted to give you an account of my experience. 



I will never forget the day I discovered Immodium. I read all this stuff about it on the forums back in 2014-15 era and decided to do some research on Wikipedia. 

  
ChemSpider data...Discovered in....oh there it is!! Drug class -

  
Drug Class- Opioid Agonist. 

  
Opioid?! 

  
I thought this \*mimicked\* opioids? I thought it was an opioid that didnt cross the blood brain barrier, which made it sort of less of an opioid? I did not realize I was dealing with a full fledged Opioid agonist. 

  
A few days later, it was a wednesday, and I got paid Thurdsay. I decided to go down to the local publix and steal a couple of boxes of Immodium. I knew that I had to take quite a few, so I really over did it. I took 60 pills of Immodium. 

  
As I hung out on my couch browsing reddit, the familiar opioid warmth took a hold of me. My eyes got tighter, I was scratching my nose more. Smoking cigarettes every ten minutes. But I did not know what I was in for until the next day. 

  
The next morning I woke up and was high as a kite!! Full blown opioid high!! I thought I had discovered the holy grail. A legal opiod that could be stolen, that gave me a legitimate high was available at every single grocery store in my city. They say that it does not pass the blood brain barrier...Ah yes, this is true if taken in minimal amounts. If you take a lot...in my experience 50 or more pills...It definitely crosses the BBB. 

  
Time went by, I used it as a crutch, until I found myself in rehab. Times had gotten bad, I had a schedule 1 drug arrest under my belt and was legally mandated to a rehab. The dope had turned into fentanyl by this time (2018) and when I entered my mandated treatment, it didnt take 60 pills to get me high...it took 200. 



Days turned into weeks in this facility, weeks turned into months and by month 3 of this place I was taking 300 (yes 300) immodium pills per day. I was about 30 pounds overweight, I was nodding out at my desk at cushy office job where people didn't nod out, I was getting these electrical zaps in my body that would shake my arms and legs violently and my skin was extremely dry from the immodium induced dehydration. Also, I was drinking about 2 gallons of water a day to keep myself hydrated. My coworkers would make comments to me like ""bro I have NEVER seen someone drink that much water...you might need to get yourself looked at"" , "" Do you have diabetes man?"" 



One day, a Friday, I was walking across the office and felt a shock and a sense of impending doom. Thats the only way I know how to describe it. IT stopped me in my tracks, I still remember where I wa standing in that office when it happened. Like... I all of a sudden knew something bad was going to happen and went into a panic. The whole rest of the day I felt off...I felt like something was about to go really wrong. 

  
 I had heard all of these problems with immodium and heart issues...I was constantly checking my pulse over the course of these months. This night I checked my pulse like normal...nothing.No, I mean I couldnt feel anything, there was not a pulse to be found. I began to panic, I did not have a pulse. I would press my fingers to my neck, feel where my heart is on my chest, and couldnt feel anything!! I booked an appointment for a suboxone doctor the next day. 

  
I go to the appointment the next day and on the way home from the pharmacy, I am walking to the top of a hill and feel myself blacking out, it felt like tunnel vision.  ""Uh oh- somethings wrong"", I said. I called my girlfriend and she comes to see me. I put on her apple watch....164 BPM- not good. 

  
We sped down to the hospital, They rush me inside and do an EKG, my shits haywire. Ventricular Tachycardia. The try multiple medicines, one stops your heart and restarts it, (feels like shooting coke without euphoria), and another one. Nothing was working. Doctors were running around, my bed was surrounded by 10-15 doctors and nurses. They had a look of panic on their face. 

  
They rushed me up to ICU and began to explain things, 

  
""Sir, I dont know if you understand whats going on, but its not looking good. You should call your family and tell them to come see you. We will be doing a cardioversion in a few minutes"" 

  
I declined to call my family. 

""Sir...I dont think you understand...Call your family now"" 

  
Again I declined. 

  
I always thought they would be more nice and understanding like in the movies. They were all very matter of fact and told my what I didn't want to hear. 

They told me they were giving me fentanyl citrate and would induce the cardioversion, which honestly, I was stoked on. 

3...2....1...and oblivion. 

  
beep....................beep...................beep....................beep 

  
I woke up to a smiling nurse 

""It worked like a charm. Your pulse rate is a 59. You need to thank whatever God you believe in because you really pulled out of that one :)""



The next few days were spent getting an ultrasound of my heart, a MRI of my heart and some blood work. As it turned out, I dont have any major problems from it. The fact that I was able to procure 60 suboxone right before my heart issue ensured that I would be relatively well and not dopesick during my stay in ICU. Although, 24 mg of suboxone did nothing to alleviate my knee pain, runny nose, lack of sleep, and general malaise. Immodium is powerful stuff! 

  
I don't know if its my nature or what, but I always thought I was bulletproof. I never thought it would happen to me. I kept saying that I would stop using immodium eventually/ I would quit before some serious problem happened, but I got caught up. I was extremely arrogant. I have never been narcanned (through 13 years of addictive addiction) and I always have felt like I could beat anything. I think its my nature. 

  
One other thing- If youre asking yourself why I didnt go to the hospital the night where I couldnt feel my heart....IDK!! I felt like it would go away or something. I felt like If I got on suboxone the next day it would fix the problem. I was mandated to this rehab and felt like if I told them I was using something they would get me locked up again. This was very stupid on my part but its how I felt in this moment. If I had to do it over again, I wouldve gone to the ER. I am lucky to be alive and think if I wasnt in great shape at the time, I would have died. 

  
If you are megadosing immodium, stop right now and go to a methadone clinic or get on suboxone. 

  
If you are megadosing immodium and you are doing so because you're in sober living, tell your therapist whats going on and go back to detox. I think this is super common. People use immodium because it doesnt show up on piss tests.  I know in my case, I felt like I couldnt tell anyone because I would go back to jail. If I had to do it over again, I would tell someone before it EVER got to be that bad. 

  
I have a buddy, Justin, that died from this shit. He was sitting on the couch next to his wife and ended up passing away. He didn't get to the hospital before he died. 



There is somebody reading this post right now that is laughing saying ""diharrea pills HAHA!! who the fuck gets addicted to that shit!!""

There is another person reading this post that is helplessly strung out on this shit and doesn't know how to quit, knows the risks but doesn't think it will happen to them. Please get off this shit. It is only a matter of time before you end up in the hospital fighting for your life like me. 



I am a former IV heroin and fentanyl addict. I was addicted to OCs and Opanas. I have been there, done that. I was not some kid trying to get high off ""legal drugs"" because couldnt find real ones. And there was a time during this that immodium and its high became such a part of my life, I would choose it over heroin, because I could maintain a normal life on it as well as afford it. YES, you heard that correctly, There was a time when I loved immodium so much that I would have chosen it over other opioids. 

  
But at the end of the day this is an extremely dangerous substance, please....leave this shit alone. 




Edit: one other thing I forgot to add- I began failing for methadone at my rehab. It would pop on the cup, and then be confirmed negative at the lab. So, if you do it enough, you will pop for methadone. ",32

​How often can I use without reigniting the addiction and developing physical withdrawal symptoms?

164,1o3wadc,Really makes you think why illegal fentanyl is so badly formulated...,Ok_Barnacle_2195,46,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1o3wadc/really_makes_you_think_why_illegal_fentanyl_is_so/,"Look at how illegal LSD is formulated. Why doesn't it come in pills? Because being so strong (active in the 100 microgram range), it would be difficult to dose pills precisely - potency variations could be too big, and hotspots could occur. Then you'd have your costumers bad tripping left and right, and you'd get less costumers.

But that's precisely the situation with street fentanyl. Fentanyl is not dangerous by itself, just as long as it's formulated right (such as legal pharma fentanyl).

Yet it would be so easy to correct this - just formulate it like LSD. Dissolve it in liquid, and imbue paper with it. This will lead to actually safe formulation, without big potency variations nor hotspots - which is by the way why you should do it yourself if you don't wanna die, by dissolving your fentanyl in water, filtering it (because who knows what's the stuff that didn't get dissolved), and starting with a tiny bit to gauge the potency, since even then you can't really know the potency of it.

Of course, it also doesn't help that it very often comes mixed with another sedative class (xylazine), since mixing 2 or more different sedative classes will multiply the sedation and therefore the odds of OD. 

So to avoid most of this carnage (100.000 OD deaths per year in the US alone) they would really only need to formulate the stuff like LSD (which is not even expensive btw), and sell the xylazine in separate, so that people who don't wanna play Russian roulette don't have to, and those who want to at least know how much of each drug they're doing.

Really makes you think, right...",47

   Long & short of it was,  i was locked up and detoxed for my 1st time ever! Shit was horrendous, so much so ill leave it to your imagination 
    Shortly after my release I began doing the same shit all over again. By day 3 it was a wrap, & I was off to the races. 
    My buddy however  jumped on a clinic & began to adjust back to a life of normalcy. So why not me i  thought & that was the beginning of a 30yr. run on the hamster wheel.
    2 years ago I had a seizure perhaps associated w a long night of slamming meth.
   I was rushed to the hospital by the ambulance and that's when shit took a hard turn south.
   MRIs confirmed i had M.S. as well as lesions on my 🧠. Also was diagnosed w Lyme Disease. 
  While in the hospital I had a full cardiology workover. My QT intervals were gapped far beyond a normal ❤️.  This is directly attributed to long high doses of methadone as well as Suboxen. 
For those of you who aren't aware of what a QT is its the time it takes the heart to produce its electric arc basically. 
    Jumping forward i took care of my Lyme Disease, & am being treated for my MS thankfully.
    I was advised not only by neurologist & my cardiologist that it was necessary for me to detox.
   So I checked in and was detoxed from a 130mgs. in under 12 days. 
   Ive been out of detox for only 5 days & everyday is worse than the prior. 
   My MS has been fucking w me more than ever cuz now I have nothing  deadening the misfire nerves causing spastic leg cramping etc.
    Symptoms are: loose stool, bloating, zero sleep, my legs feel like I am carrying 100lb. sandbags in them & I saved the worst Symptoms for last zero fucking energy. I mean I have NO energy whatsoever!!
    Plz if anyone could chime in & comment w/o any punk ass remarks that'd be wonderful.

I was on oxy legally for about a year and my pain management doctor cut the cord cold turkey. I never took it to get high, never wanted the high, I was in pain 24/7, self worth evicerated, my future of playing sports gone; and was on the verge of ending it. And being out of pain was the only thing that prevented me from doing it. nerve blocks did jack shit, gabapentin made me puke my guts out, and no warning the doctor said “you can’t take these for the rest of your life”. I start high school and find a plug, eventually I go to therapy(not for addiction but just mental health issues/ptsd) and get off of it. Phantom pain is much better after those years, that helped a lot to get off it.

A week and a half ago I broke my ankle on my only leg, no opiates prescribed(just take aleve bro) and just my life has been deduced to pain. I cracked out the emergency bottle from years ago and after a week of tears of worrying what’s gonna happen once I run out I call up the old plug.

I’m so ashamed of myself, I’m at a complete loss what to do. I really don’t want to get high, I just want to be out of pain. I was dealt such a shitty hand, I don’t take high doses, (one 5 in the morning and one 5 in the afternoon).

I don’t want sympathy or pity or anything like that. I just want to put my story out there to show you are not alone. This is fucked up, they give us these pills that improve our lives, safely and legally, and then they pull the rug out from under us where you have to chance it by possibly getting some pressed bullshit with god knows what in it.

I'm referring to the incorrect belief that opiod withdrawal cannot kill you.

I'm sure that the majority of those on here are also of that mindset, and it's no fault of their own, if that's what every person who is more educated on it tells you, then you're going to believe it.

But unfortunately, as I have seen first hand in a jail close to St.louis MO, it absolutely can and has been deadly. This younger guy, very clearly out of his mind and delirious, was walking around BEGGING the officers in St.charles Missouri county lockup for help. Literally over and over again, I watched him beg them for help, and tell them ""this isn't normal withdrawal something isn't right, I think I'm gonna die""

To which the response was ""get back in your fucking bunk""

Next AM his little buddy went to wake him up, stiff as wood, puke all over him, etc.

At that point they IMMEDIATELY maced the one kid who was his little buddy, cause he immediately started yelling at them telling them it was their fault.

So, mace him, and then transfer us to a pod with no phones, so we couldn't call out, where we stayed for a few days.

Now, in my take on things, if you incarcerate a person, you take on certain legal responsibilities, such as adequate medical care.

When someone is flat out begging you for help, over and over, and you refuse, you murdered that individual. Period.

Found out once I got out of prison tho that st.charles settled out of court with the agreement that they were in no way culpable for the death. Right.

But anyways, maybe had withdrawal been treated more as the medical emergency it actually is to begin with, hed still be here.

Why exactly is this incorrect information STILL regurgitated and STILL being presented as true?

A quick couple second search of Google brings up the correct data, and confirming yes it can kill.


Curious as to how many of you are still of the belief that wd actually cannot kill you?",184

I don't and never have done opiates, but she was curious about them. She bought some H one day and she said it made her feel sick, so she wouldn't get anymore.

But she did buy more. She felt good this time. I felt sick. I felt sick because i was terrified my best friend would take something laced with worse drugs or she'd take too much or someone would hurt her.

I got myself two units of Naloxone for reversing overdoses long enough for the ambulance to arrive. I was trained how to use it. We got Nitazene testing strips to keep her safe from fentanyl. 

I couldn't look her in the eyes anymore. My best friend wasn't.. *there*, right now. She was a different person right now. We fought and argued because her usage was dragging me down too. I was using drugs more often and getting into trouble and i promised my SO I'd move out. 

I moved out. We stopped talking except for the occasional argument. She hadn't been online in several days and i was worried about her. I got a phone call from the police that day to tell me she'd passed away.

I found out a few days later it was apparently oxycodone that she'd tested for Nitazenes and then taken them anyway.

173,1hempzw,Fighting cravings? My therapist just gave me a cool tool to use....,-TrueMyth-,45,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hempzw/fighting_cravings_my_therapist_just_gave_me_a/,"My therapist recently flipped the way I think about cravings, and it’s made a huge difference. I’d been telling him how much I was fighting my cravings for my drug of choice, and he gave me a completely different perspective:

**""Don't fight your craving...welcome them to your dinner party, give them a VIP seat, they aren't your enemy...don't be rude.""**

Here’s the analogy he shared: Picture your craving as if it was someone stopping by your house uninvited. Instead of slamming the door in their face or arguing with them, you say, “Come on in, take a seat. Tell me what’s on your mind.” You acknowledge their presence, hear them out, ask if they want coffee, they have every right to be heard. Then politely let them know you have other plans but appreciate them stopping by and let them know they're always welcome back, anytime.""

It sounds strange, but this kills the anxiety that normally comes with my cravings. Because I try to shake them...but they KEEP coming back stronger....and stronger...until...I sometimes use. But now I don't fight them, or even try to shake them....welcome in homie, I just made coffee! You like cream or sugar or black?

The craving didn’t disappear instantly, but it didn’t feel overwhelming anymore. The anxiety eased, and I could actually move on without feeling like I was in a full-blown battle.

So, next time you’re dealing with a craving, try this: Picture it as an unexpected guest. Let it pull up a chair, hear it out, and calmly remind yourself you’re not buying what it’s selling. The more you practice this, the more those cravings lose their grip.

Hope this helps someone out there struggling—you’re stronger than you think. Stay kind to yourself!",6

I dont use that often anymore (and I hope I'll use even less from now on) but when I used opioids more frequently, my strategy to get the best high was taking dexamphetamine because that shit gives me the most horrible suicidal crash off all drugs ive ever taken, 10000x worse than meth, and then I snorted some heroin along with some dexamph. Ngl, every time I took opioids any other way I was thinking about how fucking wasteful it is because not even kidding, if snorting a good dose pharmaceutical heroin is a 2,5/10, taking it in a dexamph crash with a amph redone is a 10/10.

178,1lmzwt8,Worst Withdrawal of my life without misding an oxy dose,1samuel127,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1lmzwt8/worst_withdrawal_of_my_life_without_misding_an/,"TLDR: I'm prescribed Oxy 5mg 3x per day as well as a SNRI, low dose Abilify, and beta blockers. Despite taking my meds regularly, after taking a shot of the weight loss drug trizepitide I was unable to absorb any oral medication. I went into withdrawal from all my meds suddenly and it was the sickest I've ever been. I ended up in the ER where they figured out what was happening.

Man, I had a weird, hellish experience last week. I'm still recovering and processing. I take several prescribed meds for chronic conditions including antidepressants, antipsychotics, beta blockers for POTS, and Oxycodone 5 mg 3x per day for degenerative disc disease and some other spinal and nerve root conditions I won't bore you with. I try to be really careful with my meds and I always keep my appointments current so I can fill on time. I have been through WD before when I had to find a new pain doctor due to the clinic closing and things like pharmacy or clinical error or out of stock  meds. Like anyone, it's a hell I try to avoid at all costs. 

Saturday night I took my first dose of the weight loss drug Zepbound (trizepitide). Sunday morning I woke up shivering and sweating with nausea, stomach pain, fatigue, weakness, body aches, and a weird burning in my throat and chest, which I'm assuming must've been reflex but felt way more intense and uncomfortable. Other than the burning and the lack of diarrhea, I remember thinking it felt eerily similar to opiate WD, but I was taking all of my regular meds on schedule. Through my research I knew that the shot caused delayed gastric emptying and delayed onset of oral meds while adjusting. I figured like instead of Oxy taking 30-60 minutes to take effect it would take more like 2+ hours. I figured I could still keep ahead of the pain by not waiting to take the oxy until it got unbearable like I typically do

Well, I didn't feel my Oxy at all. My next dose I tried dissolving in a few sips of diet soda, but that didn't seem to help. I was in bed all day Sunday and couldn't eat a thing. Even water was hard to get down. I wasn't too concerned since I'd anticipated feeling crappy for awhile after starting the meds, and not eating was to be expected. 

Well, Monday everything took a turn for the worst. I had no fever but I was shivering non stop with my wearable blanket, heating pad, two comforters, and two throw blankets. I couldn't even pick up my phone, read, watch TV, or even keep my eyes open. I also felt like I couldn't take in enough air but that must've been just a sensation or anxiety because my pulse ox was perfectly fine. I was super weak and lethargic. I couldn't get comfortable enough to sleep but I couldn't stay fully alert. I took all my meds as usual. 

That afternoon I started throwing up sips of water. My son said I wasn't making sense and he wanted to call an ambulance. He just turned 16 and he handled it so well. The paramedics came. My vitals were fine but I knew I was dehydrated so I agreed to go with them to the ER. I was on a gurnee lined up in the hallway. Shortly after, my husband got there. 

They did some blood work and chest and abdominal x rays. The doctor asked if I had taken anything for pain or nausea. I told him I'd taken my prescribed oxycodone that morning, about 8 hours earlier. He said he'd give me an oral oxy and IV fluids, tordol, and zofran.  After that they moved me under a vent and the chills got unbearable, like when it feels like there's ice inside your bone marrow and it's painful. I don't know how much time went by after the oxy and IV, probably about 2 hours. 

The dreaded restless legs started - the full body ones. It's always been my most dreaded WD symptom, but I'd NEVER experienced it like this before. My entire body was thrashing uncontrollably. I kept crashing into the bed rails and popping up and flopping back down while shaking and trying to breathe right. My legs wouldn't stop kicking. I even kicked the bed rail and bruised my ankle. I am usually really stoic and I hate drawing attention to myself or disrupting anyone. I was yelling, ""Can anyone make my legs stop?"" And whatever else. My husband was trying to calm me down and keep me covered. He told me to try to lie still so I didn't get hurt or fall, and I swear I was trying to with all my will power. I was trying to hold the bars and clench my legs together and clench my jaw to keep from yelling. It would work for like 20 seconds and then I'd pop up and sounds and non sensical words would come out. I couldn't control it. I would've done almost anything to lie still and quietly. My husband said it looked like a possesion. He said it was only about 1.5 hours before the nurse and doctor came back, but it felt like all night with constant thrashing, kicking, shivering, snd flailing. My muscles were all tensing and spasming and my whole body felt like it was submerged in pain, especially my legs. The more I moved the more I hurt and I kept hitting my arms and legs on the rails. Somehow I managed not to mess up the IV by trying to hang my arm off the bed so I wouldn't pull it. 

The doctor asked if this had ever happened before. I didn't know if I should be honest but I didn't know what else to do at this point and I didn't think I could suffer anymore. I told him I'd only ever had all these symptoms in WD due to the aforementioned circumstances, but NEVER this extreme. To clarify, I've been on the same daily dise of pain meds for 12 years, so I wasn't on a higher dose this time. I also told him I'd been taking my oxycodone and other meds as scheduled. He told me not only was I dehydrated but I wasn't absorbing any meds orally whatsoever. Nothing was getting into my blood stream. What happened was I went into sudden detox from antidepressants, antipsychotics, oxy, and beta blockers all at the same time. I've been really sick and in the hospital before. I've had bad WD. But this was so much worse. I definitely recognized the symptoms, but they came on way faster and harder than ever before, and I had just taken Oxy 3 or so hours before at my usual dose. At that point if they'd offered lethal injection I probably would've taken it. 

They wanted to do an EKG but my body was still going haywire so the doctor ordered IV ativan. Within a minute or two of the nurse putting the ativan in my IV my body finally stilled with just some residual twitching. I cried tears of relief just to stop moving. My blankets and clothes were all tangled and my hair was matted. My body was so sore, especially my arms and legs. Everything else was fine other than dehydration. 

I heard the doctor tell the nurse to give me IV morphine and I was shocked. I had a horrible ER experience back in 2016 where they took one look at my prescription list and the doctor told me he wasn't interested in treating me. I didn't even hope for any relief. I was grateful for the Ativan. This doctor was so compassionate. I don't see that much anymore. The nurse even questioned him about giving me the morphine - something about my BP I couldn't catch. I heard him tell her, ""I gave her an oxycodone and it didn't help. She's not able to absorb snything orally. She's in withdrawal since you're not supposed to stop oxycodone suddenly. She needs IV opiates.""

I could've hugged him if I could've sat up, and not just because I was happy to get morphine. I'm so used to be judged, accused, and denied care because of my opiate prescription. I've even been accused of being in WD when I wasn't - I had a pinched nerve in my neck causing migraine, numbness in my face, and uncontrolled vomiting. At that time I'd told them I'd taken my prescription 4 hours before and it was prescribed for every 8 hours, so there's no way I'd be in withdrawal. I was so grateful that this doctor treated me like a human being deserving of dignity and respect. Imo, I wouldn't be any less deserving of treatment if I was an addict. I'm not necessarily saying opiate treatment; treatment as in being spoken to with compassion and reassurance and made comfortable. I have medical PTSD (according to my therapist, I know that's not an official PTSD category). This has caused me to put myself in danger by delaying medical care for fear of disdain and accusations when I'm at their mercy. This doctor somewhat restored my faith that compassionate doctors still exists. Some of them really want to help. 

He explained to me that a small amount of people have this extreme reaction to the weight loss peptides where they don't absorb anything taken orally at all. Antidepressant WD is no joke either. I've gone through both together once before due to bad planning on my part. It was torture but I was able to push through. Granted I was a bit younger. The doctor further surprised me by offering me an oxy script which I declined since I'm under pain contract. Not that it was doing me any good anyway. He offered me a script for Ativan that I could take sublingual, which I had to clear with my pain doctor first. They told me to space it out from my oxy by at least 8-12 hours and only take it for the next few days. I figured there was no point in taking my oxy anyway. I will say as I recovered over the next 3 days that 1 mg ativan dissolved under my tounge saved me. He scripted me a 3 day supply, which was perfect to get me through the worst of it and keep my body from freaking out.

On Thursday night I was finally able to eat 1/4 sandwhich, my first solid food since Saturday night. It's now Saturday again. I'm still not able to eat more than a few bites, but hey I wanted to lose weight lol. I haven't slept in two nights but some of that is due to something weighing on my mind. Whole difftent story. This morning I tried taking my regular oxy dose and I was able to feel pain relief. The rls and chills stopped. I still feel like the psych meds are getting back into my system. I've been really depressed and anxious, but again some of that is circumstantial. 

Has anyone else had an experience with a weight loss peptide and opiate? Was my withdrawal so bad because of the side effects with the trizepitide or what? 

Also, this might sound stupid, but I'd really like to get a thank you note to that doctor to let him know how much his kindness meant to me. I have his name and the hospital name but that's it. He doesn't have an office and I couldn't find any contact info since he's an ER doc. I tried calling the hospital to see if I could leave a note with someone for him or if there was an email address I could forward it to but I haven't heard back which is totally fine. They have way more pressing matters. Does anyone have tips on how I could get a thank you note or email to him? I feel like I complain when I'm treated poorly and I shouldn't neglect to express gratitude when I receive compassionate care. I did leave him a good review on the webpage.

I'm really sorry for taking up so much time. Probably no one cares about this long sob story, but it's always helped me to process through writing. I know, have I ever heard of a journal lol. I have several but sometimes it's nice to connect and I am curious to see if anyone has any insights as to why the WD was so extreme, or if anyone by chance had a similar experience.

 Anyway, if you possibly took tome out of your day to read all that, thank you so much. Finally, if you take opiates (or I guess any pills) regularly and you're thinking of trying the weight loss shots just be careful. It doesn't mean it will happen to you. I know a few people who used it with no problems other than some mild nausea and indigestion. Just be aware that once you take that first shot it's in your system for 5-7 days. I'm not telling you not to do it, but maybe make a plan with your doctor about how best to take your meds or if you need to make any adjustments, and don't hesitate to seek care if something's off. Take care and thanks again for letting me share.",66

I've been in so much growing discomfort with my usual remedies barely working. He's  out at work today so I planned ahead and ordered a pack of Fleet enemas from Amazon Prime. Waited patiently all morning for my lunch break (working from home), and 5 mins after depositing the contents of the entire bottle into my butt, did the heavens open.

192,1l9eanb,"In a thread about the worst pain you experienced, I tried to explain the hell of opioid withdrawal to normies.   I thought it was a good attempt. How would you describe it to  someone who has never experienced anything like it?",BallFlavin,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1l9eanb/in_a_thread_about_the_worst_pain_you_experienced/,"Here’s what I wrote:



I’ve had a chunk of muscle removed from my calf due to cellulitis from to a broken needle in my leg. It got infected over several months. I ignored it until 2 weeks after my foot swole to double the size. No insurance, ya know? It looked like a cartoon.


But that’s not even close to the worst pain

I left the hospital AMA (against medical advice) within 1 hour of waking up after surgery. 

I had to get myself home. I was lucky I brought my grandfather’s wheelchair, because I kind of expected this. The hospital wouldn’t help; they said due to the liability since I AMAed “they couldn’t help me exit the building.” I get it, I guess. 

I made it to my car and the line to the vein in my arm; which I had unscrewed and left in to make life easier; it had been left open and was leaking blood rapidly. I realize now I could have closed it. But I was in a hurry.

I found a lady in the parking lot who helped me into my seat and put my wheelchair in the back. I got blood all over her, my car, my white shirt, and my wheelchair.  And I think she only did it out of fear, because of how I looked. 

I couldn’t even stand on one leg and I had no crutches. Any pressure on my left leg was just sharp screaming agonizing pain. It would drop me every time I felt it.

I had given my wallet to my GF to keep me from doing, exactly what I’m doing. I drive okay, but I have to go up two flights of stairs. I had to crawl and every inch rippled pain throughout my body. No one would help, my girlfriend wanted to punish me for what I’m doing. I’ve lost more blood than I thought and I’m tired. Agony.

It took me and hour and 15 minutes to get up two flights of stairs in a hurry. I went as fast as I could, but it was that painful.

At this point even my pants were covered in blood.  The open wound was on the back of my calf. It’s a rectangle chunk taken out of the muscle: about a quarter inch deep, 3.5 inches tall and 2 inches wide. Jam packed with gauze. 

I eventually made it back down the stairs with my wallet and crawled to the car. Also had to crawl through the gravel drive way, which was brutal since I couldn’t stop the rocks from jabbing my wound as I crawled across it. And the gravel meant no wheelchair.



But the worst pain I ever felt was what drove me to make myself go through all that pain. Not the cut out muscle.

The emptiness I felt without opioids in my system was my worst pain. 

I’d be physically sick. Yes my body was achey, my back was hurting, and my restless legs were unstoppable, But it was the inability to “be” that broke me. Everytime. Never comfortable, never able to feel comfort in any way, never even stable. Sleeping is a myth , I just black out in my thoughts for 20-30 minutes every 3 days. My body feels like it’s giving off the death rattle. My skin is always clammy, covered in sweat but freezing.

And for me, that’s my eternity if I DONT Use again. Minutes become like hours, no sleeping, no eating, no good thoughts, no way to feel anything good, STUCK IN AN AGONIZING BODY FOREVER.


Maybe I should quit but, just a few dollars makes that go away. Why wouldn’t I make literal hell end? Besides what is the reward for going through all that? I’m left in a body that hurts, in a brain that doesn’t even have the receptors left to feel happiness.

Opiate withdrawal is a hell unlike any other pain I’ve ever experienced, mentally and physically. Knowing that dope is the only thing that is going to make any of this not just bearable, but euphoric? Who could refuse that offer? What good is money if you’re agonizing? It’s worth any price to feel…okay.

TLDR: it’s a long story about how the mental and physical pain, which both are tied to opiate withdrawal, are more agonizing than any physical or mental pain on their own. That’s been my experience with it anyway.

Been sober (for the most part) the whole time. I'm tapering now and even before this my cravings were really strong. Like... I really was gonna die this last time I washed up in detox, so miserable, starving, sick, in so much pain and all I see is the ""good times"" that I'm not even sure were ever there. 


Fentanyl is not the worse drug I've ever tried but its a pretty mid opioid. What is there to even miss? Idk. I think I just hate being sober. I've done no work on my mental health. I ODed on Xanax 10 years ago and it feels like a switch flipped and never came back on. I've been addicted to drugs for 10 years. Been to three different detoxes. Like surely I've done enough drugs? Why do I still feel like I'm missing something then? 


I keep holding out hope that one day I'll get this magical supply of pure heroin and it'll last me my entire life and I can shoot up all day and all night and function just fine, keep my money, maintain my relationships. But thats insane. Can someone just tell me: will it ever get better? I cannot see my life without drugs and all they've done in the end is bring more misery. What have I done wrong actually? What moral failings do I possess that this is the situation? What I miss most of all is popping ONE fucking hydrocodone and being in utter bliss for like six HOURS. I was mad I couldn't do it more. Before I went to detox, I shot 2.5 grams of fentadope that night and barely caught a buzz. Fuck this. I didn't know how good I had it being a casual user. I would give anything to be there again.",28

196,1iona8q,Confession - Death and Theft,EasyKick66,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1iona8q/confession_death_and_theft/,"This is my confession of something I did to my cousin/best friend about 20 years ago. 

My cousin just died a couple of weeks ago. He had lung cancer, which wasn't too surprising after a lifetime of smoking, well, everything that can be smoked. 

But it was still a shock because this guy survived everything -- not one but 2 devastating car accidents, hepatitis, epilepsy, being abused as a kid, being abused in group homes and prison, getting the shit kicked out of him by cops and COs, mental illness, and his asshole of a drunk, junkie father. 

Anyway, I loved my cousin. And we were always there for each other. I'd done everything from helping him move, to letting him stay with me, to bailing him out of jail, to finding him a doctor, etc. I got him a job, took care of his dog when he was locked up, let him use my car to get to work -- stuff like that. When my uncle died, I helped clean out his apartment so my cousin wouldn't have to. 

He did stuff like that for me, too. Honestly, he did more for me than I did for him. 

We were really close. 

But about 20 years ago, I stole a bunch of drugs from him because I was a pathetic, horrible junkie. They were his prescribed painkillers for his car accident -- OC 80. Yeah -- you know. He had a whole bunch of other drugs, too, but I just took the OC80s, probably 50 of them. 

I hate myself so much. 

I never told him. I never told anyone. 

And he blamed his father for the missing pills because that is exactly the kind of thing that man would do and had done. He'd steal your money, your drugs, your car -- he even tried to steal my cousin's girlfriend and mine, too. 

And I fucking acted like that scumbag. 

At the time, I did feel a little guilty about letting that asshole take the blame. But I felt SO guilty about stealing the pills. But I never told my cousin. I never confessed. 

I didn't want to hurt him but I also didn't want to risk our friendship. I didn't want him to hate me. I knew I'd never do it again.  And we have enough problems in our family. I just tried not to think about it. I was a coward. 

When he was sick I did everything I could for him. 

But I never confessed. At his funeral I just felt so fucking guilty. All I could think about was what I had done. 

I'm saying this now to tell all of you to never, EVER steal from someone you love. I wish I'd never done it. I hate myself so much. 

Why did I do that and to my cousin that I love? 

I don't know what to do now. Does anyone have any advice? Is there any way I can make this right? 

All I can think is that my best friend is gone and I did something terrible to him and I have no right to mourn. 

I'm begging you all never steal from your loved ones because you'll just hate yourself so much. 

I'm so fucking ashamed of myself. I might take this post down. I don't know. But if you have any advice or insight, I'd appreciate it. And if you just want to yell at me, I guess I deserve it. 

Thanks for listening to all this.",35

This person is 75 and has been using patches for approximately 15 years at 100mcg/hr and issued 10 patches a month. The person has always cut them in strips and sucked on them and would take them in and out of mouth all during the day. They told the Dr. the 100mcg/hr was no longer relieving their pain and so they got another patch added to their current 50mcg/hr dispense 10 a month. The last couple of months there has been episodes where this person becomes out of it for about 2 hrs and then comes back aroused, slowly. During these 1-2 hrs he will just stand bent over or leaning over with eyes closed, when you talk to him he will respond to name but doesn't know much else. Sitting on the toilet during this time is another one. These episodes of doing this are becoming more frequent and bizarre. Even when not appearing ""high'' his memory is getting worse, hours and days have seemed to be lost. This man will not go to rehab at his age and calling the Dr. on him is just going to get meds cut off and will have no Dr., he will go into withdrawal, he does have physical and mental pain, getting cut off we worry about suicide. This man has a lifelong addiction problem. We have talked to him and told him what he is doing and taking too much and he doesn't believe even when their are videos to show him what it is doing to him. At this point, how do we know how much he is taking or is this from just chewing on the patch and never taking it out. We thought about locking up the patches or taking them and giving him like one strip a day. We don't want to find him dead but this seems like this maybe what he wants, just to go to sleep and not wake up. Please send any suggestions. ",88

Why?",Business_Accident614,44,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1iys770/22_yr_habit_on_off_sub_since_06_countless/,"To add a few details, like everybody else I've ever met, withdrawal is horrible to varying degrees. In the past, I've come off the Suboxone by tapering down to approximately 0.5 mg. Days one and two I am very sick. By day three I'm able to get out of bed. By day four, I'm functional.

Lost my plug suddenly. I was consistently taking 8 mg of Suboxone daily. I had no choice but to come off of it. 

The last time I was suddenly cut off at 8 mg my experience was horrid. Brief, but horrid. I was committed to a behavioral health facility and didn't have a prescription. I also don't want a prescription because I need my benzos. Anyway, my experience was vastly different. It took four and a half days before I noticed withdrawal, the day that I'm usually functional. I woke up vomiting violently with all the symptoms. Full blown withdrawal. I couldn't stop vomiting!. They gave me Zofran which didn't help much. After about 45 minutes of watching me be sick, a nurse showed up with suboxone so quickly I was able to get relief. That was only about a year ago. 

27 days ago I lost my plug & decided NO MORE. I'm terrified of losing my teeth. Bought a few kratom shots fearing the violent vomiting. Gathered all the comfortable meds. Tylenol, ibuprofen, Benzos, Zofran, immodium, ambien and Vistaril.

When I first felt the sniffles coming, I microdosed kratom. Kept trying, ended up using the bottle. One 15ml bottle. Soma 200mg. Bought a 2nd bottle & told my bf to put it in his gun safe and don't bring it out unless I'm puking. I explained to him what was coming & said if it's there I'm going to take it. I never needed it.

So time-line kinda went like this:
Day 1: sneezing a bit, eyes watered, kinda restless, couldn't get comfy. Pissing out my ass. Low energy.
Day 2: Much more energy. Still sneezing but eyes were normal.
Day 3: Couldve done anything, felt OK just sore. Noticed I hate the texture of my favorite blanket.
Days 4-today-day 27: 99-100% symptom free. I still get Restless and time seems to drag on. I attribute that to my body adjusting to this change.

I didn't sweat. My heart did not start racing or have any noticeable increase. It only took two Imodium to get rid of the diarrhea. My pupils never dilated. Energy was decent. There was no sweating and freezing. I slept. I do feel a little colder than normal. I doubt my blood pressure increased and never felt the need to check it. My loving partner would do anything for me. I didn't need to ask for help. If I wasn't so tuned into the symptoms of withdrawal, the whole thing could have passed me by without me noticing. I probably could have pushed through work.

Has anyone ever heard of anything like this? I haven't! HOW is this possible?!?! The best thing I can come up with is glitch in The Matrix. I wouldn't believe my story if I was reading it but I swear on my dog it is true.

I do feel some changes in my body that are normally felt after you're done withdrawing. I'm extra sensitive, physically and emotionally. I generally sneeze twice a day Now versus zero before. I'm kind of cold all the time. Sudden alcohol cravings. That is 100% of my symptoms. I think it took about 8 days before I finally realized I could calm down, if it hasn't shown up by now it ain't coming. I can't stop thinking about how this is Earthly possible.

I think sometimes it feels like opiates don’t just make you feel better. In my experience completely flip emotional pain into actual warmth or even love.
Lately I’ve been super depressed because my girlfriend left me for some asshole bully, and I honestly have no idea what happened to her. It’s been months, but if I start to ruminate e think about it, I still feel this mix of humiliation, anger, and frustration everyday that put me in crazy emotional pain. It’s unbearable. I start to think about suicide or even self-harm.

When I’m like that, if I pop two whites, in 10 minutes it all just flips. The pain, anger, the humiliation, all gone. Replaced by this insane sense of peace and love. I can’t even wrap my head around how the same thoughts that make me suicidal when sober suddenly make me feel blessed and at peace. When I check their social media while high, I don’t feel any hate or sadness. I actually feel love for her, zero resentment for the dude, and I genuinely hope they’re doing well together. So nice Mother Teresa would tell me to chill lol.

After an hour, I quickly began to spiral back into pain. I thought something like this was only possible with a powerful and empathogenic substance like MDMA.

It’s not this nice when I’m not in pain. Does anyone else get this? Like, is it just the relief, or is there some deeper neuro thing going on here? ",25

I HIGHLY recommend megadosing Liposomal Vitamin C. Here is a guide by MOD kickerS12X as well as the Ultimate Withdrawal Survival Guide. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/s/oYMqdV8Fiw

https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/s/CECBhFP2Q6

Megadosing Liposomal Vitamin C, or Vitamin C, if you can't get the Liposomal, should take away most of your symptoms. It's incredible, and you'll see a lot of heavy users absolutely swear by it, as do I. 

Remember to check the dosing on the back of the bottle, it's usually 2 - 3 capsules to make 1 x 1,000mg or more dose. A lot of those who said it didn't work usually didn't take enough because of this.

I've got Gabapentin, Clonidine, Valium, Immodium, etc, but Liposomal Vitamin C is definitely the best, although the others do help as well.

It's best to start megadosing Liposomal Vitamin C 3 days prior to quitting or tapering down.

I also take DLPA, NAC, Agmatine Sulfate and Magnesium Bisglycinate, which helps a lot with withdrawals and PAWS. DLPA boosts endorphins, NAC restores glutamate balance, Agmatine Sulfate modulates opioid receptors, and Magnesium Bisglycinate calms the nervous system—together easing withdrawal and PAWS.

I spent a lot of time researching studies and reading through posts to decide on the additional supplements to come up with ones that work and work together. 

For dosing I do 11,000mg Liposomal Vitamin C and would do 3,500mg when I wake, 3,500mg at lunch and 4,000mg at bed time. Liposomal is longer acting so can last up to 24 hours, therefore you don't need constant dosing.

During the first week I would do DLPA, NAC, Agmatine Sulfate and Magnesium Bisglycinate twice a day before lowering them to once a day and continue taking them to help with PAWS. Magnesium Bisglycinate should always stay at night to help sleep. It is best to cycle NAC. As in use it for 3 weeks, take a week off, then 3 weeks on and so on.

Don't forget Immodium for the runs!

This can also help in between dosing. As in for those who are going to be without opes for a few days.",25

215,1htj3rs,Opiates make me feel normal again ,[deleted],37,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1htj3rs/opiates_make_me_feel_normal_again/,"I know this is going to come across controversial and I’m in no way saying it’s safe, or a sustainable thing to do, but I have exhausted nearly everything my psychiatrist could try on me at this point. 

I’ve suffered with severe treatment resistant major depressive disorder, anhedonia, social anxiety and C-PTSD / ADHD for a while now which has just gotten worse with age, and with the loss of my father 6 years ago sent me over the edge. 

I have so far tried 16+ different prescription medications, TMS, Ketamine, Therapy, reward reprocessing, TDCS, exercise, diet and many lifestyle / environmental changes. Nothing has worked. 

I have lived in a permanent state of “never feeling rewarded for what I do” for as long as I can remember, apathetic and nihilistic. I could sit in bed all day, but be bored at the same time, and extremely depressed and overthink, take something to slow my thinking down; it ends up making my thoughts so down, but I’m even MORE depressed from being zombified, it’s an utter nightmare. when I am busy, I’m completely apathetic and anhedonic, the reward isn’t there, and my social anxiety makes it near impossible to function. Stepping out my door I’m in a sweat, no medication has helped this, or if it does, it causes such awful worsening of my Anhedonia that there’s 0 benefit. 

Opiates unfortunately are the ONLY substance, both illicit and prescribed, that has consistently brought me relief. - Kratom, oxycodone and the big one, Poppy seed tea. 

I was sober from using poppy seed tea for 6 months daily, eventually having to go in subs to get off it in three months, and was sober for 16+ months but those 16+ months, nothing changed, I was exactly how I was and it just reminded me why I started it in the first place. 

I’m using again, but with naltrexone, trying my best to keep damage as low as possible, because without it, simply I CANNOT function anymore. I can’t. Therapy, meds, exercise all that blah blah blah, it doesn’t work for me. 

I have spent hours upon hours in 2024 researching every night until 6am neuroscience trying to fix myself, with the help of my psychiatrist, he is puzzled as I am. 

I just want to vent as I’m feeling quite alone on this. Has anybody else found that with similar mental health difficulties, even though you’ve genuinely tried extremely hard to find a way without opiates, you don’t find relief and eventually steer back towards them? I don’t want to take an amount to get high, feeling my normal, childhood like self how I used to when I was young is euphoric in itself. I’m exhausted. 

Edit: I am on amphetamine adhd stimulants which help “get me up”, but the “reward” for doing simple tasks, even eating; isn’t there; along with the chronic, persistent social anxiety make thing impossible. Again, I’ve tried all kinds of therapy for my CPTSD to no avail. I started to feel this pre ANY substance use. ",77

I've been with my new Doctor for 2 months now and get prescribed Oxycodone 20mg tablets. But during our last visit he randomly asked why I prescribed Suboxone by another Doctor before. I was only on it for a month or so, very briefly, and hated it.

I was honest and said it was prescribed for pain management but also because I was taking lots of Kratom, since I wasn't receiving the proper care from Kaiser. They just had me on some muscle relaxers, so I basically self-medicated with Kratom. I fucked up by telling Kaiser, and got labeled as ""severe opiod use disorder,"" in my records, then went to that Doctor who prescribed the Suboxone, and he's an addiction specialist. Which is definitely why my new Doctor brought all this up. Thing is, I was up front to everyone about this, and chose myself to even bring it up, because I just wanted real proper care. I had multiple surgeries in my teens also, and was prescribed Hydrocodone, this was over 15 years ago, so doubt those would show up in the Prescription monitoring system, but it probably factored into Kaiser sending me to the Sub Doctor also? 

I never wanted to start Suboxone in the first place, for THIS exact reason of being labeled, plus it sucked ass for managing my pain anyway. 

Now I'm worried my new Doctor will cut me off the medication I actually need. I've already sent him loads of records showing my health conditions and imagery too, etc. But he's asking for the Suboxone Doctors records now, which I don't know where to even start, he was an outside Dr. Just recommended by my insurance. I think he works at numerous places including rehabs smh...

What else can I say here? My new Doc is great but idk why he's just bringing this up now. My stupid Kaiser chart just says opiod use disorder, I wish I could change it to say Kratom.

My boyfriend has been addicted to opiates for several years now. I want to help him. Today he  said yes he will go to treatment. Which is wonderful. But I don't even know where to start. We live in Northern Missouri and he doesn't have Insurance. (He does work his ass off. He just doesn't have insurance) Does anyone know of places who take people without  insurance? I have tried looking into it in the past and the cost was so high. 
He has pretty big prescription of oxys and morphine. I know he sees a pain specialist every so often too but I don't even know who that is. Any advise is welcome. Thanks in advance 

Edit: the prescription isn't the issue at all. If he could just take his script I would not complain. The problem is that he takes both full scripts in 4 days and then he's buying off the streets for the rest of the month. Not small quantities. Whole prescriptions weekly but also anything else he can get his hands on as long as it's an opiate. These people are not trusted sources and he does not test anything. 

Edit: I removed the part about calling his doctor. I would never do that. I was upset when typing the original post

Edit: for people wondering, oxys are 10mg (quantity 140), morphine is 60 mg (quantity 60). And again these are all gone in 4 days. Also, he does have pain in his wrist and fingers from an injury at work. That is why he has the prescription. I have been talking to him a lot over the last couple of days about the danger of buying off the street anymore. It's not the same as it used to be. You can't buy pills in a cellophane from a friend of a friend and think nothing is ever gonna happen just because it hasn't happened in our small town yet. Just because I talk to him and he listens does not mean he will ever stop doing it. 

Update: I did set boundaries. I moved out of the house about a year and a half ago because it just became too much for me. As of 2 nights ago I just talked to him and told him I needed space and promised him when he made the choice to get help I would stand by his side. As of right now his plan is to go talk to his old probation officer Monday and see if she can get him help. This was his idea, not mine. I hope he goes. But I'm going to leave all of that up to him and just try to be there for him. Thank you everyone for your support. You guys have taught me a lot! And as soon as I backed off he came up with his own plan. Which is really cool
